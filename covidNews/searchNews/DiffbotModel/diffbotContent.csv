2020-08-12||The Oura Ring has been getting a lot of attention lately because of its role in a number of COVID-19 studies, as well as its adoption by both the NBA and WNBA as a potential tool for helping prevent any outbreaks of the novel coronavirus as those two leagues get back to a regular schedule of play. Oura has released multiple generations of the Ring, which is a health and fitness tracker that reports a range of data, and I’ve spent the past month using one to see what all the fuss is about.

The Oura Ring is a health tracker that’s unlike just about any other wearable with a similar purpose. It’s a ring that’s virtually indistinguishable from an actual ring without any smart features, available in a couple of different designs and multiple finishes. The Ring has sensors located on the inside surface, but these barely add to its overall thickness and are totally hidden when the ring is worn.

Despite its small size and low profile, the Oura Ring is still a connected device, with an internal battery, and the ability to talk to a smartphone via Bluetooth to transmit the data its sensors collect. In the box, you also get a USB-C stand for the Oura Ring that powers it up via induction charging.

The built-in battery is good for up to seven days of continuous use — and that includes wearing the Oura Ring during sleep. During my usage, that seemed to be an accurate estimate. In general, though, the battery life just seemed to be “long enough,” prompting me not to really think about specific spans, and charging is so quick that it’s easy to just remember to put it on the dock occasionally when it’s convenient (I would often do this during the work day while at my desk, where I keep the Oura dock). Oura’s app also sends helpful notifications to remind you to charge before bed when you’re getting close to the end of your ring’s battery life.

Oura’s design for this most recent iteration of their Ring is fantastic — both as just a piece of jewelry and doubly so as a connected health and activity tracker. It’s available in two styles, called “Balance” and “Heritage,” both of which come in multiple metallic finishes. There’s a polished silver and gloss black option for both, while “Balance” has a premium-priced version with inlaid diamonds, and “Heritage” has a matte black finish option (which I reviewed).

All the various finishes ore made of a lightweight titanium, with a molded plastic inner to protect the sensors and provide transparency for them to work. The exterior finishes are all coated with a scratch-resistant outer layer — but like with just about any other metal jewelry, scratch-resistant isn’t scratch-proof. The matte black finish I reviewed is definitely showing some wear and tear after multiple weeks of use, but that’s something I was fully expecting, and it’s surprisingly resilient, given how often it comes in contact with other metal surfaces, stone and whatever else you come in contact with on a daily basis. The minor blemishes that appear lend it a pleasing patina, rather than negatively impacting its aesthetics, in my opinion.

The Oura Ring is also fixed in terms of sizing and fit, and the company has come up with a clever way to handle ensuring a good fit for customers. They offer a free sizing kit that they ship out first so you can figure out which Oura size is most comfortable, and decide on which finger you want to wear it. Size is important because you want the Oura Ring to fit snugly enough that it won’t fall off or shift around too much, but also not too snugly that it becomes uncomfortable.

Ultimately, the design is fantastic because it’s both an attractive ring, and an incredibly comfortable device to wear all day — and through the night. Unlike even an Apple Watch or other wrist-worn wearable, there’s virtually no adjustment required for getting used to wearing it while sleeping, or any discomfort from various types of bands. It’s the first wearable I’ve used where I truly was able to forget that I was wearing one at all, and it’s one that no one else will realize you’re wearing, either.

So what does the Oura Ring actually track? A lot of things, actually. It measures sleep, as mentioned, as well as various other metrics under two broad categories: Readiness and Activity. Sleep, Readiness and Activity all provide one overall summary score out of 100 to give you a topline sense of where you are, but each is actually calculated from a range of sub-metrics that add up to that larger score.

Oura’s sleep tracking is much more in-depth than the forthcoming Apple Watch sleep tracking that Apple is releasing with its next watchOS update in the fall. It monitors when you go to sleep, how long you sleep, how much of that qualifies as “deep” and how much is “REM,” and gives you a metric or you sleep efficiency, your time in bed, your total sleep time and more. Readiness tracks your ambient body temperature, heart rate variability, respiratory rate and your resting heart rate, while activity automatically measures calorie burn, inactive time, your steps and how close you are to your overall activity goal.

For all three of these categories, you can dive into each individual sub-metric and see trends over time or individual scores per day, but you also can just look at the overall score, which is provided in a feed-like dashboard in the app and accompanied by practical, actionable advise about what to do with your day, your activity or your sleep habits based on that score and how it’s trending.

It’s at once both the easiest to understand health tracking app I’ve used, and also one of those with the most depth when it comes to digging into what is actually being tracked, and what that means in greater detail. And because the app focuses heavily on establishing a baseline and then monitoring deviations from that baseline and providing advice based on that, it’s more likely to be useful and specifically relevant to you.

With most wearable tech, including the Apple Watch, I periodically have a sort of internal revolt where I end up finding them too much of an intrusion, or too much of a hassle to maintain continuous use. With the Oura Ring, health self-monitoring reaches a perfect pinnacle of combining convenience with useful and actionable information, with an unobtrusive and attractive design that actually makes me want to put it on.

The jury remains out on whether the Oura Ring can actually accurately detect COVID-19 or anticipate the onset of its symptoms, but regardless, it’s a fantastic personal health tracking device and a great tool for anyone looking to take more control over how they feel on a daily basis. And by actively establishing an individual baseline and comparing your actual overall state to that every day, Oura provides one of the best potential platforms for long-term personal wellness insight out there.||2
2020-08-12||Joe Biden’s decision to name California Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate in the quest to unseat President Trump means that the next vice president could be not only the first Black and Asian American woman on a presidential ticket in the U.S — historic milestones by any account — but also a Californian who built a career in the tech industry’s front yard.

Born in Oakland, Harris served as San Francisco district attorney and later as the attorney general for California before being elected to the Senate in 2016. And while the newly named vice presidential nominee is likely to bring a deeper understanding of the tech industry to the race, her positions on how a Democratic administration should approach tech’s most powerful companies during an unprecedented moment of scrutiny aren’t exactly crystal clear.

Harris attracted considerable support from Silicon Valley executives in her bid for the Democratic nomination, outpacing other candidates in donations from employees from large tech companies early on. While that support shifted around throughout the race and many donors in tech supported multiple candidates, the industry is likely to be happy with Biden’s selection.

Notably, Harris was elected as California attorney general in 2010 and served two terms, overseeing the tech industry through a large portion of its most explosive growth — a measure that likely proves more meaningful in assessing her stance toward regulating the tech industry than the things she said along the campaign trail.

Still, those were arguably simpler times for Silicon Valley, and ones that predated current hot-button conversations around issues like election interference, misinformation wars and antitrust enforcement.

As the primary developed and then-rival Elizabeth Warren carved out a posture critical of big tech, Harris seldom waded into thorny issues around regulating the tech industry. During an October debate, Harris avoided a question asking about concerns over second order effects if big tech companies were broken up, instead redirecting to the safer political territory of Trump’s Twitter account. Dodging meatier points about tech accountability, Harris called on Twitter to suspend the president’s account for violating its rules, calling the issue “a matter of safety and corporate accountability.”

Earlier this year, in response to a straightforward question asking if companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon should be broken up, Harris again dodged, though signaled that she is concerned in how those companies handle user data.

“I believe that tech companies have got to be regulated in a way that we can ensure the American consumer can be certain that their privacy is not being compromised,” Harris said. Harris also expressed her concerns about user privacy in a 2018 Twitter thread.

“Millions of Americans have no idea how much data Facebook is collecting, from tracking their location and IP address, to following their activities on other websites,” she wrote.

“In the real world, this would be like someone watching what you do, where you go, for how long, and with whom you’re with every day. For most, it would feel like an invasion of privacy.”

In other critiques of tech, Harris has mostly concentrated on Facebook, denouncing its role in spreading Russian disinformation during the 2016 presidential race and expressing worries over how the company handles the data it collects.

When given the chance to press Mark Zuckerberg in person, Harris zeroed in on the company’s handling of the Cambridge Analytica data misuse to its users. More recently, Harris co-authored a letter to Facebook along with Colorado Senator Michael Bennett after the audit’s largely unflattering results were published, pressing the company on election concerns.

“Although the company has shown a recent willingness to rein in disinformation with respect to COVID-19, it has not shown equal resolve to confront voter suppression and learn the lessons of the 2016 election,” the senators wrote. “We share the auditors’ concern that Facebook has failed to use the tools and resources at its disposal to more vigorously combat voter suppression and protect civil rights.”

In another letter to the company, Harris criticized Facebook’s fact-checking policies for climate-related misinformation in light of a New York Times report.

In spite of the harsh talk, Harris seems to be on fairly friendly terms with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, who congratulated her on the nomination Tuesday. Back in 2013, Harris apparently contributed to the marketing effort around Sandberg’s now-ubiquitous book Lean In, sharing her own story. Harris also spoke at a cyberbullying event hosted at Facebook’s Menlo Park headquarters in 2015 and the two were photographed onstage together.

While we have a handful of public statements from Harris about her views on tech, there’s plenty more that we don’t know. The way she positioned herself in relation to other candidates during the primary might not wholly reflect the kind of priorities she would bring to the vice presidency, and we’ll likely be learning more about those in the coming days.

Right now there are many, many crises on the table for the next administration. If regulating big tech looked like a huge campaign issue back in the pre-pandemic political landscape of 2020, conversations around police brutality and the devastating American failure to contain the coronavirus are now at the fore. Whether issues around antitrust regulation and reining in tech’s power will make it off the back burner remains to be seen, and there are plenty of national five-alarm fires to be put out in the meantime.

While her potential position as the nation’s next vice president doesn’t mean that Harris would be tasked with shaping tech policy or spearheading antitrust efforts, her deep connections to tech’s geographic hub could prove consequential in a Biden presidency and its priorities.

In spite of some question marks around her policy approaches, Harris is a known quantity for the tech industry — one who understands Silicon Valley and who, per her track record, doesn’t look keen to take on the industry’s biggest companies in spite of some recent tough talk. Whatever tech policies emerge out of a Biden/Harris campaign, the fresh vice presidential nominee is connected to tech in a more meaningful way than any other contender for the spot. That alone is something to watch.||0
2020-08-12||Facebook said Tuesday it can’t moderate its own site or its subsidiary Instagram as effectively as possible for certain categories of rule violations during the novel coronavirus pandemic, while almost nobody got the chance to appeal its moderators’ decisions in the second quarter of 2020.



Per the latest version of its Community Standards Enforcement Report, which covers the Q2 period of April 2020 to June 2020, Facebook took action on 1.7 million pieces of content that violated its policies on suicide and self-injury in Q1, but just 911,000 in Q2. (That number is down from 5 million in Q4 2019.) While enforcement against content in violation of Facebook policies on child nudity and sexual exploitation rose from 8.6 million to 9.5 million, it was way down on Instagram, where the number fell from around 1 million to just over 479,000. Enforcement of rules prohibiting suicide and self-injury content on Instagram also plummeted from 1.3 million actions in Q1 to 275,000 actions in Q2. Instagram increased enforcement against graphic and violent content, but on Facebook that category fell from 25.4 million actions in Q1 to 15.1 million actions in Q2.

Facebook Vice President of Integrity Guy Rosen wrote in a blog post that the lower number of actions taken was the direct result of the coronavirus, as enforcing rules in those categories requires increased human oversight. The company’s long-suffering force of content moderators, many of whom are contractors, can’t do their job well or at all from home, according to Rosen:

The report didn’t offer estimates of the prevalence of violent, graphic, or adult nudity and sexual activity on Facebook or Instagram, with Rosen claiming that the company “prioritized removing harmful content over measuring certain efforts.”

The Facebook appeals process, by which users can challenge a moderation decision, has also flatlined to near-zero levels in every category. The company previously announced in July that with moderators out of the office, it would give users who want to appeal “the option to tell us that they disagree with our decision and we’ll monitor that feedback to improve our accuracy, but we likely won’t review content a second time.”

Facebook took action on a far larger number of posts for violating rules against hate speech in Q2 (22.5 million, up from 9.6 million in Q1). It wrote in the report that automated machine learning tools now find 94.5 percent of the hate speech the company ends up taking down, something it attributed to support for more languages (English, Spanish, and Burmese). Enforcement against organized hate group content fell (4.7 million to 4 million) while that against terrorism content rose (6.3 million to 8.7 million).

Curiously, the amount of content that was later restored without an appeal after being removed under the anti-organized hate and terrorism rules skyrocketed in Q2; Facebook restored 135,000 posts in the first category and 533,000 in the second. It doesn’t appear that Facebook processed a single appeal on either category in Q2, suggesting the company’s human moderators have their eyes turned elsewhere. Facebook does not release the internal data which may show how prevalent hate speech or organized hate groups are on the site.

Keep in mind that this is all according to Facebook, which has recently faced accusations it turns a blind eye to rule violations that are politically inconvenient as well as an employee walkout and advertiser boycott pressuring the company to do more about hate speech and misinformation. By definition, the report only shows the prohibited content that Facebook is already aware of. Independent assessments of the company’s handling of issues like hate speech haven’t always reflected Facebook’s insistence that progress is being made.

A civil rights audit released in July 2020 that found it failed to build a civil rights infrastructure and made “vexing and heartbreaking” choices that have actively caused “significant setbacks for civil rights.” A United Nations report in 2019 assessed Facebook’s reaction to accusations of complicity in the genocide of the Rohingya people in Myanmar as slow and subpar, in particular calling out the company for not doing enough to remove racist content on the site quickly or prevent it from behind uploaded in the first place. (It’s possible that some of the surge in hate speech on Facebook is due to the introduction of more tools to detect in Burmese, the majority language of Myanmar.)

It remains broadly unclear just how well Facebook’s AI tools are doing their job. Seattle University associate professor Caitlin Carlson told Wired hate speech is “not hard to find” on the site, and the 9.6 million posts Facebook said it removed for hate speech in Q1 2020 seemed very low. In January 2020, Carlson and a colleague published results of an experiment in which they assembled 300 posts they believed would violate company standards and reported them to Facebook moderators, who took only about half of them down. Groups dedicated to conspiracy theories, such as the far-right QAnon one, continue to run rampant on the site and have millions of members. Facebook, as well as other social media sites, also played a major role in the spread of coronavirus misinformation this year.

Many of Facebook’s moderators have begun to return to work. According to VentureBeat, Facebook said that it is working to see how its metrics can be audited “most effectively,” and said that it is calling for an external, independent audit of Community Standards Enforcement Report data that it expects to begin in 2021.||1
2020-08-12||Billy Woods, the sheriff of central Florida’s Marion County, banned masks for all deputies and visitors to the sheriff’s office starting Tuesday, according to a new report from the Ocala Star Banner—a strange decision to make in the middle of a pandemic that’s still wildly out of control.

Sheriff Woods has instructed staff not to wear masks while on duty and said that any public visitors to the sheriff’s office, which currently employs about 900 people, should be told that masks are banned. Anyone who doesn’t want to remove their mask will be told to leave, according to a memo written by Woods and obtained by the Ocala Star Banner.

“Effective immediately, any individual walking in to any one of our lobbies (which includes the main office and all district offices) that is wearing a mask will be asked to remove it,” Woods wrote.

Masks are a vital public health tool to help slow the spread of coronavirus, according to the CDC, and the sheriff’s mask ban comes as Florida broke a new record for daily deaths from covid-19. The Sunshine State recorded 277 new deaths on Tuesday, with 13 of those deaths in Marion County. The U.S. as a whole reported 1,339 new deaths yesterday.

Woods cited anti-police sentiment as one reason for the new ban, strongly hinting that someone might enter the sheriff’s office for nefarious purposes and be unidentifiable with a mask.

Woods wrote, “in light of the current events when it comes to the sentiment and/or hatred toward law enforcement in our country today, this is being done to ensure there is clear communication and for identification purposes of any individual walking into a lobby.”

Florida has seen a dramatic rise in coronavirus cases over the past few months, with children being particularly hard hit. The number of Florida children under 17 who’ve tested positive for covid-19 rose from 16,797 kids on July 9 to 39,735 on August 9, according to a recent report from CNN. Overall, Florida has identified more than 543,000 cases and 8,552 deaths.

Masks were somewhat controversial in the U.S. medical community during the early days of the pandemic, but health experts in Asia immediately recognized that face coverings could play an important role in stopping the spread of the disease. It’s now widely accepted in the U.S. that masks are a public good and should be widely adopted to help contained covid-19, though Republicans tend to be the most skeptical of masks, according to several polls. President Donald Trump has also been a mask skeptic, though recently pulled a 180 and called mask wearing “patriotic.”

Florida currently has a positivity testing rate of 17.3%, according to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker, a number that indicates the pandemic is still raging out of control in the state. New York’s positivity rate is currently under 1%, which means that virus is still present, but not nearly as prevalent as places like Mississippi (20.5%) and Texas (20.4%).

Anti-mask sentiment in Florida appears to be high, relative to many other parts of the country. Recently, an anti-mask protest in central Florida made headlines for being an absurd display of stupidity. Ocala, the largest city in Marion County, passed a mandatory mask ordinance last week through its city council, but the mayor, Kent Guinn, vetoed the new order on Monday, according to local ABC TV affiliate WCJB.

Guinn insists that his constituents don’t want a mask ordinance for local businesses, even one that just states businesses should make a “reasonable effort” to get customers to wear face coverings.

“Most want me to veto it. Probably 99 plus percent,” Guinn told WCJB last week.

Marion County went for Donald Trump in 2016, with 61.7% voting for the current president, and 35.5% voting for Hillary Clinton. So while it’s unlikely that “99%” of Guinn’s constituents oppose masks, it’s not hard to believe that a majority might believe the conspiracy theories that masks are a secret plot by the world’s lizard people to make you breathe poison.||0
2020-08-12||(CNN) Coronavirus continues to spread at high rates across the US South, Midwest and West, even as the total number of new Covid-19 cases has declined since a summer surge.

Nationally, over the last seven days, the US is averaging just under 53,000 new cases of Covid-19 per day, down 11% from the week prior.

As a result of all those cases, deaths from the virus have remained high. The seven-day average of daily coronavirus deaths was just over 1,000 on Tuesday, the 16th consecutive day the US averaged over 1,000 deaths per day.

Adjusting for population, states in the Southeast are seeing the most new cases. Georgia and Florida -- states led by Republican governors who have not issued face mask requirements -- have the highest per capita new cases over the last seven days, followed by Alabama and Mississippi.

The virus's ongoing spread around the country has frustrated plans to safely reopen schools , forced college football conferences to postpone the lucrative fall season , and caused vast medical and economic pain.

"We have to figure out how to deal with this as a whole country because as long as there are cases happening in any part, we still have transit, especially now we have students going back to college," said Dr. Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. "Any cases anywhere really keep risk pretty high all across the entirety of the United States."

In Texas, state officials redoubled their efforts to get residents to wear masks and practice social distancing, and suggested people have let their guard down.

"The most important thing I could convey today that is even though the numbers of Covid-19 have improved, it has not left Jefferson County, it has not left Orange County, it has not left the state of Texas," Gov. Greg Abbott said in a news conference Tuesday.

Texas's case spike in July came after people let their guards down as the state reopened, Beaumont Mayor Becky Ames said in the news conference with Abbott. And rising positivity rates now could be the result of the same thing, Abbott said.

"There's a reason why this is happening, I believe, and that is some people feel if they're just with family members -- even if it's 50 family members -- they can let their guard down," Abbott said. "And that turns out not to be the case."

School buildings have been reopening across the country, even as new coronavirus cases among students and staff have been reported in places where in-person learning has resumed.

In Ohio, more than a third of students, totaling about 590,000 children, will return to full-time in-person learning, Gov. Mike DeWine said Tuesday.

But of the 101 largest school districts in the country, 63 will start the new academic year remotely.

Public schools in Elizabeth, New Jersey, had to scrap plans to return to classrooms and switch to virtual learning after more than 400 teachers notified the district that they could not return to campus due to "special considering for health-related risks."

Students have not yet returned to school in the Broken Arrow Public School District in Oklahoma, but 33 district employees tested positive last week, Superintendent Janet Vinson said Monday, according to Tulsa World.

Meanwhile, North Paulding High School in Georgia will announce plans to reopen Wednesday after reporting several virus cases and receiving criticism over a viral photo that showed students -- few wearing masks -- walking in a packed school hallway.

Rely on the science and avoid the politics, Fauci says

Although practices like wearing face coverings have been politicized, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday he has learned that in order to be a good public health leader in a crisis, you have to divorce yourself from politics, rely on science and be as transparent as possible.

"Completely divorce yourself from the kind of political undertones that sometimes go into an important outbreak like this," Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said as he was honored with a 2020 Citizen Leadership Award on Tuesday night by the Aspen Institute.

"You've got to stay away from that, lead by example, be perfectly honest and don't be afraid to say you don't know something when you don't know it. I find that to be a very good formula when you're dealing in a crisis."

Even with the polarization, every state in the US passed at least one physical distancing measure in March to slow the spread, researchers from Harvard University and University College London said. Those measures worked, a new study found.

Physical distancing resulted in a reduction of more than 600,000 cases within just three weeks, according to the study, published Tuesday in the journal PLOS. Had there not been preventative interventions, the models suggest up to 80% of Americans would have been infected with Covid-19.

"In short, these measures work, and policy makers should use them as an arrow in their quivers to get on top of local epidemics where they are not responding to containment measures," said the study's co-author Dr. Mark J. Siedner in a news release

Rushing, but not racing, toward a vaccine

A vaccine against the virus is anxiously anticipated, but health experts said that the US will not rush its development -- even as Russia announces its own.

"We will require any vaccine in the United States be safe and effective and meet the FDA's gold standard," US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said during a news conference from Taipei, Taiwan, adding that "this is not a race to be first."

Russia claims to have approved a "world first" coronavirus vaccine, but is only in the first step of clinical trials, Azar said. And data from those trials have not been made public.

Fauci has serious doubts that Russia's approved vaccine is safe and effective, he told Deborah Roberts of ABC News.

"We have half a dozen or more vaccines," Fauci said. "So if we wanted to take the chance of hurting a lot of people or giving them something that doesn't work, we could start doing this, you know, next week if we wanted to. But that's not the way it works."||0
2020-08-12||"We all want it to be normal, we all want our regular lives back and I have nothing but sympathy and empathy for people who do, but we're not living in normal times," he told CNN. "And that's the thing, people are just choosing to live as if it is, until it's impossible to ignore."

The number of quarantines since schools in Woodstock and the rest of Cherokee County opened last week is just that -- impossible to ignore. At least 478 students and teachers were asked to quarantine after possible exposure to Covid-19 in the first five days of classes. By early Tuesday, that number had swelled to 925 students and staff. Nearly one-third of the district's schools -- which teach 30,000 students from elementary to high -- have been impacted.

Chambers, who fears the coronavirus will spread throughout the area, which is about 30 minutes north of Atlanta, says he saw this coming. He, along with other district parents, received a letter from Cherokee County School Superintendent Brian Hightower in mid-July announcing a 77-page reopening plan.

"One day later it was voted on, with limited opportunity for the public to participate," Chambers said of the vote, which was limited to those who were able to show up last-minute. "When the committee that created the reopening plan was created there were no teachers on it and teachers were not given a chance to review it before it was published for the public."

Chambers became a well-known local activist after he wrote an open letter to the superintendent blasting the reopening plan. "I see little evidence that guidelines from (the US Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Health) were a guiding factor in creating these policies. In fact, your plan seems to repeatedly soften or ignore their recommendations altogether while seeming to envision a 'best case scenario' when it comes to young people complying with these changing rules and the teachers' ability to monitor and enforce them," wrote Chambers, a game designer. The plan now in place in schools means students do not social distance and adults do not wear facial coverings. Chambers believes students going in-person are at risk and is keeping his 10-year-old and 4-year-old at home. CNN reached out to Superintendent Hightower, who declined an interview. The school district's chief communications officer, Barbara P. Jacoby, said: "(O)ur communications efforts are focused on directly communicating with parents." On Tuesday, Hightower told parents Etowah High School in Woodstock would have close to in-person learning from the end of the day until at least August 31. There have been 14 positive coronavirus cases at the school, he said, with tests pending for another 15 students. Some 294 students and staff have been asked to quarantine. Hightower urged people to social distance and wear masks. "As your Superintendent, I wear a mask whenever I cannot social distance. We know all parents do not believe the scientific research that indicates masks are beneficial, but I believe it and see masks as an important measure to help us keep schools open," he wrote to parents. Brandy Heath, here with her family, says she expected the school district to take more precautions to keep everyone safe. Requiring masks is a decision that is being left up to individual schools in Cherokee County. Across Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp has encouraged mask-wearing but ruled out any mandates and says he supports local decision-making. A little north of Woodstock, Brandy Heath thought that sending her fourth and sixth graders back into classrooms at Freedom Middle and Liberty Elementary in Canton was definitely the better option for their learning. "I sent my son to face-to-face learning because, as any parent knows, school is the best place for our children. Their teachers are educated, and they can teach things to our kids that we can't," she told CNN. More on kids, schools and coronavirus

As soon as she heard that, Heath, who says she is immuno-compromised, pulled her kids back home for distance learning. "We expected the Cherokee County School District to keep our kids safe. To take precautions that ensure their safety. And it's not being done," she said. Back on the playground in Woodstock, Jamie Chambers said he feels sometimes like he's fighting a losing battle. In this deeply conservative part of Georgia, he says politics continue to be put before science, with even some school officials telling staff that they believe the coronavirus is a hoax, he said. Some of the parents at the park appeared less concerned about the virus. "I don't regret sending my kids to school," the mother of a fourth and fifth grader, who declined to give her name, told CNN. "They're either going to get the virus in school or outside of school, might as well send them back."||1
2020-08-12||In a series of essays called The Distance, Thomas Lake is telling the stories of Americans living through the pandemic. Email thomas.lake@cnn.com if you have a story idea.

Canton, Georgia (CNN) After 28 years as a schoolteacher, Tracy Strange knew how the first week should go. The school would smell fresh and clean. The floors would be polished. The children would be hopeful, their enthusiasm not yet diminished by the fatigue of the year. She would learn their names, teach them the basics of human anatomy, and introduce them to a model skeleton named Fred.

Tracy woke up early on Monday, August 3, the first day of school at Sequoyah High in Cherokee County. But she never left the house. Instead she drank her coffee alone and worried about the other teachers. And she cried.

"We all just want to do our jobs," she told me on the phone later that week. "We want to be alive to do them."

Tracy is 53, with a minor heart ailment and a more serious lung condition. Her father smoked in the home when she was a child, leaving her vulnerable to respiratory viruses. In 2014, a bad case of the flu became pneumonia and put her in the hospital. Now her in-laws live with her. Both are in their 70s. Her mother-in-law has diabetes and high blood pressure; her father-in-law has Parkinson's Disease and takes immunosuppressive drugs for his rheumatoid arthritis. All that to say why Tracy could not afford to bring home the coronavirus.

As Georgia's infection rate soared in July, many districts chose not to physically re-open schools in August. But in Cherokee County, an upscale area of about 250,000 in the green hills between Atlanta and the Appalachian Mountains, parents wanted a choice. According to district spokeswoman Barbara Jacoby, the county gave it to them. Students could learn digitally from home or in person at school. But teachers would have no such choice. Even if they were teaching virtual classes, they would have to do so from a school building. And students would not be required to wear masks.

For Tracy, the risk was too great. She resigned and applied for early retirement. On the Friday before school started, she went to her empty classroom and prepared it for the teacher who would take her place. She hooked up the printer, arranged the tables and chairs, and said good-bye to Fred the skeleton.

Then she went home to worry and wait. She considered herself lucky. Although she would take a financial penalty for early retirement, she could stay home. Other teachers decided they could not. Some were single mothers. She couldn't stop thinking about them.

The district's first letter came home last Tuesday, the second day of school. At Sixes Elementary School in Canton, a second-grader tested positive for Covid-19. The classroom would be temporarily closed. The teacher and 20 students would be quarantined for two weeks. On Wednesday two more positive tests were reported at two other schools. On Thursday, two more. By Friday, with a dozen positive tests across the district, more than 250 people were under quarantine. It was all happening even faster than Tracy expected.

Viral loads, lines of defense, molecular warfare. Her work felt more relevant than ever, and she was not there to do it. She imagined the children in what used to be her classroom. About 30 of them, two at each table, pressed in close for 55 minutes. Young hearts and lungs. The air circulating.

I drove up to Sequoyah High School that afternoon and watched from the parking lot as the school day ended. A breath of wind, a touch of rain. Ford and Chevrolet in the traffic circle. Three students walked to the flagpole and lowered the flags. By Tuesday night, with nearly 60 positive tests in the Cherokee County system, more than 900 people would be under quarantine. Etowah High School would be forced to close.

Other schools would remain open. People would do what they wanted. These choices would have consequences, for themselves and for others, and some of those consequences would be shattering and irreversible. At Sequoyah, the children dispersed. It was just another afternoon outside another high school in a nation grappling with the meaning of freedom. A girl drove off in a Jeep Liberty. The players got ready for football practice.||1
2020-08-12||At least 800 people died around the world because of coronavirus-related misinformation in the first three months of this year, researchers say.

A study published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene says about 5,800 people were admitted to hospital as a result of false information on social media.

Many died from drinking methanol or alcohol-based cleaning products.

They wrongly believed the products to be a cure for the virus.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously said that the "infodemic" surrounding Covid-19 spread just as quickly as the virus itself, with conspiracy theories, rumours and cultural stigma all contributing to deaths and injuries.
• Coronavirus vaccine: When will we have one?

Many of the victims had followed advice resembling credible medical information - such as eating large amounts of garlic or ingesting large quantities of vitamins - as a way of preventing infection, the study's authors say. Others drank substances such as cow urine.

These actions all had "potentially serious implications" on their health, the researchers say.

The paper concludes that it is the responsibility of international agencies, governments and social media platforms to fight back against this "infodemic", but tech companies have been criticised for their slow and patchy response. In the UK, laws to regulate online harm might be several years away.

The BBC's own investigations found links to assaults, arson and deaths as a result of misinformation about the virus, and spoke to doctors, experts and victims about their experiences.

Online rumours led to mob attacks in India and mass poisonings in Iran. Telecommunications engineers have been threatened and attacked and phone masts have been set alight in the UK and other countries because of conspiracy theories that have been incubated and amplified online.

Social media also helps scammers to take advantage of the pandemic, selling ineffective badges that claim to ward off the virus, and urging followers to part with money in exchange for a "mineral miracle supplement", which is - in reality - diluted bleach.

As vaccines emerge, there is the further threat that anti-vaccine campaigners will use the platform provided by social media to persuade people not to protect themselves.

Despite social media companies removing or labelling misleading information about vaccines, recent polling in the United States showed that 28% of Americans believe that Bill Gates wants to use vaccines to implant microchips in people.

The achievement of an effective coronavirus vaccine could be completely undermined by misinformation, doctors told the BBC's anti-disinformation team.

2020-08-12||The damage caused by last week's deadly explosion in Beirut continues to hamper healthcare in the Lebanese capital.

The World Health Organization (WHO) assessed 55 healthcare facilities in the city and found that half of them were "non-functional".

Three major hospitals had to close and three more had to reduce their capacity following the blast.

The WHO also warned that in some facilities Covid-19 prevention measures were not being adhered to.

More than 200 people died and more than 6,000 were injured in the blast, according to the city's governor Marwan Abboud. The explosion was caused by more than 2,700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely at the city's port.

On Tuesday, people in Beirut marked the moment the blast hit exactly a week earlier.

There has been outrage that so much explosive material was allowed to be stored in the port. The government resigned on Monday following angry street protests.

What's the state of the hospitals?

Dr Richard Brennan, the WHO's regional emergency director in the Eastern Mediterranean, said that they had assessed 55 primary healthcare clinics in Beirut.

Of those, just over half were found to be "non functional", leaving Beirut short of 500 hospital beds as it continues to deal with thousands of injured residents.

• What we know about the blast

The WHO said its priority was to get those hospitals and clinics that had closed, up and running as fast as possible. Dr Brennan said that to ensure supplies got to those who needed them, the WHO was distributing them directly to health facilities it had identified in its own assessments.

He stressed the importance of restoring health facilities to their full capacity both to treat those injured and to deal with a recent surge in daily coronavirus cases.

Lebanon has had 7,121 confirmed cases of coronavirus, according to health ministry figures released on Tuesday. There have been 87 Covid-related deaths.

Dr Brennan praised Lebanon's response to the pandemic, saying it had done an "impressive job" tackling it.

But he warned that there had been "an uptick in the number of cases prior to the blast". He added that the country had registered its highest number of daily cases on Tuesday.

"While we have to still continue to respond to the consequences of the blast, we also need to stay vigilant with respect to Covid," he urged.

He said he thought it was possible to "get on top" of the recent acceleration in cases if the response was stepped up.

What's the damage in the city?

Hundreds of buildings were destroyed by the blast, leaving parts of the city looking like a war zone. Many historical buildings are among those damaged.

On Wednesday, the authorities announced a ban on the sale of these old buildings to prevent several historical districts from being gutted by developers seeking profits.

The fear is that these traditional homes could be torn down and replaced by high-rise apartment blocks as has happened in other parts of Beirut in the past.

There have also been concerns that Lebanon could soon run low on bread as the silos in the port storing its grain supplies took the brunt of the blast.

But the Lebanese economy minister, Raoul Nehme, tweeted that the country had enough supplies of flour for the next four months.||1
2020-08-12||BARCELONA (Reuters) - A Barcelona player has tested positive for the novel coronavirus after reporting back for pre-season training, the La Liga side said in a statement on Wednesday .

Barca said the player was isolating in his home and was asymptomatic, adding that he had not been in contact with any of the players who are to travel to Lisbon for the Champions League ‘Final Eight’ tournament.||1
2020-08-12||OSLO (Reuters) - Norway said it would reimpose quarantine measures on travellers from more foreign countries and reiterated its advice that Norwegians should avoid going abroad amid a jump in the number of new coronavirus cases.

Norway diagnosed 357 people with COVID-19 last week, the highest since April, but still well below the record 1,733 cases found in a single week in late March, data from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) showed.

“We’re doing this now so that everyone as soon as possible will be able to live their lives as freely as possible,” Prime Minister Erna Solberg told a news conference.

“All foreign travel is associated with a risk of infection,” Solberg said.

Norway last week put on hold a plan to further reopen society and urged its citizens to refrain from foreign travel.

While not a member of the European Union, Norway belongs to the passport-free Schengen travel zone. It had some of the strictest travel restrictions in Europe in the early phase of the pandemic before gradually lifting them from June.

It will now reimpose 10-day quarantines from Saturday for all travellers from Poland, Malta, Iceland, Cyprus and the Netherlands, as well as the Faroe Islands and some Danish and Swedish regions.

Norway has already reintroduced similar constraints for Spain, France, Switzerland and several others, and has put on hold a plan to permit leisure travel from some non-European countries, which has been banned since March.

The recommendation not to go abroad will remain in place until Oct. 1.

With a population of 5.4 million, Norway had reported a total of 9,750 cases as of Wednesday, with 256 deaths.

Still, hospitalisations have barely risen in recent weeks, FHI director Line Vold said.

“This may be because hospitalisations typically come at a later stage of the illness, and also because there are more young people being infected,” Vold said.

Authorities are also discussing whether to update guidelines on the wearing of face masks in crowded spaces which, for now, is not recommended.||0
2020-08-12||ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece reported 262 new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, its highest daily tally since the start of the coronavirus outbreak in the country.

The latest jump in cases brings the total number of infections in Greece to 6,177 since its first case surfaced in late February. There have been 216 deaths recorded.

Of the new cases, 85 were registered in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki and 66 in the capital Athens.

The increase in infections in recent weeks has prompted authorities to gradually introduce more restrictions during the peak of the tourism season.

From Aug. 17, visitors arriving from Sweden, Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic will need proof they have tested negative for the novel coronavirus to gain entry. The test cannot be older than 72 hours prior to arrival.

The same requirement will apply to all visitors entering Greece via land borders. A negative test is already required for passengers arriving with a flight connection from Bulgaria, Romania, the United Arab Emirates and Malta.

Civil aviation authorities on Wednesday extended a ban to flights from Turkey until Aug. 31 and restricted flights from Albania and North Macedonia to Athens airport only.||1
2020-08-12||(Reuters) - Singapore on Wednesday reported 42 new COVID-19 cases, its lowest daily count in about four and a half months.

The city-state went into a lockdown in mid-April after mass outbreaks in cramped migrant worker dormitories pushed its caseload to one of the highest in Asia.

Last week, it said it had cleared infections from all of the dormitories - housing around 300,000 workers - barring some blocks which continue to serve as isolation zones.

Of Wednesday’s cases - its lowest tally since March 29 - the majority were among those remaining workers serving quarantine.||1
2020-08-12||(Reuters) - Venezuelan oil minister Tareck El Aissami said on Wednesday he had recovered from the novel coronavirus, a month after he tested positive for COVID-19.

El Aissami, who is also the OPEC nation’s economic vice president and was named to the position of oil minister earlier this year, said on Twitter he had received a negative result on a rapid test for the virus.

“Thanks to President Nicolas Maduro and [first lady] Cilia Flores for all their support and strong prayers,” El Aissami wrote. “We have overcome.”

Venezuela, whose oil industry and economy have unraveled during Maduro’s six-year tenure, has reported 27,938 cases of the coronavirus and 238 deaths.

Besides El Aissami, the most prominent member of the ruling socialist party who has tested positive is Diosdado Cabello, who presides over the government-friendly National Constituent Assembly and is widely recognized as Maduro’s second-in-command.

Cabello has rarely been seen in public since testing positive in early July, though last week state-funded media outlets published images of him standing and waving outside a health clinic.||0
2020-08-12||BRASILIA (Reuters) - The Brazilian state of Parana on Wednesday reached a deal with Russia to produce a COVID-19 vaccine that Moscow has touted as the first to market, the state’s press office said, although details of the agreement were not immediately available.

Parana state had said on Tuesday it was in talks to produce the vaccine, although it was unclear if the state’s research institute would get the necessary regulatory approvals from Brazil’s federal government.

The state press office said the head of the Parana Technology Institute (Tecpar) would host a news conference to discuss the memorandum of understanding at 4:30 p.m. local time (1930 GMT).

The Russian vaccine has grabbed headlines and raised safety concerns for going to market while other pharmaceutical companies are still carrying out mass testing.

Brazil has the world’s worse coronavirus outbreak outside the United States, with over 3 million confirmed cases and 100,000 deaths, making it a global hub for testing coronavirus vaccines, including British and Chinese candidates.||0
2020-08-12||(Reuters) - British infrastructure contractor Balfour Beatty (BALF.L) sank to a 26 million pound pretax loss in the first half of 2020 as the COVID-19 crisis hampered construction work at several sites across its business.

But the company said it expects its earnings-based businesses, which include UK construction, U.S. construction and support services, to recover steadily through second half of the year, with overall operating profit returning to levels roughly equivalent to that for 2019 next year.

Although Britain’s construction industry expanded at the fastest rate in almost five years in July, according to a survey released last week, the sector has a long way to go before output returns to pre-COVID levels.

Balfour Beatty said its order book rose 20% to 17.5 billion pounds ($22.84 billion), helped by contracts for High Speed 2 - a rail line connecting London to northern England.

The London-headquartered company said it would look to re-instate dividend payments as soon as appropriate.

It reported a first-half profit of 63 million pounds last year.||1
2020-08-12||Aug 12 (Reuters) - Shares of Moderna Inc rose 11% on Wednesday after the company signed a $1.5 billion deal with the U.S. government for the supply of its experimental coronavirus vaccine.

Moderna will provide about 100 million doses, with the price coming to around $30.50 per person for a two dose regimen.

The company’s vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273, is one of the few that have already advanced to the final stage of testing and is on track to be completed in September, the company said this month.

The deal confirms that Moderna’s experimental vaccine is one of the leading contenders, said BMO analyst George Farmer, who has an “outperform” rating on the stock.

Effective vaccines and treatments are seen as essential in halting the COVID-19 pandemic, with the United States and the UK spending billions to reserve supplies of experimental vaccines.

Other countries, including Japan and EU members, have also signed deals for potential vaccines from AstraZeneca Plc and Pfizer Inc.

With the U.S. contract now signed, other deals could follow, said Jefferies analyst Michael Yee, who has a “buy” rating.

“We assume other countries ... will want to secure deals out of sheer responsibility before the capacity of the major 3-4 players is locked up.”

The U.S. deal would pay out in full if the vaccine achieves certain regulatory milestones before Jan. 31, 2021. (bit.ly/2CjrpKr)

Moderna shares, which have more than tripled and are among the top percentage gainers on the Nasdaq biotech index this year, were trading at $76.75 before the opening bell.||2

2020-05-27||Before the hWJC transplantation, the patients had symptoms of high fever (38.5 °C ± 0.5 °C), weakness, shortness of breath, and low oxygen saturation. However, 2~7 days after transplantation, all the symptoms disappeared, and the oxygen saturations rose to 98% at rest. In addition, no acute infusion-related or allergic reactions were observed within 2 h after transplantation. Similarly, no delayed hypersensitivity or secondary infections were detected after treatment.

Both fever and shortness of breath disappeared on the 2nd day after hWJC transplantation. Chest CT imaging showed that the ground-glass opacity and pneumonia infiltration had largely reduced on the 6th day after hWJC transplantation (Fig. 1C-1–C-4). The CT score of the pulmonary involvement [16] was represented in Table 1.

The immunoregulatory function of hWJCs contributed to the main efficacy outcome. As shown in Fig. 2, the percentage and counts of CD3+ T cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell were increased, which indicated that the immune function of patients was improved after the hWJC administration. Meanwhile, the levels of plasma CRP and inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-α) were all decreased after hWJC treatment (Fig. 3). All these results indicated that the inflammation status of the patient was alleviating quickly.

For the critically severe patient, before hWJC transplantation, COVID-19 nucleic acid was positive. Six days after transplantation (March 1), COVID-19 nucleic acid turned to be negative.

The cure of COVID-19 is essentially dependent on the patient’s own immune system. The virus infection caused a total function failure of the lymphocytes, even of the whole immune system [6, 17]. However, when the overactivated immune system kills the virus, it produces a large amount of inflammatory factors, leading to severe cytokine storms [6, 15]. The cytokine storms deteriorated the patient’s states which may cause the disabled function of endothelial cells and the capillary leakage and could lead to multiple organ failure [3, 6].

MSC therapy can inhibit the overactivation of the immune system and promote endogenous repair by improving the microenvironment [6]. After entering the human body through intravenous infusion, part of the MSCs accumulates in the lung, which could improve the pulmonary microenvironment, protect alveolar epithelial cells, prevent pulmonary fibrosis, and improve lung function [12, 13]. Meanwhile, recent studies suggest that MSCs played the vital immune modulation roles on lymphocyte subsets and can secrete anti-inflammatory factors to prevent the cytokine storm [6, 9, 11].

Our results showed that the administration of intravenous injection of hWJCs significantly improved the inflammation and immune situation in severe COVID-19 patients. After hWJC adoptive transfer, no obvious side effects were observed, indicating it was well tolerated. The serum CRP and inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-α) of the patient were gradually reduced, and some other vital signs were also improved. The trachea cannula was also pulled off, and the patient could ambulate on the ground from February 26 as well. Meanwhile, the counts of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell were remarkably increased after intravenous injection of hWJCs. All these results suggested that transplantation of hWJCs could improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients maybe through regulating inflammatory response and promoting the recovery of antiviral immune cells and organs.

In addition, emerging evidences indicate that the epithelial and endothelial regulated cell death (RCD) caused by inflammation is closely related to the pathogenesis of many pulmonary disorders [18]. MSCs are known to improve cell survival and prevent apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis occurring in various parenchymal or nonparenchymal cells and immune cells under unfavorable conditions [18, 19]. The assessment of the ability of hWJCs in modulating RCD would certainly benefit patients receiving hWJC therapy, particularly those with COVID-19. Therefore, how hWJCs can counteract cell death and promote cell regeneration should be discussed in the future.||0
2020-05-27||South Korea’s highest-profile investment in basic research is in the Institute for Basic Science (IBS), a network of research centres that comprises the nation’s answer to Germany’s Max Planck Society and Japan’s RIKEN.

Founded in 2011 after a 2007 promise by conservative, Lee Myung-bak, during his successful campaign for the country’s presidency, the institute sought to attract elite researchers from at home and abroad by giving successful individual applicants, as centre directors, full autonomy over their centre’s research and a budget of 10 billion won (US$8.2 billion) per year for ten years.

The centres cover areas including dark matter, nanomaterials, genome engineering and climate change. But, after criticism that they were taking money away from the greater scientific community, the goal of 50 centres has been reduced to 30 for now, with average budgets trimmed to about 6 billion won.

IBS president, Noh Do Young, warns that the cuts are “likely to inhibit IBS’s efforts to fulfil its missions and visions”, arguing that the budgets are not large, considering centres can employ dozens of researchers each.

Many IBS researchers say the level of funding has helped their research reach new heights. For instance, in March 2020, the Center for RNA Research at Seoul National University used cutting-edge sequencers purchased with IBS funds to become one of the first research groups in the world to sequence the transcriptome — the total product of all expressed genes — of the coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic1. The sequencers can directly identify the molecules in RNA sequences, as well as where they are modified by other molecules. Narry Kim, a biochemist and the centre’s director, says the work required an interdisciplinary team of virologists, microbiologists and computational scientists, which was enabled by IBS’s steady support. “Without IBS funding, I don’t think it would have been possible,” she says.

Among other prominent IBS results, the Center for Genome Engineering supplied the gene-editing tools in a blockbuster 2017 study2 in Nature that claimed the CRISPR–Cas9 gene-editing system was used to correct a mutation that causes heart disease in viable human embryos by replacing the mutated copy from the sperm with the correct gene from the egg. The results have been hotly debated, as some scientists argue there could be alternative explanations.

In 2018, results reported in Nature3 by the Center for Underground Physics, from its laboratory in a subterranean power plant in Yangyang County near the country’s east coast, ascribed constraints to the theorized particles that could make up dark matter. And in 2019, a collaboration including the Center for Climate Physics in Busan proposed in Nature4 that the first ancestors of modern humans came from a prehistoric wetland in modern-day Botswana, roughly 200,000 years ago. The work combined the centre’s supercomputer climate models with a genetic analysis of populations in Namibia and South Africa.

IBS came under heavy scrutiny in 2019, when reports surfaced in South Korean media of misappropriated funds and nepotism in hiring, which had allegedly been uncovered by government audits, at several centres. Doochul Kim, a physicist who was president of IBS at the time, said these were mostly the result of administrative errors and that the audits were politically motivated by liberal lawmakers. In late 2019, Kim announced reforms to IBS’s administrative structure, to be carried out under his successor, Noh, who started in November 2019.

The year 2020 marks another significant milestone for IBS: the first group of centres are coming up for review. Unlike at the Max Planck Society, centre directors at IBS are not awarded a lifetime appointment, and centres are subject to a make-or-break review after eight years to determine if they will be extended beyond their original ten-year remit. “This review session will shape the future of IBS,” says Noh. He says centres may close as a result, although new centres may take their place. (Noh adds that the process may be delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, if crucial on-site visits by international reviewers, scheduled for July, cannot go ahead.)

The model has its advocates. “I like that pressure,” says Andreas Heinrich, who left IBM Almaden in San Jose, California, to lead the IBS Center for Quantum Nanoscience in Seoul. “If I cannot build a top-class research centre in eight years, either I’m not the right person for the job, or it’s not possible in that environment.”||0
2020-05-27||When it comes to funding research, South Korea is in rarefied air. As a percentage of its gross domestic product, its spending on research and development is second only to Israel’s.

The speed of this ascent has been dizzying, up from 2.1% of its gross domestic product in 2000, when it was equal to the average of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member nations, to more than 4.5% in 2018, with Israel alone surpassing it at 4.9%, according to the latest available figures.

But this surge has not been even. Rather, it has favoured top-down, government-directed projects intended to boost competitiveness in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics and materials, often in partnership with the private sector, consistent with the post-war focus on applied research that turned South Korea into a leader in semiconductor manufacturing and wireless communication networks.

New priorities, however, have taken root. For the past decade, the necessity to invest in basic research has been a common refrain from South Korean researchers and politicians alike. To maintain economic growth, the nation has sought to become a ‘first mover’, instead of simply a ‘fast follower’ — rhetoric embraced by the current liberal president, Moon Jae-in, and his predecessor, the conservative Park Geun-hye. The drive to compete more effectively in strategic fields continues, but South Korea has begun emphasizing bottom-up funding for small teams of researchers, betting that strength will flow from the creativity of its scientists.

On paper, the rhetoric is backed by funding. Under President Moon, who was first elected in 2017, the basic-research budget for South Korea’s main funding agency, the National Research Foundation (NRF), has skyrocketed under a five-year plan to double it by 2022 to 2.5 trillion won (US$2 billion). The nation’s budget for 2020 allows for a remarkable 18% increase from the previous year in government spending on research and development (R&D), to 24.2 trillion won.

In the private sector, which makes up roughly three-quarters of R&D spending, basic-research spending is also surging, including outlays by major conglomerates such as Samsung and LG Electronics. “Industry is asking universities to produce more and more PhDs,” says Han Woong Yeom, a physicist at Pohang University of Science and Technology and vice-chair of Moon’s presidential advisory council on science and technology. “The situation cannot be better than this, in terms of investment.”

Spending surged over the past two decades on large national projects, such as a lunar orbiter scheduled for launch in 2022, a nanomaterials research effort dubbed the ‘Creative Materials Discovery Program’, and Korea’s branch of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, the main experiment of which is under construction in southern France. “Previously, more emphasis was on the mission-oriented research towards immediate economic output,” says microbiologist, Jung-Hye Roe, whom Moon tapped to lead the NRF in 2018.

There is a new emphasis on bottom-up funding through NRF grants. Currently, the NRF accounts for slightly more than one-quarter of total government-funded research, with a budget of close to 7 trillion won in 2020. The amount spent on basic-research grants to principal investigators is now roughly equal to that spent on top-down, mission-oriented projects, and Roe hopes to boost the basic-research grants still further.

Recent highlights from these grants include: a gallium arsenide nanoresonator that can trap light and change its colour, work published in Science1 in January and co-led by Hong-Gyu Park of Korea University in Seoul; atmospheric observations from Gosan-ri on Jeju Island as part of an international study2, co-led by Sunyoung Park of Kyungpook National University in Daegu and published in Nature in 2019, that identified eastern China as a major source of the emission of chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals that destroy the ozone layer that are banned under the Montreal Protocol; and the finding that the development of osteoarthritis is related to how the body processes cholesterol, in a 2019 Nature study3, led by Je-Hwang Ryu of Chonnam National University in Gwangju and Jang-Soo Chun of the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology.

The top-down division can claim successes too, including playing a key role in the nation’s ability to quickly develop and produce diagnostic kits for COVID-19, says Roe. The first four companies to win urgent-use approval for their tests had all received NRF funding to research the production of such kits after the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea infected 186 people and killed 36. And in February, the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, responsible for the nation’s space programme, launched the Cheollian 2B satellite; its main instrument, the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) is designed to monitor air pollution in the Asia-Pacific region, making it the first of a new generation of satellites intended to study global air quality.

An emphasis on government-mandated metrics in hiring and promotion, which critics say incentivizes researchers to present work of little value in low-quality journals or conferences, remains to be addressed. Last May, the nation’s education ministry reported that 574 researchers had participated in international conferences organized by ‘predatory publishers’. “That happens because, so far, we have emphasized getting large numbers of quantitative, shallow publications,” says Roe.

“I think this old-style culture is prohibiting the booming of our creativity,” says Yeom. “This may still be good enough to produce many papers, but not original ideas.”

The outlook is uncertain. Not only does the expected heavy economic burden of recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic threaten to curb the growth in R&D budgets, but South Korea’s traditional industries — including chip-making, ship-making and nuclear power — face increased competition from China. Political tensions with Japan that flared in July 2019, fuelled by that nation’s legacy of colonial rule, threatened to cut off supplies of key materials for semiconductor production, exposing how heavily the nation’s technology industry relies on Japanese manufacturers.

There is talk in policy circles of a science and technology new deal — a boost in funding and programmes to combat the effects of a less globalized world in which South Korea’s access to scientific supplies and talent is reduced, says So Young Kim, director of the Korea Policy Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, a think tank affiliated with KAIST in Daejeon. Yeom says researchers stand to benefit from a public appetite for societal change, which also translates into support for increased science funding. Yeom and other policymakers are pushing for greater investment in research topics that meet the practical needs of South Korean society, such as air pollution, and an ageing population. In response, the Moon administration has begun an initiative to trace and reduce fine particulate matter across northeast Asia, and another to fight dementia.

Some suspect it will be initiatives such as these that do most to move South Korea away from the label ‘fast follower’. “The definition of top-level research doesn’t need to be the highest impact factor or highest citation count,” says Roe. Pursuing research directions that benefit South Korean society is “making our own path, a new path, rather than following others”.||2

2020-06-25||“Let's try to make something good out of something really bad,” says “Survivor: Africa” winner, and lymphoma survivor, Ethan Zohn.



Living with cancer can be an isolating experience. The key to getting through it, says “Survivor: Africa” winner and lymphoma survivor Ethan Zohn, is to push through the uncertainty and reach out for help, whether from friends, family, or fellow patients who understand the struggle.In a recent interview with CURE® , Zohn opened up about what helped him through his own diagnosis of a rare form of Hodgkin’s lymphoma at age 35, after appearing on the hit reality show “Survivor” and playing professional soccer earlier in his life.“My advice for someone who's facing a recent diagnosis is to surround yourself with the family and friends that care for you the most,” said Zohn. “Be vulnerable and open enough to ask for and receive help, as well. I think that's important.”While Zohn noted that it can be difficult to find and make connections with others, some organizations exist solely to help patients with cancer bridge that gap. Zohn credits groups like Stupid Cancer and Imerman Angels with helping him through his own cancer treatment and recovery. “If you're not the type of person who's going to want to call up or talk to a shrink, there are incredible programs (out there),” said Zohn.Creativity and mindfulness are other important factors that Zohn says helped him get through his own diagnosis, particularly during the long stretches in isolation while recovering from two stem cell transplants. “Everyone talks about being creative in isolation,” Zohn said. “I agree, it's good, being creative sparks your mind in a different way and helps pass the time in isolation. But in addition to that, it's a way to connect with other people.”Focusing on non-cancer related things like art classes, yoga or meditation classes that may be more readily available online now due to the COVID-19 pandemic could be helpful for patients or survivors to branch out of their comfort zone and connect with others. “This is a good way to break down barriers, distract yourself from the reality of what's going on in your life right now, and connect with others in a way that might not be around cancer that might make you feel a little bit comfortable.”Finally, finding a purpose is one of the best ways to cope with cancer. “I live by the saying to ‘never let a crisis go to waste’, because it's an opportunity to do some really important things,” said Zohn.After he received his diagnosis and took some time to determine his treatment plans and contemplate his future, Zohn then turned his focus to helping others by sharing his story. “Here I was using my cancer nightmare, the worst thing that could possibly happen to me, to help others in the world, said Zohn. “Helping others get diagnosed earlier, helping them manage their cancer care has been made it worthwhile for me to talk about my journey.”“Let's try to make something good out of something really bad.”||2
2020-06-25||TORONTO, June 25, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- ACLU president Susan Herman today said a 2015 report on the Minneapolis police proved the department was "highly racist" – five years before one of its members killed George Floyd this May. Herman made the remarks at the 30,000-attendee online conference Collision from Home, produced by the team behind Web Summit – the world's largest tech conference.

"In 2015 the ACLU did a report on the Minneapolis police department, which showed clearly that the Minneapolis police department was highly racist – they were arresting people over eight times as often for minor offences. And so the police department did adopt some minor reforms. They were doing bias training – and, hey, it didn't work. It's not enough," said Herman.

Herman articulated her vision for defunding the police, something she said is "misunderstood" and that "makes people nervous", adding, "The people who are afraid of defunding the police are the people who are fortunate enough to be in a position where the police make them feel safe. Not everyone feels safer when the police are around – some people feel more threatened."

Herman said defunding the police means reconsidering when we want police-based response to societal issues or whether different responses would be both more appropriate and effective.

"A quarter of the people who police end up arresting are people who have mental health issues and people who are acting strangely. So if we had real mental health services to deal with these people, or if we dealt with homelessness or drug addiction, in ways other than having the police have a major footprint all over the place. Number one we would be reducing the opportunities for the police to be effecting what I think almost inevitably is arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement."

"And number two we could use the money in better ways. The city of Los Angeles spends almost a third of its city budget on policing. They just agreed to reduce that by some, but the idea of defunding is maybe we could use that money in better ways that would actually keep us safer," said Herman.

Susan Herman is president of the ACLU. She holds a chair as centennial professor of law at Brooklyn Law School, where she teaches constitutional law, criminal procedure, and a new seminar titled 'Covid-19 and the Constitution'.

Collision is known by CBC as the "TIFF for tech", while Inc. Magazine calls it the "fastest-growing tech conference in North America". Collision is set to move online for 2020 with Collision from Home. Collision will return to Toronto as a physical event for the second year from June 21-24, 2021 at the Enercare Centre.

Forbes says Web Summit is "the best tech conference on the planet"; Bloomberg calls it "Davos for geeks"; Politico, "the Olympics of tech"; The Guardian, "Glastonbury for geeks"; and, in the words of Inc. Magazine, "Web Summit is the largest technology conference in the world".

Whatever Web Summit is, it wouldn't be possible without an incredible team of over 200 employees based in Dublin, Lisbon, Toronto and Hong Kong, including world-class engineers, data scientists, designers, producers, marketers, salespeople, and more. They've disrupted an old industry by building incredible software and designing mind-blowing events, revolutionising how people and ideas come together to change the world.||1
2020-06-25||The Federal Reserve recently banned 34 largest banks from share buybacks in the third quarter (Q3). The Fed additionally, capped dividend payment to the second quarter (Q2) levels for these banks.

In addition to releasing the results of the 2020 bank stress test, the US central bank also released sensitivity analyses, due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) economic impact, on Thursday.

While providing a broad update of the stress test, Fed Vice Chair Randal K. Quarles said that the banking system has been a source of strength during this crisis and the results of our sensitivity analyses show that our banks can remain strong in the face of even the harshest shocks.

The Board took several actions following its stress tests to ensure large banks remain resilient despite the economic uncertainty from the coronavirus event. For the third quarter of this year, the Board is requiring large banks to preserve capital by suspending share repurchases, capping dividend payments, and allowing dividends according to a formula based on recent income. The Board is also requiring banks to re-evaluate their longer-term capital plans. All large banks will be required to resubmit and update their capital plans later this year to reflect current stresses, which will help firms re-assess their capital needs and maintain strong capital planning practices during this period of uncertainty. The Board will conduct additional analysis each quarter to determine if adjustments to this response are appropriate.

Although the announcement came after Wall Street’s close, the news might help equities to extend the recent consolidation and favor a bit to the risks. However, fears of the coronavirus (COVID-19) as harsh enough to restrict any major optimism.||0
2020-06-25||From the left: The Looming China-America Split

For years, China and the United States were in “a period of unconscious economic coupling,” but no more, observes The New York Times’ Thomas Friedman. The two are now headed for “divorce” — and China’s “overreach” is largely to blame: Under President Xi Jinping, the country has persecuted Uighurs, “aggressively” projected its power in the South China Sea, limited journalists’ rights, curtailed freedoms in Hong Kong and “hammered countries” that seek an independent inquiry into the coronavirus’ origins. The United States, meanwhile, has “underperformed,” reducing investments in infrastructure, education and “government-funded scientific research,” among other things. America and its allies now have to force Beijing to “accept new rules” on trade, COVID-19 and other issues. Alas, Beijing “respects one thing only: leverage.” And “today, we have too little and China has too much.”

Many elite journalists now argue that journalism should aim for “moral clarity” instead of “neutral objectivity” — a swap, Reason’s Matt Welch contends, that means “consciously elevating narrative ‘truths’ over verified facts.” Pulitzer Prize-winner Wesley Lowery, for one, wants journalists to “positively identify individuals and organizations as ‘racist’ ” — but how could they know? “Do ‘civil rights’ include the individual right to keep and bear arms, or to grow your own medical marijuana for personal consumption?” The new standard will let left-wing media showcase their “ideological sympathy,” inevitably leading to “journalistic sloppiness” or even “actual malfeasance.” If the journalists take “refuge in subjectivity” instead of aiming for objectivity, as media historian Tom Rosenstiel warns, “journalism will be lost.”

From the right: Trump’s Good Immigration Move

The last thing America’s pandemic-wracked economy needs is more foreign workers, argue National Review’s editors, so President Trump was right to issue a “new proclamation restricting many types of immigration through the end of the year.” Trump plainly had the requisite ­authority, since “current law gives the president incredibly broad authority to restrict immigration he deems ‘detrimental to the interests of the United States.’ ” And policy-wise, “the pandemic has temporarily changed America’s immigration needs. Seeing the jobless rate elevated throughout the economy,” the president correctly concluded that we have need of far fewer foreign workers. “If Congress doesn’t like his decision, it is free to change the law at any time.”

Back in 2017, recalls The Washington Post’s Megan McArdle, President Trump “came in for much derision” for suggesting that efforts to get rid of Confederate statues would soon lead to targeting of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Three years later, “Trump looks prescient, and his critics perhaps a touch naïve”: “The iconoclasts, having largely defeated the rebel army, are turning on the Founding Fathers.” Trump understood that “you cannot credibly declare that some revolution in social affairs,” from gay marriage to toppling statues, “has a natural stopping point unless you personally commit to stopping it when it goes too far.” Otherwise, “you will cede issue after issue to the radicals” — and “end up with something very different” from your original “idealistic vision.”

Ignore the Voice of America’s “dysfunction and criminality,” snarks Curtis Ellis at American Greatness; “the usual suspects, The New York Times and The Washington Post among them, are sounding the alarm” over President Trump’s choice to head the agency, Michael Pack, because he “is — gasp! — a conservative” with ties to Stephen Bannon. The VOA, they claim, will ­become “an arm of the Trump re-election committee.” Most “amusing” is how these “corporate media overlords” see themselves “as exemplars” of “objective reporting”: They’re basically saying if the VOA doesn’t do what they do, it’s “prima facie evidence” of interference. The truth is, given their own failure to be “reliable and authoritative” and to present a “balanced” picture, we need — “now more than ever” — an independent Voice of America, “at home as well as abroad.”||1

• Results show provided £4.4 billion in support for UK exports to 69 countries
• 77% of the companies directly supported were SMEs, 88% of which were based outside of London
• ’s new Business Plan sets out how it will increase its support to UK exporters and suppliers

UK Export Finance ( ) has today published its results for 2019 to 2020, revealing it provided £4.4 billion in support for UK exports, helping UK companies trade with 69 countries.

supported 339 companies in 2019-20, up 29% on the previous year, with a sharp increase in companies in supply chains indirectly benefiting from support. 77% of the companies supported were SMEs, and 88% of these were based outside London as the department works with companies across the UK.

Businesses that benefited from support include Environmental Street furniture, a Belfast firm selling street furniture to the Dubai Arena, Tall Group, a printing company in Runcorn selling secure high school certificates to the Kenyan National Examination Council and IQA group, a Glasgow-based utilities contractor helping Angola improve its national power supply.

In the year the UK hosted the UK-Africa Investment Summit to strengthen trade ties with the continent, has seen significant growth in its support for UK exports to Africa. provided £780 million of support to facilitate UK exports to the continent, up from £625 million last year and rising from just £85 million five years ago. This included £110 million in financing for a new maternity hospital in Ghana that will help reduce infant mortality rates in the south of the country.

Secretary of State for International Trade, Liz Truss, said:

This has been another outstanding year for UK Export Finance, helping businesses in every part of the UK win export contracts. Supporting international trade will be crucial as the UK looks to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. UK Export Finance is already playing a critical role at the centre of the government’s plan to power an export-led recovery and its offer is more important than ever for UK exporters.

has today also launched its 2020 to 2024 Business Plan which sets out how the department will meet the challenges in providing export credit and trade finance support over the next four years, particularly as the UK recovers from the impact of COVID-19.

The Business Plan outlined new objectives that will allow to adapt its support for SMEs, help businesses across all the regions of the UK access products, and focus its activity on sectors and countries where support will have the greatest economic benefit. This includes plans to further develop its support for clean growth and renewable energy business by building on the £2 billion recently allocated to ’s direct lending facility for clean growth projects.

Marcus Dolman, Co-Chairman of the British Exporters’ Association ( ) welcomed the results and said:

welcomes the positive figures announced by today, which show a marked increase in business volumes compared with previous years and we commend for their continued support of UK exporters. is a critical resource for UK exporters and their importance will be amplified this year in supporting businesses through the current crisis. We praise their enthusiasm and ingenuity in developing new products and services. We particularly look forward to the new schemes that are under development being made available to all exporters imminently and see this as a real game changer in the support of UK exports.
• ’s support is provided on a commercial basis in partnership with over 100 private sector providers and the department charges a premium to cover its costs and the risk it takes on. In 2019-20, generated more than £177 million in premium income for the Exchequer.
• This year supported its first ever offshore-wind projects in 2019-2020, enabling British companies to win contracts on the Formosa 2, Changfang and Xidao wind farms in the Taiwan Strait with more than £300 million of support.
• support in 2019-2020 extended to Jaguar Land Rover, one of the country’s major exporters. guaranteed a £500 million loan to support the company’s continued investment into research and development of its electric vehicles - the first deal for of this kind, with ’s support tied to Jaguar Land Rover’s overall working capital needs instead of a specific export contract.

2020-06-25||BuzzFeed News has reporters around the world bringing you trustworthy stories about the impact of the coronavirus. To help keep this news free, become a member .

"Everybody says, 'Oh, it's my family. I'm going to go see my brother. I’m going to see my cousin,' and they think that’s a safe word," Barbosa told BuzzFeed News.

Three have become so ill that they have been hospitalized: Barbosa's 88-year-old dad, his 86-year-old mom, and his sister, who is going through chemotherapy for breast cancer.

But after more than a dozen family members threw a surprise birthday dinner party for one of Barbosa's nieces last month, at least 18 members of the extended family have become sick with COVID-19.

Ron Barbosa's family has always been close. Members of the Dallas-area family see each other practically every day, and when the coronavirus pandemic struck, many of them thought it would be OK to continue spending time together.

While they aren't certain if the virus started spreading among the family at the May 30 party, Barbosa, 53, who did not attend the gathering, said that based on the time they started to see symptoms, it seems like the initial transmission among family members happened that weekend.

He said he believes his nephew, who hosted the party for his wife, was first exposed to the disease at work and that he had a cough on the day of the gathering.

"Next thing you know, the two nephews that basically live next door to him, they get the same cough and diarrhea, body aches, and they start getting sick," Barbosa said. "By the 6th [of June] there was a lot of symptoms. And by the 9th, people are getting really, really bad. And by the 13th, I had to take my sister and my mom to the hospital."

The rapid spread of the coronavirus among the family comes as cases explode in Texas, prompting officials there to scramble to bring things under control. As of Thursday, the state has recorded nearly 73,000 cases of COVID-19 and more than 2,200 deaths.

Due to recent increases in case numbers and hospitalizations, Gov. Greg Abbott said on Thursday the state will pause any further reopening. "The last thing we want to do as a state is go backwards and close down businesses," Abbott said in a statement. "This temporary pause will help our state corral the spread until we can safely enter the next phase of opening our state for business."

Public health experts have advised people to avoid any close contact with others outside of their immediate household, wear face coverings, and keep a safe distance from others when they leave home to protect those who are at higher risk of severe illness.

Barbosa, who is a volunteer EMT and photographer, said he and his wife, a doctor, have not been spending much time with family outside of their own household and that they wear masks and keep their distance when they do leave. But he knows not everyone in his family has been doing the same.

"The kids feel like they’re bulletproof," he said. "[They say], 'We’re safe. We’re going to keep living. We’re going to take trips, even. The airfares are down. We're blasting off!' And I said, 'You know what? If you come back and kill one of us, you’re going to feel bad' — and then it almost happened."||1
2020-06-25||California is seeing rising hospitalizations and ICU admissions in a renewed coronavirus surge, Gov. Gavin Newsom said, as other states—mostly in the South and West—see similar increases.

California reported it’s highest single-day increase of 7,149 cases on Tuesday and 5,349 cases on Wednesday. Hospitalizations have now increased by 32% while ICUs have gone up 19% over the past 14 days, Newsom said. Los Angeles County now has more cases than any other county in the U.S., but Newsom said San Bernardino, Riverside and Kings counties as well as the Bay Area are particular areas of concern. Officials say the increase may be occurring because of county-level reopenings, large gatherings and people not adhering to mask-wearing rules. California’s approach has been to let individual counties go at their own pace in reopening if they meet certain benchmarks—but Newsom said he would consider "toggling back" to stricter guidelines overruling local governments if there’s concern about capacity in the healthcare system.

The surge in cases comes a week after Newsom enacted a statewide mask order to contain further spread, especially in areas where mask wearing has become a politically charged issue. In Orange County, for example, former chief health officer Nichole Quick resigned after she was threatened by residents and questioned by the board of supervisors for supporting mandatory mask usage.

Coronavirus cases are spiking in other states too, especially those that reopened more rapidly last month, such as Florida, Nevada, Texas, Arizona and Oklahoma. Most of the new cases also seem to be impacting younger and healthier people. The renewed surge caused Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to pause on any reopening efforts on Thursday and suspend elective surgeries in four Texas counties to ensure hospital bed availability for Covid-19 patients.

Imperial County, which sits on the California/Mexico border, has 10 times more cases per 100,000 residents than the state average, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, and officials attribute the uptick to its proximity to Mexicali, a city in Mexico with a large outbreak. Large family gatherings, preexisting conditions in the population and bad air pollution may also be factors, according to the Los Angeles Times.||0
2020-06-25||There was a time in March when it felt like we were all united in attacking COVID-19, but that honeymoon was short lived. By the end of April, the virus had become partisan.

 

If you listen to some voices you would believe the coronavirus and its disastrous repercussions are the fault of one man: Roy Cooper. That’s the narrative increasingly coming from Republicans and those on the right. They ask, “Why does one man have so much power to make decisions that affect us all?” Or, “Why won’t he listen to the legislature when they dictate the opening of bars, gyms, bowling alleys and nightclubs?” They generally conclude with, “Doesn’t he know he has wrecked the economy of our state, that there are more than a million people out of work?” Those and other questions will only be intensified after the Governor’s announcement keeping Phase Two restrictions in force.

 

Democrats are equally emphatic things would not have gotten so bad had President Trump not initially refused to recognize the pandemic, been willing to develop a coherent and consistent national strategy and accepted any accountability.

 

Here’s my spin: The coronavirus doesn’t care to which political party you belong, where you live, or anything else. While it might be easy to place blame on a governor or even the president let’s put the blame where it belongs – on the virus.

 

The biggest criticism of Governor Cooper centers around his singular power in making decisions. People forget we elected him to be Governor, the chief executive officer of our state. Our Statutes grant the executive extraordinary powers during times of emergency. Governor Cooper could blunt some of the criticisms if he would tell us who he consults, give their names and say how often he does so. I could perhaps agree that the governor should consult with and seek consensus from the Council of State with two reservations. First, I have watched committees deliberate decisions and the process does not lend itself to timely and decisive action in times of crisis. At least now we have one person to hold accountable.

 

Further, I could be more supportive if there was some confidence those statewide elected officials would give nonpartisan advice. This Council of State already proved they wouldn’t do so when Republican members signed a petition attempting to force Cooper to consult with them. No Democrats signed that petition.

 

Yes, there is a statute which says the Governor should get concurrence from the Council of State in some instances, however it is so vague and poorly written that a former Supreme Court justice said a case could be made for requiring concurrence, but could just as equally support the position the governor didn’t have to do so. The legislature is attempting to change that statute but would do well to consider setting a precedent they may someday regret. One day there will be another Republican governor perhaps forced to face an unfriendly Democratic majority in the Council of State.

 

The virus doesn’t care about any of this, but we should. I hope you agree we are weary of the partisan bickering at a time when we should be uniting to fight this virus. The health of our people and our economy are more important that partisan infighting. We are better than this.||1
2020-05-28||T of Hong Kong want two things: to choose how they are governed, and to be subject to the rule of law. The Chinese Communist Party finds both ideas so frightening that many expected it to send troops to crush last year’s vast protests in Hong Kong. Instead, it bided its time. Now, with the world distracted by covid-19 and mass protests difficult because of social distancing, it has chosen a quieter way to show who’s boss. That threatens a broader reckoning with the world—and not just over Hong Kong, but also over the South China Sea and Taiwan.

On May 21st China declared, in effect, that Hong Kongers deemed to pose a threat to the party will become subject to the party’s wrath. A new security law, written in Beijing, will create still-to-be defined crimes of subversion and secession, terms used elsewhere in China to lock up dissidents, including Uighurs and Tibetans. Hong Kong will have no say in drafting the law, which will let China station its secret police there. The message is clear. Rule by fear is about to begin.

This is the most flagrant violation yet of the principle of “one country, two systems”. When the British colony was handed back to China in 1997, China agreed that Hong Kong would enjoy a “high degree of autonomy”, including impartial courts and free speech. Many Hong Kongers are outraged (see article). Some investors are scared, too. The territory’s stockmarket fell by 5.6% on May 22nd, its biggest drop in five years. Hong Kong is a global commercial hub not only because it is situated next to the Chinese mainland, but also because it enjoys the rule of law. Business disputes are settled impartially, by rules that are known in advance. If China’s unaccountable enforcers are free to impose the party’s whims in Hong Kong, it will be a less attractive place for global firms to operate.

China’s move also has implications far beyond Hong Kong. “One country, two systems” was supposed to be a model for Taiwan, a democratic island of 24m that China also sees as its own. The aim was to show that reunification with the motherland need not mean losing one’s liberty. Under President Xi Jinping, China seems to have tired of this charade. Increasingly, it is making bare-knuckle threats instead. The re-election in January of a China-sceptic Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, will have convinced China’s rulers that the chances of a peaceful reunification are vanishingly small. On May 22nd, at the opening of China’s rubber-stamp parliament, the prime minister, Li Keqiang, ominously cut the word “peaceful” from his ritual reference to reunification. China has stepped up war games around Taiwan and its nationalists have been braying online for an invasion.

China is at odds with other countries, too. In its building of island fortresses in the South China Sea, it ignores both international law and the claims of smaller neighbours. This week hundreds, perhaps thousands of Chinese troops crossed China’s disputed border with India in the Himalayas. Minor scuffles along this frontier are common, but the latest incursion came as a state-owned Chinese paper asserted new claims to land that its nuclear-armed neighbour deems Indian (see article). And, as a sombre backdrop to all this, relations with the United States are worse than they have been in decades, poisoning everything from trade and investment to scientific collaboration.

However much all the regional muscle-flexing appals the world, it makes sense to the Chinese Communist Party. In Hong Kong the party wants to stop a “colour revolution”, which it thinks could bring democrats to power there despite China’s best efforts to rig the system. If eroding Hong Kong’s freedoms causes economic damage, so be it, party bigwigs reason. The territory is still an important place for Chinese firms to raise international capital, especially since the Sino-American feud makes it harder and riskier for them to do so in New York. But Hong Kong’s is equivalent to only 3% of mainland China’s now, down from more than 18% in 1997, because the mainland’s economy has grown 15-fold since then. China’s rulers assume that multinational firms and banks will keep a base in Hong Kong, simply to be near the vast Chinese market. They are probably right.

The simple picture that President Donald Trump paints of America and China locked in confrontation suits China’s rulers well. The party thinks that the balance of power is shifting in China’s favour. Mr Trump’s insults feed Chinese nationalist anger, which the party is delighted to exploit—just as it does any tensions between America and its allies. It portrays the democracy movement in Hong Kong as an American plot. That is absurd, but it helps explain many mainlanders’ scorn for Hong Kong’s protesters.

The rest of the world should stand up to China’s bullying. On the Sino-Indian border, the two sides should talk more to avoid miscalculations, as their leaders promised to in 2018. China should realise that, if it tries the tactics it has used in the South China Sea, building structures on disputed ground and daring others to push back, it will be viewed with greater distrust by all its neighbours.

In the case of Taiwan China faces a powerful deterrent: a suggestion in American law that America might come to Taiwan’s aid were the island to be attacked. There is a growing risk that a cocksure China may decide to put that to the test. America should make clear that doing so would be extremely dangerous. America’s allies should echo that, loudly.

Hong Kong’s options are bleaker. The Hong Kong Policy Act requires America to certify annually that the territory should in trade and other matters be treated as separate from China. This week the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, declared that “facts on the ground” show Hong Kong is no longer autonomous. This allows America to slap tariffs on the territory’s exports, as it already does to those from the mainland. That is a powerful weapon, but the scope for miscalculation is vast, potentially harming Hong Kongers and driving out global firms and banks. It would be better, as the law also proposes, to impose sanctions on officials who abuse human rights in Hong Kong. Also, Britain should grant full residency rights to the hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers who hold a kind of second-class British passport—much as Ms Tsai this week opened Taiwan’s door to Hong Kong citizens. None of this will stop China from imposing its will on Hong Kong. The party’s interests always trump the people’s. ■||1
2020-05-28||Daniel Bicknell graduated in May 2020 with a Master in Public Policy degree from Harvard Kennedy School. He was a Belfer International and Global Affairs Student Fellow while at the Kennedy School. He holds an A.B. in Environmental Science and Public Policy from Harvard College and previously worked for Marstel-Day LLC, an environmental consulting firm, crafting policy and programs that balanced national security and sustainability requirements for U.S. Department of Defense clients.

Before attending HKS, Bicknell served as a Peace Corps Response volunteer in Peru, where he strengthened natural protected area co-management between Servicio Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas por el Estado (SERNANP) and indigenous community organizations. In the final year of the Obama administration, Bicknell also worked at the U.S. Department of Energy where he advanced scientific innovations through policy and partnerships.

While at HKS, Bicknell had the opportunity to take courses taught by esteemed professors such as David Keith's Policy for an Engineered Planet. In this class, he was able to learn more about the technology and policy of solar geo-engineering and its potential role in combating the climate crisis. He also researched gene drives for malaria eradication, pulling from theories and learnings from two other IGA courses: Professor Kathryn Sikkink's Global Governance and Professor Zoe Marks's Africa in Global Politics. In his final assignments, Bicknell combined the concepts he learned in each of these courses to explore gene drive accountability norms and standards, gene driving framing, and gene drive deployment decision-making processes.

Another class that stands out for Bicknell is IGA 224: Civil Resistance, in which Professor Erica Chenoweth emphasized the importance of having strategy decide campaign tactics, not the other way around. “I am grateful for having the opportunity to learn the strategy and frameworks in not only civil resistance but also in negotiations, political institutions, leadership, global governance, and sustainable development,” he says. “I have already applied new insights into the work that I am doing. Moving forward, I hope to put the work at the center and develop strategies that mobilize communities to combat the climate crisis and other social injustices.”

Bicknell also worked with Professor John Holdren and became involved in the Arctic Initiative. As part of the initiative, he served as a Course Assistant to IGA 671M: Social and Policy Innovations in the Changing Arctic. He explains that they were supposed to conduct a field experience in Greenland in collaboration with the University of Greenland. However, due to COVID-19, they switched to in-person collaboration online and conducted a virtual Greenland Policy Challenge. The program brought together 15 students from HKS and 10 students from the University of Greenland. Although the original plan had changed, Bicknell says that “the digital transition presented new opportunities to connect the global to the local (and ground Ivory Tower imaginations with experience-based knowledge), further enriching the IGA learning experience.”

After graduation, Bicknell has chosen to take advantage of a COVID-19 employment opportunity promoted through the Taubman Center for State and Local Government. “In light of the pandemic, I wanted to help the community respond to the crisis and prevent future waves of infection following graduation,” says Bicknell. “As a result, I joined Partners in Health as a Community Tracing Collaborative Contact Tracer Supervisor where I will support incredible colleagues working to keep Massachusetts residents healthy and slow the spread of COVID-19.”||2
2020-05-28||Bo Julie Crowley graduated in May 2020 with a Master in Public Policy from Harvard Kennedy School. A Belfer International and Global Affairs Student Fellow while at HKS, her research and publications focus on artificial intelligence, disinformation, and cyber security.

Before attending HKS, Crowley obtained her BA in Government from Georgetown University with concentrations in Arabic and French. Since then, she has advised Fortune 50 telecom, media, and technology clients on cybersecurity risk and strategy.

Her time at HKS has come with many special memories that she says she will cherish for years to come. One memory that stands out for her is accidentally attempting to break into the Taiwanese Legislative Yuan on a research trip with BIGA fellows Raina Davis and Casey Corcoran. She also remembers simpler moments of trying sushi from 7/11 with Davis during their semiconductor research in Tokyo.

“I am so grateful for the community of BIGA fellows and Belfer staff that shaped my past two years,” says Crowley. “I am especially proud of the field research I conducted with other BIGA classmates - thanks to the Belfer Center's support - and the papers we published on disinformation, AI, and defense technology.”

Crowley is currently working on the Defending Digital Democracy Project's Summer Training Tour for election officials across the country. Through this program, they hope to deliver a series of tailored training modules to help officials manage incident response, COVID-19, information operations, and other challenges leading up to the 2020 Presidential Election. After the summer, Crowley will join McKinsey's management consulting practice in Washington D.C. She hopes to continue her interests in national security and technology and to one day serve in government.||2
2020-05-28||Editor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter. For more stories and our pandemic tracker, see our coronavirus hub

A passed a grim milestone: 100,000 deaths from a novel coronavirus that began to spread half a year and half a world away. Many Americans think their president has handled the epidemic disastrously, that their country has been hit uniquely hard and that there is a simple causal relationship between the two. The 100,000, which does not include excess deaths mistakenly attributed to other causes, is higher than any other country’s. It has routinely been compared with the 60,000 American casualties in the Vietnam war. A Trump Death Clock in Times Square purports to show how many lives the president’s ineptitude has cost: as we went to press it stood at 60,262. Yet this widespread conviction that America has failed because of Donald Trump is not supported by the numbers. Or, at least, not yet.

The official death rate in America is about the same as in the European Union—which also has excess deaths, but has less erratic leaders and universal health care. Overall, America has fared a bit worse than Switzerland and a bit better than the Netherlands, neither of which is a failed state. New York has been hit about as hard as Lombardy in northern Italy; California acted early and is currently similar to Germany; so far, rural states have, like central Europe, been spared the worst. This reflects two things, both of which will matter now that America is reopening before it has the virus fully under control.

The first is that covid-19, when it first hit, displayed an indifference to presidents and their plans. Around the world it has killed in large, dense and connected cities like New York, London and Paris, and where people are crammed together, including care homes, slaughterhouses and prisons. In some countries, including America, testing was snarled up in red tape.

Having seen what was happening in China, Mr Trump could have acted sooner—as Taiwan, Singapore and Vietnam did. He has failed to do things ordinarily expected of an American president in a crisis, such as giving clear government advice or co-ordinating a federal response. Instead, he has touted quack remedies and spent the days when America passed its sombre milestone spreading suspicion of the voting system and accusing a television host of committing a murder that never happened. All this is reprehensible and it may have been costly. Yet, tempting as it is to conclude that the president’s failures bear most of the blame for covid-19’s spread through America, the reality is more complicated (see Briefing).

That leads to the second feature of the country’s response to covid-19. The virus was always going to be hard on a population with high levels of poverty, obesity and diseases such as diabetes, especially among minorities (see Lexington). But, to a remarkable degree, other layers of government have adapted around the hole where the president should have been. The federal system has limited the damage, thanks to its decentralised decision-making. Lockdowns vary by state, city and county. California responded as soon as it saw cases. In the north-east governors largely ignored the White House and got on with coping with the disease, earning the Republican governors of Maryland and Massachusetts the president’s enmity, but high approval ratings. In Florida, though the governor was reluctant to impose a lockdown, county officials went ahead and did so anyway.

Contrary to demands for nationwide rules, this is a strength not a weakness, and will become more so as the pandemic runs its course. In the best-organised states, which have built up testing capacity, it helps ensure that flare-ups can be spotted quickly and rules adjusted accordingly. Because each region is different, that is more efficient than a nationwide approach.

One way democracies can deal with the virus is to draw on reserves of trust. People must behave in ways that protect fellow citizens whom they have never met, even if they themselves are feeling fine. Americans trust their local officials far more than the president or the federal government. And when it comes to public health those local officials have real power. Without this balancing feature, America might today look like Brazil, where a president with a similar love of hydroxychloroquine and distaste for face masks is wreaking havoc (see article).

If the public-health response in the United States so far matches Europe’s, its economic response to the virus may turn out better. True, the unemployment rate in America is 15%, double that in the . Yet in Europe most governments are protecting jobs that may no longer exist once lockdowns end rather than focusing help on the unemployed as America’s has. The is probably delaying a painful adjustment. Congress, not known for passing consequential legislation with big bipartisan majorities, agreed on a vastly bigger fiscal stimulus than in the financial crisis a decade ago. With a Democrat in the White House and a Republican-controlled Senate, America might not have mustered a response that was either so rapid or so large.

America still has a hard road ahead. Were daily fatalities to remain at today’s level, which is being celebrated as a sign that the pandemic is waning, another 100,000 people would die by the end of the year. To prevent that, America needs to work with the system it has, trusting local politicians to balance the risks of reopening against the cost of lockdowns.

In the next months the infrastructure built during the lockdown must prove itself. Because the virus has yet to decline in some states, it may flare up in new places, which will then need targeted lockdowns. The capacity to test, vital to spotting clusters of infection, has increased, but is still lacking in some places. Almost all the states lack the contact tracers needed to work out who needs testing and quarantining. When it considers how to withdraw fiscal support, Congress should remember this.

That America and Europe have fared similarly in the pandemic does not absolve Mr Trump. This is the first international crisis since 1945 in which America has not only spurned global leadership but, by cutting funds to the World Health Organisation, actively undermined a co-ordinated international response. That matters, as does Mr Trump’s inability to cleave to a consistent message or to speak to the country in words that do not enrage half of the population. Yet four years after Mr Trump was elected, the time to be surprised by his behaviour has long gone. Luckily, he has mattered less than most Americans think.■||1

2020-09-09||Michael D'Antonio is the author of the book "Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success" and co-author, with Peter Eisner, of the upcoming book "High Crimes: The Corruption, Impunity, and Impeachment of Donald Trump." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) After Labor Day, President Donald Trump's reelection campaign will shift into high gear — but his plea for four more years is being drowned out by the outrage over charges largely confirmed by CNN that he called America's war dead "suckers" and "losers."

This, of course, is not Trump's first self-inflicted wound . It is merely the latest in a long list of scandals and revelations , which make the case that our impeached-but-not-convicted president is undeserving of reelection but also the worst president in US history.

After Trump's first term in the highest office, the US, in many ways, is unrecognizable. More than 189,000 have died of Covid-19 and the economy has collapsed. Much of the of the world now pities us for the poor leadership we must endure.

Trump has wounded the nation's psyche. He denigrates those who won't kowtow to him, including elected officials, the press and anyone who dares to challenge his actions. He does all this as he tries to claim excess power for himself. It feels to many like the US has become a nightmare. No wonder a recent Gallup poll found Americans are more politically divided than they have been in the over 80-year history of the poll.

It is audacious, of course, to suggest that someone is categorically the worst president in history, but it is no more audacious than Trump's own first-term claims to greatness, made with more than 20,000 untruths and deceptions documented in running fashion by the Washington Post. Trump is, remember, a man who said before the pandemic , "George Washington would have had a hard time beating me."

The President's most absurd claim — a main theme of his reelection campaign — is that he did everything he said he would do. His slogan , "Promises Made, Promises Kept," is another lie. Among the promises he failed to fulfill are: building a border wall that Mexico would pick up the tab for, replacing Obamacare with something better, heavily investing in rebuilding our infrastructure, reducing the federal debt, ending trade deficits and creating vast numbers of jobs. In many cases, the good things that have happened during the Trump years depended on momentum created by his predecessors.

Trump's bizarre practice of simply declaring success when failure surrounds him reached a new crescendo as he accepted his party's nomination. His speech was so riddled with distortions and lies that CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale concluded he "serially lied" throughout it. Trump placed himself beside Abraham Lincoln in the American pantheon and described his challenger in ways that should be reserved for Lucifer himself.

Among the worst acceptance speech deceptions was Trump's claim that he moved decisively to stop the pandemic. To hear Trump tell it, he is the hero in this story and the virus will soon be behind us. In fact, 3,600 people died during the four days of the convention, as colleges and universities across the country reported new outbreaks as students tried to resume on-campus studies.

Under Trump, America, a nation with just 4% of the world's population, has suffered more than 20% of those killed in the pandemic. It is true, of course, that Trump did not begin this calamity, but by many estimates, he failed egregiously in his duty to do the best anyone could do to stop it. His has been an unforgivable, unfathomable failure of leadership, with catastrophic results.

As Americans died, often at a rate of more than 1,000 per day, Trump diverted attention to quack cures and unreliable speculations. He touted one treatment — hydroxychloroquine — that was soon shown to be not just ineffective but possibly dangerous, but not before the government bought 63 million doses. Standing at the White House podium, he mused about using household cleaners and sunlight to fight the virus which, I should not have to say, are not actual treatments.

The economic impact of the pandemic has been perhaps as devastating as the misinformation. In the most recent quarter, the US economy shrank by an estimated 32.9%, which was the worst fall ever recorded . (Yes, a worse economic contraction than any quarter of the Great Depression). Unemployment, which is a better measure of individuals' suffering, has also reached a record , bring with it all the anxiety that comes with the sudden loss of work and bill-paying security.

Of course, America has faced terrible times before. But when those crises brought death and suffering due to war, we could take comfort that some noble cause was part of the equation. In this case, nothing noble will be achieved by all this sacrifice. What about the pandemic of 1918? Yes, that outbreak did kill more Americans, but it occurred when scientists knew less about contagions and much less could be done for the sick. Trump, in contrast, had the public health resources of the richest country on earth at his disposal. Not only did he fail to use them, he actually attacked the experts at these agencies for trying to do their jobs.

Rick Bright, the federal doctor formerly overseeing Covid-19 vaccine development, said that he was pulled from that role after clashing with the administration's stance on hydroxychloroquine. The Centers for Disease Control was apparently under pressure by the President's team to change its guidelines for schools. Some at the CDC who once talked freely to reporters to help the American people understand threats to their well-being have withdrawn for fear of reprisals.

No one has been more mistreated by Trump than the nation's top expert on contagious disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, whom Trump has called "alarmist" and a man who "made a lot of mistakes" as an adviser on the crisis. It could be easily argued that no one in the world is more respected than Fauci when it comes to the science of pandemics, and yet Trump and his closest lieutenants have repeatedly undermined him. Trade adviser Peter Navarro even published an op-ed declaring , "Anthony Fauci has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on."

Perhaps the damage of the Trump era that will leave the longest-lasting mark is the political and social tumult he has fostered apart from the pandemic. Trump has used his pardon power to reward his cronies, stonewalled Congress as it sought to perform its oversight duties and crusaded against a press that he calls the "enemy the people." He turned federal officers on peaceful protesters and exaggerated unrest in big cities to demonize those exercising their right to demonstrate. With Election Day approaching, he has repeatedly predicted that fraud and chaos will accompany the vote.

It becomes an afterthought when compared to everything else, but let's not forget that Trump was only the third president to be impeached by the House of Representatives. It is difficult to name a president who has shown so little concern for so many of the people he is supposed to serve. This terrible quality was likely on the minds of the 157 presidential scholars who responded to a rank-the-presidents survey conducted in 2018 by Siena College. At that time Trump placed third from last, just ahead of Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan. Of course, this survey was completed before the pandemic, the recession that followed, and Trump's impeachment.

Coming out of the Republican convention, Trump signaled that we will get more of the same from him between now and November 3. He practiced his signature name-calling against the mayor of Portland, Oregon, resumed undermining the use of masks to protect public health, and demonstrated his contempt for mail-in voting by suggesting people vote twice — of course this is against the law — because the system may not work.||1

2020-05-28||Japan, which unveiled a trillion-dollar stimulus to revive its Covid-19 and lockdown-hit economy in April, is reported to be planning another trillion-dollar stimulus. The new package includes direct subsidies for companies to help them cover cost of operations, health care aid for individuals, and financial assistance for local governments. The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said the total of the two packages will work out to around 40% of the country’s GDP. The fiscal cost of the package isn’t clear. HT’s analysis estimated that of the previous trillion-dollar package at around $454 billion or 9.13% of the country’s GDP.

The European Commission has also said it is working on a package of between €750 billion ($823 billion) and €1 trillion ($1.97 trillion) for the region, including a proposed 500 billion euro ($548 billion) fund that can be tapped by member-countries whose economies have been hit hard by the coronavirus disease pandemic.

The US Heroes Act, which promises $3 trillion in support, including another round of cheque payments to eligible Americans, is unlikely to be passed by the Senate, but there is talk that there will be a follow-up to the $2 trillion package announced in the CARES Act. Including monetary measures, HT’s Analysis calculates that the US has announced a total package of $6.8 trillion of which the fiscal cost is around $940 billion (this is a very conservative estimate and excludes loans and guarantees).

The consensus estimate for the fiscal cost of India’s $277 billion package is around $29 billion.

Plans for a second stimulus package underline a realisation in countries around the world that the impact of the pandemic and the lockdowns enforced by many countries to slow its spread – in the absence of a cure, a lockdown is the only way to break the chain of infections – will be harder than originally estimated. According to a Reuters poll of economists released on Wednesday, the global economy will shrink by 3.2% this year. A similar poll last month predicted that the decline would be 2%. The International Monetary Fund said in April that global growth would decline by 3% in 2020, and its managing director Kristalina Georgieva recently hinted that this could be revised down. But while this year will be worse than estimated, the economists polled by Reuters expect next year to be better. The poll said global growth could bounce back to 5.4% next year, up from the 4.5% predicted in April’s poll, although this is largely the base effect shining through.

In India too, the immediate impact on the economy is likely to be harder than expected. State Bank of India said in a research note on Tuesday that India’s GDP could contract 40% in the first three months of the year (April-June) and by 6.8% in the full year (2020-21). But it expects growth to bounce back once the country opens fully. Rating agency Crisil, which sees the country’s economy shrinking 5% in 2020-21, expects the first quarter to see a 25% fall in GDP.

Much depends on when the country reopens fully. And much also depends on when India starts flattening the curve – in terms of new cases of Covid-19, and in terms of daily deaths. Neither is happening right now: both the number of new cases and that of daily deaths are continuing to rise. And at some point in the next few months, India is going to have to start thinking in terms of a new package that can revive demand, put more money in the hands of individuals, and financially support businesses. It’s probably too early to talk of it – the ink on the documentation of the first package is yet to dry and many of the notifications related to it are yet to be issued – but developments in the US, Japan, and Europe clearly indicate that the economy needs more.||0
2020-05-28||High levels of economic activity can foster the spread of communicable diseases through frequent person-to-person interactions. This column discusses how research on high levels of employment affects the spread of influenza and other viruses transmitted via droplet-spread, such as SARS-CoV-2. The results show that the high levels of employment in the US encourages the spread of influenza, especially when employment in service sectors are high. Our results provide support for social distancing measures aimed to slow the growth of cases of COVID-19.

Many of the characteristics or environments associated with modern daily work life may encourage the transmission of viruses, including seasonal influenza (the flu) and the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of Covid-19. These characteristics include commuting via public transportation, working in climate controlled indoor offices, sharing workspaces, and placing young children in daycare. If the features of the working environment promote the spread of the flu and other viruses, then being out of the labour force and away from these environments could help reduce the spread of diseases. This is the premise behind the current public health policies of closing down public places and requiring social distancing.

Early evidence suggests that these social distancing measures may be reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. Dave et al. 2020, Friedson et al. 2020, Courtemanche et al. 2020, Baldwin and Weder di Mauro 2020). However, because the COVID-19 pandemic is so recent, much of this evidence is based on only a few months of data. More evidence surrounding the effects of social distancing on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 could be gathered by studying the spread of similar viruses, namely the flu.

Evidence that high levels of employment are associated with high rates of seasonal flu

In a recently published article (Markowitz et al. 2019), we examine the relationship between economic activity, as measured by employment levels, and the spread of the flu in the US. We use state-level monthly employment rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and state-level monthly estimates of flu activity from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, spanning the 2010-2011 flu season up to the 2016-2017 flu season.

Our basic empirical strategy is to predict flu activity in a state and month as a function of the state’s employment levels in the previous month, as well as temperature and precipitation, and the previous month’s flu rate.

If our hypothesis is correct, we should expect that increases in employment in jobs with higher levels of interpersonal contact should be more related to the spread of the flu. Thus, we construct a measure of interpersonal contact levels for each industry sector using data from O*Net and construct employment measures at the industry level using data from the BLS Current Employment Statistics (CES) data set. We find that the two sectors with the highest levels of interpersonal contact are the retail and healthcare sectors, while the sectors with the lowest level of interpersonal contact are the construction and manufacturing sectors.

Figure 1 summarise the results from our regression models. We plot the increases in flu prevalence from an average monthly increase in overall employment and employment in sectors with high and low measures of interpersonal contact.

We find a strong positive association between employment and the spread of the flu, and the results suggest that an average monthly change in overall employment (about 0.33 percentage points) increases flu prevalence by about 6%. We find that employment changes in the retail and healthcare sectors, the two sectors with the highest levels of interpersonal contact, drive the aggregate results. The same average monthly increase in retail employment and healthcare employment would lead to much larger expected increases in flu prevalence of between 20% and 30%, respectively. Moreover, we find that employment changes in the construction sector, one of the sectors with the lowest level of interpersonal contact, is not associated with statistically significant changes in flu prevalence. Interestingly, changes in manufacturing employment lead to a large, but extremely imprecisely measured, increase in flu prevalence. This may be due to underlying heterogeneity in how different types of manufacturing employment either aid or are not related to the spread of the flu. We believe this remains an interesting question for future research.

Figure 1 Percent changes in flu prevalence from an average monthly increase in employment

These results are relevant for several reasons. First, barring major economic shocks, employment conditions can be forecast, to a fairly accurate degree, several months in advance. This information could be used by the public health community to plan for the severity of an upcoming flu season. For example, the 2017-2018 flu season was particularly severe. Hospitals found themselves unprepared and struggling to keep up with the influx of patients. As we have recently learned, the ability to predict the potential severity of future communicable diseases is vital information for hospitals and public health officials. In general, if the economy is on an upswing, the public health community should plan for an above normal increase in such diseases. The reverse will hold as well. This same logic can reasonably be applied to other droplet-spread, respiratory diseases, like COVID-19.

Furthermore, our results imply that employment in service industries – particularly retail and healthcare – is a particularly strong mechanism for flu spread. If our economy continues to shift to more service-oriented employment, the results presented here suggest there is greater potential for virus spread in the future. The statistically insignificant findings for industries such as construction with relatively low levels of interpersonal contact support the continuation of construction and infrastructure projects during periods of social distancing. Likewise, restrictions on retail business and non-essential medical visits are prudent considerations, as our results suggest activity in these industries is a significant source of viral infection. Lastly, employers should consider differences in the lost productivity from many employees becoming infected with viruses versus the lost productivity from a few infected individuals taking sick leave. Workers concerned about missing pay or losing their jobs as the result of staying home from work due to illness will be less likely to heed early signs of influenza or other viral infections and stay home. Since a person may be infectious while experiencing mild symptoms, this greatly increases the probability that the virus will spread to other workers in the firm. This implies that firms should consider more generous ‘sick day’ policies, particularly during the flu season. A recent working paper (Pichler et al. 2020) and a corresponding VoxEU column (Pichler and Ziebarth 2020), provide direct evidence of this hypothesis using variation in state-level mandated sick leave policies.

In this instalment of our series Dear Diary: In a Time of COVID-19, Sima Chowdhury tells us about fighting to see her mother in hospital, who ultimately made the decision she would be better off at home. This submission has been edited for clarity and length.

Hospitalized in Lethbridge with complications from pulmonary fibrosis during COVID-19, my mother had an isolation room containing a separate section for staff to don and doff personal protective equipment, a private bathroom, a television and beautiful natural light.

A room fit for a queen, as her attending physician affectionately called her. We were only allowed to see her in the room for ourselves when he didn't think she would survive the latest ordeal. During my visiting shift, she insisted on a selfie of us. Sharing the photo with my friends, they understood the seriousness of the situation.

With a strong will to live, my mother recovered enough to lose her ability to hold court with us in her hospital kingdom. Two of her favourite subjects were absent from these audiences.

My two nephews were too young to see her and expressed their frustration at COVID-19 for robbing them of the opportunity to see their grandmother for what could have been the last time. Despite her doctor's misgivings of an early release, "The Queen" decided to come home to see her grandchildren.

Meeting her needs at home requires a team effort. My sister and I drive from Calgary to ease the burden on our father, while nurses visit regularly to administer intravenous medications.
• Dear Diary: Driveway visits are nice, but this grandmother just wants a hug
• Dear Diary: An ER doctor opens up on what keeps him coming to work each day

My heart goes out to anyone who has to fight to see loved ones sick in the hospital. Healing comes in many forms, not just in medicines and vaccines, but in kindness, love, and hope from familiar faces.

The attending physician told my mom that having her family around aided her recovery. She went a step further to make sure she had access to us, whether or not her choice was medically approved.

Our health system needs to support a holistic approach for the vulnerable rather than wage germ warfare on those least able to advocate for themselves.

2020-05-28||Gentry County has gone from three COVID-19 cases a week ago to now having 21 active cases as of Wednesday along with reporting its first COVID-19 death.

Officials with the Tri-County Health Department said a woman in her 90s died from COVID-19 this week.

The county now has what Tri-County Health Department officials described as a “cluster” of cases. Those officials declined to identify Wednesday where the cluster was centered, and staff at a facility cited on social media as one location with a number of cases also would not comment on the situation there.

Tri-County Health Department officials said the all active cases in Gentry County are resulting in mild symptoms and added they have performed contact tracing for those who have tested positive in the jump of new cases.

Lilli Parsons, director in Stanberry for the Tri-County Health Department, said staff have been informing citizens about social distancing through their Facebook page.

“We try to educate people all the time on the proper things to do and encourage people all the time on the proper things to do and to encourage people to stay at home and not gather, but sometimes it doesn’t go over very good,” Parsons said.

Parsons said she hopes the jump of numbers within the rural community will reinforce the need for people to be serious and cautious about what they are doing in regards to social distancing.||1

Has Covid accelerated the future of work? This column argues that Covid has changed the future of work via four shocks: massive job losses, massive digital transformations, massive debt burdens, and massive costs of socially distanced office space. These matter in two ways. First, due to sunk cost hysteresis, re-hiring workers is very different than retaining workers. Second, the digital transformations, office-space costs, and debt burdens will push firms to replace domestic workers with ‘telemigrants’ or ‘white-collar robots’. The jobs that return will be those that require face-to-face interactions and involve tasks that AI cannot handle.

Things have changed so much with Covid-19 that not even the future is what it used to be – or so it seems from all the predictions that analysts are making about the post-Covid world. But why should things change permanently? Things are the way they are for good reasons. If the reasons don’t change permanently, the outcomes won’t change permanently.

Actually, it is more complicated than that. Some socio-economic-political outcomes are governed by what might be called ‘rubber-band dynamics’, others by ‘paper-clip dynamics.’
• When you shock a rubber band – say, pull on it – the shape deforms, but the shape returns when you stop pulling. Temporary shocks have temporary effects.

Most economic phenomena are like this – the standard supply-and-demand mechanism, for instance.
• When you pull on a paper clip, it deforms but the shape doesn’t return when you stop pulling. Temporary shocks have permanent effects.

Technically, the two types of dynamics are called non-hysteretic (rubber band) and hysteretic (paper clip).

When thinking about how the Covid shock will change the future, we must focus on hysteretic processes. Generally speaking, hysteresis happens in systems where the level of some capital stock alters marginal costs or benefits. Here ‘capital’ includes simple versions like human, physical, and knowledge capital, or more complex forms like organisational capital, social trust, aspirations, and expectations. Different sources of hysteresis work with different types of shocks.

Covid-19 has profoundly shocked the economy in many ways. Four are particularly pertinent to the future of work.
• An epic number of people have lost their jobs.

In America the figure is almost 40 million. In Europe, fewer have been laid off, but millions have been dislodged from their usual employment relationships (Boeri et al 2020). Many of these separations will last for a few quarters at least.

This matters. Due to sunk costs, a firm’s decision to hire a worker is very different than its decision to retain a worker, and that’s why employment is a hysteretic process. The firings also matter since they boost the attractiveness of office-place automation – what I call ‘white collar robots’ in my 2019 book, The Globotics Upheaval. Automating service-tasks with, for example, robotic process automation (RPA) systems, chatbots, virtual assistants, or higher-end AI-systems is easier when you’ve already laid off the workers they are replacing.
• A large share of workers in Europe and America have learned to work remotely.

Estimates are that from 40-70% of workers in the US and Europe worked from home due to the pandemic (Berg et al 2020, Dingel and Nieman 2020, Brehan 2020). To make this possible, firms have invested in digital transformations – especially in the service sector. Companies have invested in hardware and bandwidth. Workers have learned how to use collaborative software, access remote databases, and participate in virtual meetings. Managers have learned how to manage virtual teams.

This matters since the human, physical, and organisational investments are not going away. And anything that makes it easier to telework domestically also makes it easier to telework internationally (what I called ‘telemigration’ in my book).

Now that telework is feasible for a hefty slice of their workforce, firms will soon realise that they can get some of the remote work done at much lower cost by hiring workers sitting in low-wage countries. While it is certainly true that foreign talent working online is unlikely to be as good as domestic talent working in the office, the foreign talent may be a whole lot cheaper. This is just service-sector globalisation, so the deeper point is Covid-linked changes are lowering the technical barriers to this type of globalisation.
• Office space in Europe and America got more expensive due to social distancing and other anti-contagion requirements.

This won’t last forever, but it is likely to be true during much of the recovery phase.

This matters since firms will face the cost-raising aspects while they are deciding whether to rehire workers in-house, to sink the costs of outsourcing the jobs (domestically or internationally), or to automate the positions using white-collar robots.
• Corporate and government balance sheets have already been hit hard by the Covid concussion; more red ink is predicted for many quarters to come.

This matters since firms will be under pressure to cut costs in the short and medium term. Using ‘remote intelligence’ (RI) like telemigrants and artificial intelligence (AI) like white-collar robots will be one way of reducing expenses.

The post-Covid employment landscape: What can’t RI and AI do?

As the world returns to normal, private and public employers will have to decide which sorts of workers they want, and how many of them – starting from something of a tabula rasa. Some may decide to just go back to doing things the old way. But on the margin, the investment in remote work capacity will surely result in fewer workers in offices.

So, what jobs won’t be replaced by RI or AI? Applying the logic I developed in The Globotics Upheaval, the jobs that will return are those that are intensive in the sorts of tasks that (1) can’t be done remotely, and (2) can’t be done by white-collar robots. In other words, the way to think about the future of work post-Coivd-19 is to use a process of elimination. The question then is: What can’t RI and AI do? I have a couple of chapters on this in my book, but here’s the gist.

As it turns out, humans have unique advantages over white-collar robots in things like judgement, empathy, intuition, creativity, ethics, curiosity, and comprehension of complex interactions among teams of humans. Psychologist call this ‘social cognition’ and we have it for very specific, very deep-seated reasons. Michael Tomasello’s book, The Cultural Origin of Human Cognition, asserts that social cognition allowed humans to live in large groups where survival turned on the ability of individuals to cooperate in a complex web of relationships involving trust, kinship, and dominance. The equipment for this is hardwired into the human brain.

Machine learning has problems with social cognition, as I point out at length in my book. First, even today’s computers aren’t powerful enough given the combinatoric aspects of social interactions. Second, we don’t have the right kind of data to train the white-collar robots. Third, machine learning techniques are a shallow imitation of the biology of human learning, so it may be that a whole new computer-science approach is needed if machines are to rival humans in the most human skills (Lake et al. 2017).

What kind of jobs can’t be done by telemigrants? Clearly, work that requires local or culture-specific knowledge will be hard to do from overseas. More generally, the key is to think hard about why face-to-face communication matters. Since verbal communication is almost costless these days, a good place to start is nonverbal communication – a topic that is widely studied by psychologists.

When people are face-to-face in the same room, psychological experiments suggest that less than 30% of the information exchanged stems from the words spoken – some communication researchers put the number as low as 7%. The rest is nonverbal. One clear upshot of this is that forming trust is much easier with face-to-face communication since it is easier to lie with words than it is to lie face-to-face. This is exactly why we trust people more when they say things straight to our face.

Almost ten years ago, Alan Blinder classified jobs according to offshore-ability, finding that something like 40% could be done remotely. The sectors where less than 20% of the jobs were offshorable – that is, could be done by telemigrants – were mostly of the have-to-be-there type: jobs in hotels and restaurants, transportation and warehousing, construction, leisure industries, education, and health and social care. The most vulnerable sectors to telemigrants were professional, scientific and technical sectors, and the finance, industry, and media sectors. More recently, Dingel and Neiman (2020) came up with the figure that 37% of US jobs could be done remotely.

Most service-sector and professional jobs have been sheltered from globalisation (i.e. remote intelligence) and white-collar robots (i.e. artificial intelligence) since face-to-face interactions were important and computers couldn’t think. That has been changing progressively as digital technology has advanced.

Pushed by Covid-19, firms and workers have invested in, say, ten years’ worth of digital transformation in just a few months. My guess is that this will accelerate the trend towards more service sector jobs coming into competition with ‘globotics’, i.e. telemigrants working in our offices while sitting abroad (the globalisation part), and software robots replacing particular office-tasks (the robotics part). The jobs that survive competition from telemigrants will be those that require face-to-face interactions. The jobs that survive competition from white-collar robots will be those that stress humanity’s great advantages.

2020-05-29||Strikers gathered in Aotea Square for a rally and march down Queen Street Auckland as a call for action on climate change.

Auckland Council proposes major cuts across the board including to climate change action, scaling back services, jobs, and access to some facilities in the face of a $525 million budget hit due to Covid-19.

Few areas of the council operations are spared with proposed cuts to some public transport services, the electrification of the bus fleet, and community spending as the council faces going into deficit for the first time in its 10-year history.

In a second three-week round of public consultation on the hastily re-shaped budget, the council said cuts would be deeper if Aucklanders opted for the lower-than-planned option of a 2.5 per cent rate rise.

The council said operating costs would have to be cut by a further $54 million under a 3.5 per cent rates rise or by $75 million under the lower 2.5 per cent option.

"Both packages will result in noticeable changes to what we are providing to the community and to the level of staff we employ," it said in the public consultation document just released.

Other moves to keep the books as close to balanced as possible, include the sale of $200 million of unspecified assets, likely to be non-strategic or surplus property.

The council said it was juggling the need to cut spending, with unexpected costs it will face.

"A current example is the drought situation, for which Watercare may need to soon invest $50 million to $180 million in critical water supply infrastructure," it said.

Transport-related revenue is expected to be down by $113 million, and part of the gap could be closed by a 4 per cent public transport fare rise in February, one of the biggest-ever by Auckland Transport.

There will be $37 million transport operating budget cut across staffing, contractors, and cuts to the frequency and level of some services.

Unusually, an often-suggested move, charging for some park and ride car parks, would occur only if a lower, 2.5 per cent rate rise was implemented.

Transport spending being cut or put back includes road safety improvements, red-light camera roll-outs at intersections, and all cycling and walking projects not yet in construction.

The already-criticised slow roll out of electric buses will be further delayed, with only three to be added on the Puhinui-Airport route this year.

A post Covid-19 construction slowdown is expected to show up as a 25 per cent - 35 per cent reduction in the number of building and resource consents, resulting in a $50 million drop in revenue.

Cuts in staff numbers and costs, and internal efficiencies in the Environmental Services, Waste Services and Regulatory Services departments is expected to save $3.43 million.

Staff cuts and other savings in the Parks and Community area is due to save $6.49 million.

Mayor Phil Goff said none of the proposed budget cuts were easy to make.

"There was nothing in the budget before Covid-19 that was frivolous or superfluous, so everything that has been cut was important," he told Stuff.

The development agency Panuku would have to cut its running costs by $3 million, and slowing down city centre and local centre developments would save $2.4 million.

Big cuts include deferring $162 million of capital works in the water and wastewater area.

Most upgrades and replacements of community buildings and playgrounds is frozen, and under a 2.5 per cent rate rise scenario, some lesser-used facilities would close permanently.

There will be fewer and smaller council-backed events such as Matariki, Waitangi Ki Manukau, Movies in Parks, Music in Parks, and the Heritage Festival.

Goff held out hope that some funding may flow from the Government's various Covid-19 responses, such as helping to fund "shovel ready" projects, but that was still unknown.

"I can't say that anything we are having to defer for a year, is something we did not need," he said.

Despite the cuts, the council was still proposing capital expenditure of $2.3 billion, while lower than the previously planned $2.7b, it was far higher than the five-year average of $1.6b.

Aucklanders have until Friday June 19 to have their say on the reduced council budget.||0
2020-05-29||The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has said it will not increase the daily expenses allowance for asylum seekers following a request for the weekly payment to be temporarily increased by €20 during the Covid-19 pandemic.

More than 40 organisations, legal professionals and academics working with asylum seekers in Ireland wrote to the Minister for Employment and Social protection Regina Doherty in early May asking for additional financial support for people in direct provision during the health crisis.

The group expressed concern that people seeking protection were not entitled to the State’s short term Covid-19 financial support and that they remained “exceptionally vulnerable” during the crisis.

Many asylum seekers are facing additional costs including increased spending on children who would normally be at school, cleaning items, medicine and food, said the letter to the minister. Many direct provision residents who would usually use free Wi-Fi in libraries, are spending more money on mobile data to access public health guidance online, it added.

The letter also urged the department to reconsider its decision not to make the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) available to people in direct provision.

While some asylum seekers who lost work because of the coronavirus initially received the State support measure, payments to people living in direct provision stopped after a couple of weeks and residents were put back on the €38.80 weekly allowance (€155.20 per month) for adults in the asylum system. Children in direct provision receive €29.80 each week.

In a letter dated May 15th and seen by The Irish Times, Ms Doherty responded that there were no plans to reinstate the Covid-19 payment to asylum seekers in direct provision who had lost work.

Any increases to the rate of the daily expenses allowance would have to be approved by Government and “considered in a budgetary context”, she said.

Protection applicants living in direct provision receive food, accommodation and other services as well as the weekly allowance while the PUP is paid to “people, who in most cases, have no other source of income”, said Ms Doherty in the letter.

Asylum seekers living outside direct provision are eligible for PUP, she added.

The minister noted that under measures introduced in response to the pandemic, asylum seekers could stay with friends or family on a temporary basis while retaining their place within the accommodation system and continuing to receive the weekly stipend.

Asylum seekers can also access exceptional needs payments, with payments made at the discretion of officers administering the scheme, she said. Any asylum seeker who requires financial assistance should contact the community welfare service that deals with their accommodation centre, added the minister.

Irish Refugee Council director Nick Henderson said he was disappointed by the minister’s response and that the group would continue to campaign for the increased financial support.

An additional €20 per week would enable direct provision residents to buy extra hand sanitiser, face masks, phone data or home schooling tools, said Mr Henderson. “Rejecting this request on the grounds that it is a budgetary matter and would need to be approved by Government ignores the seismic changes that have already been made to this year’s budget,” he said. “Increasing the allowance by this amount would go some way in showing we truly are all in this together.”||1
2020-05-29||I suspect many teachers are recoiling from the phrase “the new normal”. There is nothing normal about remote teaching and the idea that it can become a long-term replacement for the classroom or lecture hall is anathema to most in education. Also worrying is the possibility that those in charge of third-education institutions, even more starved of resources than they were before Covid-19, will see remote or “blended” teaching as a new, cheaper, streamlined way of delivering “output”, rendering the university campus almost redundant.

Arising out of the current crisis, there is a danger of a whole new language around online educational “provision” being added to the layer of corporate management speak that has long pervaded the Irish education system. In 2015, a senior UCD administrator sent this message to the university staff: “Strategic Initiative 6 is concerned with consolidating and supporting efforts across our community to enhance agility and effectiveness in university process improvement, thereby continuously furthering value for the UCD community and process beneficiaries whilst simultaneously empowering faculty and staff to proactively engage in continuous process improvement initiatives”.

Those with a high pain threshold can reread that “sentence” several times, but it will remain what it is: a grotesque subversion of the notion of a third-level community. This jargon is a product of a trend historian Tom Dunne had written about two years earlier: “like a deadly, odourless gas, the elements of a quiet revolution have seeped through every area of Irish education during recent years, poisoning the atmosphere . . . a relentless application of market principles . . . has shifted the focus of education from the development of the individual and the benefits flowing from this to society to the service of the economy, narrowly conceived”.

This took on added pace in the aftermath of the last economic collapse with an insistence that “applied research” needed to be the main priority. Teachers were increasingly seen as “service providers”, the students as “service users” and the university leaders and reams of bureaucrats as “managers”. The casualisation of academic labour and short-term contracts further embedded an insecurity that is the antithesis of an academic “community” and hinders creativity. There has also been a preoccupation with what is offensively labelled “performance for growth” by university management as if the educators were stocks and shares. Parallel to this are obsessions with “impact”, “globalisation” and ensuring a flow of money from China. Recently, UCD management sought to change the university’s policy on academic freedom to allow for “different interpretations” of the concept due to its links with China, the idea being that if UCD continues to “strengthen its international engagement” and partnerships with other universities overseas, it should seek to accommodate “divergent approaches to academic freedom”. After a backlash, the proposed changes were withdrawn.

When I was an undergraduate, the president of UCD was a philosopher. The chances of such an appointment today are negligible. How old-fashioned it appears now to strive for a university that is a pleasant place in which to work and study, with pride in its self-made identity and producing independent thinkers who can conserve, create and transmit knowledge.

There is an onus on those in humanities – as in other areas – to effectively communicate the public value of their research; the university is supposed to be a public good and those in it have responsibilities as public servants. But so do those administering education and now is the time to think about that.

From mid-March, educators responded to an emergency as best they could by switching everything online to get the academic year over the line. And that seemed to be the overwhelming priority; in the same way, the discourse about this year’s Leaving Cert students seemed to be solely about the exams and what course place might come after, relegating discussion of the problems in the system as it stands, with or without Covid-19. A Higher Education Authority Report of 2018 highlighted that one in six third-level students drops out of their course during their first year, and as pointed out by Brian Mooney this week, that figure is likely to increase due to the panic and uncertainty prevalent this year for those hoping to go on to third level. An acceptance, or worse still, embracing of remote teaching as the norm can only exacerbate that problem; students need to learn and thrive through direct engagement not only with their course material but also with their lecturers and fellow students.

It is not more technology and regularising of remoteness that is needed coming out of this crisis. It is imperative that our universities are properly funded, but we do not need a new obsession with what I saw this week described as “crisis-driven innovation; adaptation through technology”. The danger is that this will further entrench the notion of “delivering” rather than teaching.||1
2020-05-29||I am a postdoctoral researcher studying retinal diseases and was recently awarded a career transition grant to start my own lab. My search for a faculty position was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. I started sending out applications in January 2020, and found out in March that my planned interviews across several US states coincided with campus closures. The interviews were postponed indefinitely.

I reached out to four potential employers, and we agreed to conduct online interviews. Conducting a full-day interview online was new both to me and to the interviewers, but over the past eight weeks, I’ve got lots of hands-on experience. Here’s what I learnt.

Coronavirus and COVID-19: Keep up to date

Ask for an itinerary. Just as with an in-person interview, it’s important to have a sense of what your day is going to look like. I made sure I knew who I would be meeting and what they were planning to go over. Your potential employer will probably send a series of links to connect to the scheduled meetings.

I made sure I had room in my itinerary to disconnect, reconnect and troubleshoot technical glitches between meetings. I also scheduled breaks throughout the day, and a long break for lunch to mentally disengage and stretch out. In practice, this meant I had 5 minutes between every ‘back-to-back’ meeting, plus 15-minute breaks every couple of hours, and an hour for lunch.

Test the connection. Before the interviews, I asked my potential employers what videoconferencing tool they were using, and downloaded the program to my computer (often there is a web version but, in my experience, the downloadable app tends to be more stable and come with more options). I familiarized myself with it by setting up a call with a friend so I could explore the program’s features and get input. I also asked the meeting administrator for a test session a few days before the actual interview to make sure I could share my audio, video and seminar slides properly.

Set up your meeting room. I was going to be sitting in the same spot for the whole interview, so I made sure to choose a quiet, well-lit room.

As lockdowns ease, you might be able to conduct the interview from your lab, but if you are still at home, ask those you live with to be quiet and respect your space for the day. If you go into the office or are in a shared living space, put a sign on the doorknob making it clear that you shouldn’t be disturbed. If you have children or pets that might make noise, let your interviewers know ahead of time. Try not to let it worry you — we’re all getting used to background noises under lockdown and your interviewers are not going to judge you on your children’s ability to keep quiet. In my case, I headed into my lab, following social- distancing guidelines, and informed my colleagues of the interview beforehand.

Prepare your environment. I was careful to adjust the camera to be at my eye level. Some meeting programs provide a virtual background or let you upload one from your desktop, but I used the neutral wall in my lab because it felt more natural. I also chose to face the door to anticipate any surprise entrances. Make sure you have what you need next to you, such as your itinerary, a pen and paper, and your CV.

Embrace Murphy’s law: ‘Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong.’ In my case, it was the Wi-Fi signal. Halfway into a seminar, I had to move to another room to find an ethernet cable and continue my presentation. It was disruptive, but I hope the interviewers took it as a sign of resilience and working through unusual circumstances. If it’s an option, a back-up technical plan and computer is a good idea.

Dress up. In an online interview, you do not have personal interaction, and therefore you want to give the best impression possible through your tiny computer camera. I made sure I dressed as if I was going to meet my prospective employer in person. Professional attire has a positive impact and helped to remind me to behave in a polished manner — I’ve found it too easy to drop the professionalism in front of a webcam, because you don’t feel the same social pressure you might in a face-to-face interview. Dress well from top to bottom and do not rely on the fact that the camera shows only your upper body. You might need to stand up or walk with your laptop from one room to another, as I did.

Communicate clearly. When I faced connection problems during my conversations and seminar, I tried to explain in a calm and timely manner. I had a mobile phone on hand, and had exchanged numbers with the meeting administrator in case I needed to troubleshoot problems. I tried to pause at appropriate points during my seminar, to make sure everyone was following and connected. In one of the sessions, I was talking to two faculty members who could see me and each other, but I could not see them owing to a software glitch. I made sure to check they were still available, and let them know that I could only hear them. There were other clumsy moments — often it felt like a choice between interrupting an interviewer or letting dead silence fill the air for a moment. In these moments, I made sure to keep a big smile on my face and talked only after the other side had completely finished and paused for couple of seconds.

Before I accept a job offer, I hope I will eventually be able to visit the facilities and lab space in-person — an important consideration that can’t be solved by videoconferencing. But overall, I found online interviewing much less tiring and stressful than onsite visits. I had many more opportunities to rest outside individual meetings, which I wouldn’t have had in the ‘real world’. And I had none of the travel commitments that might have been burdensome before lockdown.

Be prepared to be told that your potential employer will not be hiring until COVID-19 loosens its grip. Be patient, positive and understanding. Remember that this is a difficult time for everyone — and your potential employers will probably do the same for you.||2

2020-05-30||OPINION: The scale and pace of change today is extraordinary. For years companies have been preparing for forces of disruption such as shifting regulations, digitisation, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI), but the sudden impact of Covid-19, a single force, caught the world off guard.

When a fundamental challenge for companies is to predict when and where disruption is coming from, Covid-19 arrived and managed to disrupt business models, air travel, supply chains and work-life balance around the world in less time than it takes to complete a 30-day fitness challenge.

No-one knows exactly what lasting impact Covid-19 will have on the economy and supply chains, amongst other things, but we are already seeing and living the societal changes that will undeniably have lasting impacts. Whether it’s moving more of our lives online, new hygiene habits, greater comfort with absenteeism, a revived gratitude for the great outdoors, a new form of nationalism as we hail our essential workers or simply a re-kindled appreciation for plunger coffee, the novel virus is already reorienting our relationship to the outside world and each other.

How quickly the new habits and awareness will recede (if ever) as the lockdown eases is uncertain and it will be different for different people, but we need to acknowledge that many things that were once ignored have been overturned by necessity, so we are destined for some permanent change.

 * Build with wood – a boon for jobs and the environment



Amid all this change and uncertainty, how can organisations best understand the new way of being-in-the-world and doing-in-the-world to achieve lasting impact?

There are a myriad of perceptions floating around about the future of physical workspaces and business models as a result of the lockdown and working from home (WFH). While it’s important to understand what actions other companies are considering, there’s no ‘quick fix’ or ‘one size fits all’ response. What we shouldn’t do is leave it unattended and only assume that disruption will have a negative impact.

The best thing organisations can do is re-discover; re-open the dialogue with their workforce (and customer base) to seek out opportunities.

At a time overcome with physical disconnection, now, more than ever is the time to listen. Everyone’s experience of being an employee during Covid-19 will be different. We’ve seen organisations that were once opposed to the idea of working from home, suddenly make it a top priority. People are managing the competing roles of employee, parent, caregiver and teaching assistant. Others may have worked the whole lockdown at their place of work, apprehensive as the rest ride it out in the safety of their home. In times of adversity, values and priorities shift; and employees are sure to request changes. This means organisations must relearn about their workforce.

Using digital and interactive tools, organisations can gather meaningful data and insight on workforce sentiment to recognise, understand and anticipate change. The insight will likely nod to things you already do well, but also opportunities and things that you might need to learn from scratch. Employee surveys will provide you with immediate, evidence-based insight which will help dispel old assumptions and help you understand your employee’s home working experience.

So, what questions should you be asking?

If you’re not asking the right questions, you’re at risk of diving into a treasure trove of statistics and statements and emerging with less than meaningful answers. Track what matters and that is your employees. Employees are the champions who underpin the success of your organisation, now is the time to ensure their needs are front and centre. So, hone in on the experience.

If we could read minds, we could in principle shape perfect experiences and keep experiences current, but we can’t. What we can do is listen with qualitative surveys and polls. This means, rather than measuring how employees do their work from home, delve into how employees feel about their work and new-found work environment and remote working practices. As intangible and evolving as culture can be, ask about it. Seek to understand employees’ sense of belonging, purpose and connectedness when working remotely. Understand not only how employees are directing energy towards their tasks but towards colleagues, collaborators and customers.

This feedback will help to discover what employees value, what the obstacles and enablers are, where there are opportunities for innovation and flexibility and even allude to the complementary aspects of office and home. It goes without saying that you cannot measure everything, but a suite of good metrics allows you to get a pretty good picture of what is actually happening and where opportunities lie. Above all else, taking the initiative to ask for candid feedback shows leadership and solidarity during these challenging times.

To close the loop, you must be prepared to act.

Then the information needs to be used to take action. Just as you can’t measure everything, not every piece of feedback is going to prove that your intuition is right or offer straightforward solutions. Action can be as simple as sharing the findings with your employees or sending out a newsletter to answer common concerns. If findings point toward larger changes, there’s the ability to rely on further research and workshops that are curated to unearthing practical solutions.

It’s hard to predict the precise effects, but organisations should look for ways that empower them to be optimistic, agile, and prepared.

When disruption is so extensive and effects so unpredictable it is hard to differentiate setbacks from opportunities, but we need to acknowledge that standards we used to live by have been overwritten and some may never apply again. Information is incredibly valuable and having more information is only a good thing. Having data will help make the uncertainty a bit more certain. It will provide immediate, robust insight to help you navigate through this challenging time and enable you to scale your efforts towards a changed and fresh future.

3 Things to Consider When Purchasing a Security System

Joe Anderson

Founder

Reflex Protect

"Before purchasing a security system: 1) Do your research. Ask family, friends and coworkers what they use and like, and read reviews. In addition, many police crime-prevention units and fire departments have alarm specialists who you can connect with for advice. 2) It's very important to go with a reputable company. When an alarm sounds, you want to be completely assured that your system is going to function as it should. 3) Remember, this is a long-term investment for your home. You don't need to break the bank, but you also don't want to go with bottom of the barrel. At the end of the day, a system that provides daily peace of mind and is a deterrent to would-be criminals is the goal."

In 1993, on a Thursday just before 3 p.m., Joe Anderson was in a deposition when a gunman entered his former law firm Pettit & Martin in San Francisco. That day, nine of Joe's friends and colleagues lost their lives. Joe was shocked, in a state of disbelief. In the following years, Columbine, Sandy Hook, and The Pulse nightclub shootings all occurred, and all Joe could think was "How can we stop this from ever happening again?" So, when his friend, co-founder and inventor Steve came to him with the idea for the Reflex Protect® product, he thought, "I wish this had been in the receptionist's hands 25 years earlier; it might have changed everything." Reflex Protect® is a safety company dedicated to providing highly effective non-lethal products and training for where you live, work, worship, and play. In short, it's a highly effective yet non-violent alternative for violent situations. Learn more at www.ReflexProtect.com.

2020-05-30||The short-run macro implications of school and childcare closures

The COVID-19 crisis has hit women’s employment particularly hard, partly because the worst-hit sectors have high female employment shares, but also because schools and daycare closures have forced more mothers to leave their jobs. This column looks at Germany, where 26% of the workforce has children aged 14 or younger, and quantifies the macroeconomic importance of working parents. If schools and daycare centres remain closed as the economy slowly reopens, 11% of workers and 8% of all working hours will be lost to the labour market. Policies to restart the economy must accommodate the concerns of these families.

Economies around the world are facing massive job losses – numbers in many countries are approaching those of the Great Depression in the 1930s. The unemployment rate in the US already reached 14.7% in April 2020, and real-time surveys put it as high as 24% during the week of 10–16 May (Bick and Blandin 2020).

Unlike in normal business cycles, where fluctuations in hours are driven largely by men (Doepke and Tertilt 2016), the COVID-19 recession has hit the employment of women particularly hard – partly because sectors with high female-employment shares (such as retail and tourism) have been strongly affected, but also because schools and daycare closures forced some mothers to leave their jobs (Alon et al. 2020, Torrejón et al. 2020).

Germany has been impressively sheltered so far. The unemployment rate in April 2020 stands at only 5.8%, but employers rely massively on short-term work. Among workers employed in January, 13% are either on short-term work or employed but not working, as of 24 May (Blom et al. 2020), while 28% of the workforce is working fully or partly from home.

We explore the labour market consequences of slowly ‘reopening’ the economy and increasing the demand for physical presence at the workplace, assuming schools and childcare centres remain at least partly closed. We first report what fraction of the workforce live with children in the household and then estimate what fraction of workers have to provide childcare if schools and childcare centres do not reopen to the extent the economy does. We also estimate what fraction of total hours will be lost in the labour market and find that the macroeconomic impact due to parents’ inability to work is likely large.

We use data from the 2018 European Labour Force Survey and consider all individuals aged 20 and older for the labour force. Rather than relying on detailed microdata on childcare arrangements, we follow Dingel et al. (2020) and estimate what percent of the workforce is affected by school and childcare closings based on pre-crisis data on employment, hours, and children across households. We assume that children aged 14 or younger cannot be left unsupervised alone at home.

While many behavioural responses can be expected after a large shock, adjusting the presence of children in the household seems near impossible in the short-run. Further, most margins that working parents use in normal times (such as hiring babysitters, sharing childcare duties with neighbours and friends, or relying on grandparents) are currently either explicitly banned by state law or at least highly discouraged. Thus, the most likely margin of adjustment to the closures is that one adult per household will stop working.

We start by looking at the share of employed workers with children aged 14 or younger in their households. Figure 1 shows that a notable proportion of the German workforce have children: one out of four employed workers (25.9%) have children at home. This number of workers is larger than the combined share of all workers in the German manufacturing and construction sector in 2019 (22.8%).

Figure 1 Childcare obligations of the employed in Germany

Comparing the first two bars in Figure 1, we see that 4% of households with children also include a non-working adult (such as a non-working mother, an older sibling, or grandparents). Assuming that these non-working adults could take over childcare and home-schooling obligations, we still find that one in five employees (21.2%) are without childcare if school and childcare centres remain closed.

Next, we estimate the share of workers who will be unable to work due to childcare obligations, assuming that one adult will stay home in each household. This share of employed workers therefore corresponds roughly to half of the couple households plus the share of single households.

In total, we estimate that about 11% of workers would have to stay at home, with 9% of these workers living in couple households and 2% being single parents. To put this number into perspective, we compare it to the unemployment rate of 5.8% in April 2020. Even if all unemployed workers in Germany found work immediately, this would just fill half the jobs potentially left vacant due to parents’ inability to work.

Couples can, and likely will, optimise when choosing who will stay at home. Within each household with childcare obligations, we identify the household member with the lowest regular hours of work and assume that this person will stay at home. This results in a total 8.4% reduction of work hours, of which 6.8% stem from workers in couple households and 1.6% from single parents. Within couple households, we find that in 82% of households, mothers work fewer hours than fathers. Thus the majority of hours lost to the labour market will likely be in female-dominated occupations.

Table 1 reports the same numbers separately for children above and below the school-entry age of 6, allowing us to separately assess work hours lost due to school closures and to daycare closures. For example, if schools reopen but daycare centres stay closed, still 9.8% (=6.3%+3.5%) of the employed are affected in that they have no caregiver in the household. If instead daycare centres reopen but schools stay closed, 15% (=11.5%+3.5%) of the employed have a childcare problem.

To gauge the macroeconomic effects, we compare the 8.4% lost hours to a popular policy instrument to deal with labour underutilisation, namely, short-time work. Short-time work programmes were prevalent during the Global Financial Crisis and are also heavily used now. In 2009, more than 1.1 million workers were on short-time work with an hours’ reduction of about one-third of their working time (28.1%). In other words, during the Global Financial Crisis, 3.1% of all employed workers were on short-time work and their hours’ reduction accounted for 1% of total hours worked in 2009.5

While these were massive programmes, the numbers are dwarfed by parents’ likely reduction in work hours during the current crisis. Based on the numbers in Table 1, we estimate that close to four times as many workers and more than eight times the share of hours would be lost due to parents’ inability to work due to childcare obligations.

Even if we overestimate the share of affected hours – because some children can stay alone for some time, some parents can work from home while simultaneously taking care of their children, or some other childcare arrangements like sharing between families or involving grandparents are used – it is clear that the impact of the childcare and school closings on hours worked is large. Most of the reduction of hours will likely come from women.

From a macroeconomic perspective, the labour supply of parents who would have to stay home if economic activity fully resumes but schools and childcare facilities remain closed is massive. We estimate the share of affected employed workers to be close to twice the number of all unemployed workers in Germany, and their share in hours worked is eight times the work reduction due to short-time work during the Global Financial Crisis.

While we acknowledge that workers might find creative solutions to organise childcare to best deal with this situation, the macroeconomic labour-supply effects are still so large that policy seems well advised to take parents’ labour-market situation into account when developing plans for restarting the economy.

While this column focuses on the current labour supply of parents, it is important to emphasise the potential long-run distributional and growth consequences that missing school and childcare has for society – consequences of less education, a decrease in intergenerational mobility, and the hurdles they put in the way of women forced to deal with career interruptions (von Gaudecker et al. 2020, Furceri et al. 2020, Burgess and Sievertsen 2020).

We find that in 82% of couples, the mother is working fewer hours and will likely step in to handle additional childcare needs (see also Jessen and Waights 2020). First numbers from real-time surveys in Germany confirm this assumption (Adams-Prassl et al. 2020, Möhring et al. 2020). Bayer and Kuhn (2020) demonstrate that starting at age 30, when children are young and need childcare, the gender-career gap opens up and contributes 50% to the gender pay gap 20 years later. School and childcare closures today will thus likely negatively affect intergenerational mobility and gender equality in the workplace.

2020-05-30||Non-performing loans are a crucial policy consideration, especially in times of wider economic crisis. This article uses a new database covering 88 banking crises since 1990 to draw lessons for post-COVID-19 resolution of non-performing loans. Compared to the 2008 crisis, the pandemic poses some different challenges. Despite some respite from the credit-crash of 2008, policymakers today are faced with substantially higher public debt, less profitable banks, and often weaker corporate sector conditions, making resolution of non-performing loans even more challenging.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy has come to a sudden halt. This is likely to bring about high levels of non-performing loans (NPLs), i.e. loans that are in (or close to) default. High NPLs are problematic because they impair bank balance sheets, depress credit growth, and delay economic recovery (Aiyar et al. 2015, Kalemli-Ozcan et al. 2015). Persistently high NPL ratios were a concern in several European countries after the 2008-2012 crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic could cause a re-emergence of the NPL problem.

High NPLs are a common feature of banking crises and tend to be studied around such events. Data presented in an existing report by Laeven and Valencia (2013) shows that NPL levels peak during crises, but more data are needed to understand how NPLs evolve and are resolved. Our recent ECB working paper (Ari et al., 2020) bridges this gap by presenting a new dataset on yearly NPL evolution during 88 banking crises since 1990. The dataset covers major regional and global crises (including the Nordic crisis, the Asian financial crisis, the Global Financial Crisis) and many standalone crises in developing, transition, and low-income economies. For each crisis, we report NPLs over an 11-year window around the crisis. What do we learn from these data?

During crises, NPLs typically follow an inverse U-shaped pattern. They start at modest levels, rise rapidly around the start of the crisis, and peak some years afterwards, before stabilising and declining. Looking at all crises, we see that NPL levels peak at about 20% of total loans on average, but the variance is large (especially in developing countries, where NPLs can exceed 50% of total loans). Only less than a fifth of banking crises avoid high NPLs, which we define as NPLs exceeding 7% of total loans.

Anticipating future levels of NPLs is key for formulating NPL resolution strategies. It is tempting to use pre-crisis NPLs to anchor such forecasts. Yet, pre-crisis NPL levels are not a good indicator of post-crisis NPL problems. After a crisis, NPLs increase to three times their pre-crisis values on average, and over ten times in extreme cases (Figure 1).

Note: Reproduced from Ari, Chen, and Ratnovski (2020), Figure 4. The chart shows peak NPLs for 88 banking crises since 1990. The left panel shows peak NPLs expressed as percent of total loans; the right panel shows peak NPL ratio (i.e. NPLs/total loans) expressed as a multiple of the pre-crisis NPL ratio. Crises that did not have high NPLs (with NPLs under 7% of total loans) are shown in light blue in the left panel.

Timely NPL resolution is difficult, but essential for economic recovery

Countries can facilitate the resolution of high NPLs using a mix of policy measures, such as:
• Asset quality reviews, to identify loans that are nonperforming and need restructuring
• Separating good and bad assets of banks (so-called ‘good bank’-‘bad bank’ resolution). This makes the financial conditions of good banks more transparent, steadies their market access, and lets them focus on extending new lending. Bad banks, often structured as asset management companies, proceed to extracting value from bad assets

More details on NPL resolution methods are provided in Balgova et al. (2016), Beck (2017), Brei et al. (2020), and in ECB Financial Stability Reviews by Grodzicki et al. (2015) and Fell et al. (2016 and 2017).

Despite the economic benefits of NPL reduction and the variety of methods available, the data paint a sobering picture of historic NPL resolution. While some countries resolve NPLs rapidly, a third of countries are saddled with NPLs for over seven years after a crisis. The NPL reduction outcomes after the Global Crisis are direr still: two-thirds of the countries that experienced high NPLs could not resolve those within seven years of the crisis (Figure 2). Strikingly, this also implies that while advanced economies tend to have lower post-crisis NPLs, they also take longer on average to resolve.

Note: Reproduced from Ari, Chen, and Ratnovski (2020), Figure 6. The left panel shows the number of countries that resolved NPLs (with NPL ratios to under 7%) in each year after the crisis. The right panel compares the number of counties that resolved and don’t resolve NPLs with 7 years. The colours distinguish the crisis waves and types.

In the paper, we use the ‘local projections’ method to assess the link between NPL resolution and post-crisis output dynamics, while controlling for their co-dependence. The results underscore that NPL resolution is critical for economic recovery. High and unresolved NPLs are associated with deeper recessions and slower recoveries. Six years after a banking crisis, output in countries that experience high NPLs is 6.5 percentage points lower in countries that don’t. Of the countries that have high NPLs, output in countries that do not resolve NPLs are more than ten percentage points lower than in countries that do (Figure 3).

Note: Reproduced from Ari, Chen, and Ratnovski (2020), Figure 6. The charts report the differences in output paths (expressed as percent of deviation from pre-crisis output between countries that, following a banking crisis, experience NPLs exceeding 7% compared to those that have NPLs under 7% (left panel), between countries that, having experienced NPLs exceeding 7%, manage to resolve them compared to those that do not (right panel).

NPL resolution in Europe after the 2008-2012 crisis

Further, we use a model selection approach to assess which pre-crisis indicators predict the dynamics of NPLs in banking crises. We document that peak NPLs are higher in countries with lower GDP per capita, after a credit boom, under fixed exchange rates, with less profitable banks, or banks with more fragile corporate balance sheets. NPL resolution is more protracted in similar circumstances, as well as in countries with high public debt and more sophisticated banking sectors. Interestingly, these high-level indicators have good predictive power (the average (pseudo) adjusted R-squared across the specifications is 0.24).

These results shed light on the factors behind the high, and persistent, NPLs in some European countries after the 2008-2012 crisis. In the paper, we compare actual NPL dynamics in seven European countries (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Hungary, and Slovenia) with what could have been anticipated based on historical patterns. It turns out that high NPL levels in Europe in 2010s were hard to anticipate: the crisis was extraordinarily severe for advanced economies. By contrast, protracted NPL resolution was in line with historical patterns: it is common for crises that follow a credit boom (Figure 4). Indeed, the long-term negative consequences of credit booms are well-documented in the literature (Caballero et al. 2008). They are related to the difficulties in resolving the debt of non-viable ‘zombie’ firms and households that are ‘underwater’ on their housing assets.

Note: Reproduced from Ari, Chen, and Ratnovski (2020), Figure 7. The chart shows NPL metrics: actual (in green) and out-of-sample predicted (in blue), on average for a sample of European countries affected by the 2008-2012 crisis. The metrics of NPLs are: peak NPLs as percent of total loans (left panel) and the duration of NPL resolution in years (right panel).

What does this mean for NPL resolution after COVID-19?

Even though our paper studies NPLs in the context of banking crises, and therefore cannot be mapped perfectly to the COVID-19 events, it provides valuable insights into impending NPL challenges. Our results highlight forces that can make NPL resolution after the COVID-19 events different from the situation after the 2008-2012 crisis. Some forces are enabling of NPL resolution. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic is not a credit boom-induced crisis. If the economic downturn proves temporary, many post-COVID-19 NPLs may relate to viable illiquid firms, rather than unviable zombie firms. European banks have entered the COVID-19 pandemic with (on average) higher capital ratios compared to the 2008 crisis. The recently introduced IFRS-9 accounting standards may induce faster NPL recognition, and hence resolution, thanks to their forward-looking nature (although a ‘too fast’ NPL recognition may also constrain bank lending during downturns). Other forces point to challenges in NPL resolution. Compared to 2008, most European countries have substantially higher public debt, less profitable banks, and often weaker corporate sector conditions (the factors that historically have complicated NPL resolution). Moreover, if the economic recovery from the pandemic is slow and protracted, credit losses from corporate distress will rise and could overwhelm banks, further complicating NPL resolution.

Given the importance of NPL reduction for economic recovery, and many countries’ historical difficulties in implementing effective NPL-related interventions, designing effective NPL resolution policies for the post-COVID-19 world is a key forward-looking financial policy issue for Europe today.

2020-05-30||As debates about the future of the World Health Organization rage on, the Covid-19 pandemic is a reminder of the vital importance of global public health institutions. This column considers what principles should guide WHO’s missions and tools to deal with pandemics, which are distinguished from other health risks by their high contagion, extreme potential outcomes in terms of mortality risk, and the ‘weak-link’ aspect of global collective action. It argues that reforms should centre around having a narrower mission – Global Response to Infectious Diseases, or GRID – and creating better incentives to prevent contagions from spreading globally using stronger legal and financial tools.

The World Health Assembly, the annual decision-making meeting of the World Health Organization (WHO), met in May over videoconference. The squabbling over the institution’s funding and political independence that erupted between the US and China highlighted the embattled state of the global public health institution facing its biggest ever challenge – the Covid-19 pandemic.

WHO’s initial response has been heavily criticised, and there is a real risk that without reforms, it will wither into irrelevance (e.g. Buranyi 2020). Yet, the pandemic has also vividly demonstrated why WHO is needed, given the critical role that detecting, tracing, and containing contagion play in saving lives across the globe.

Economists have been active in helping us think about the appropriate policy responses to mitigate economic damage from the global pandemic, focusing on fiscal and monetary policies, financial regulation, social insurance, industry, and trade (Baldwin and Weber di Mauro 2020).

Here, we take a longer-term view and use insights from public economics and the economics of organisations to think about changes to WHO’s mission and tools that would enable it to deal more effectively with outbreaks of infectious disease that threaten to become pandemics.

The emerging literature on bureaucracies and public organisations that focuses on incentive and organisation design issues in the context of the provision of public goods offers some particularly relevant lessons ( Dewatripont et al. 1999, Besley and Ghatak 2018). It suggests that diffuse missions, noisy output measures, and task multiplicity make them appear less effective than their private sector counterparts even in the best of times, and potentially disastrous in times of crisis. No wonder, then, that WHO looks weak now, as it did when Ebola struck (Wenham 2017).

Three features distinguish this pandemic from other health risks:
• First, as with all infectious diseases, an individual’s health depends not only on their own behaviour but on the behaviour of others – that is, there is a large externality.
• Second, the virus’ contagiousness and capacity to travel means that all are vulnerable if one government (the weakest link) mismanages the crisis: China’s initial handling of the outbreak was very much the ‘O-ring’ of global public health (Kremer 1993).
• Third, the potential threat to lives and livelihoods is huge, immediate, and visible, making the case for concerted action easier than for other global risks, such as climate change.

These features require swift and sustained international coordination both to respond to this pandemic and to prevent future ones. They also imply that the absence of global coordination might lead governments to opt for isolationism. Closing borders so that foreigners can’t bring disease in may seem like a reasonable short-term response, but it will have enormous human and economic costs over a longer period (e.g. Trilling 2020 on the situation of refugees, Freund 2020 on the costs of shortening global value chains).

There is another solution. The world has already experienced a ‘trial-run’ for coping with major global risks: airline security in response to 9/11. Like the current pandemic, terrorism posed a grave threat and showed that the international community is only as strong as its weakest member. Significant progress was made in countering this threat by establishing universal air-travel security standards and monitoring their enforcement.

To reinvent itself to counter the threat of pandemics effectively, WHO needs three things.

First, a narrower focus. A disease will have to meet three criteria for WHO intervention: large global externalities, high mortality risk, and a ‘weak-link’ aspect to government action. Eradicating malaria, for example, is an extremely worthwhile goal, but the disease does not travel much internationally, making direct intervention (as opposed to financial support of the type given by the Global Fund) by an international institution unnecessary.

Following the model of recent global public health funds with a narrow focus (Sridhar and Woods 2013), WHO must redefine its core mission around the global response to infectious diseases – let us call this hypothetical division ‘GRID’.

Other aspects of public health could be left to WHO’s research and advisory departments. This means a sharp departure from its current agenda, which covers many aspects of global health, from mental wellbeing to obesity, with no clear prioritisation. WHO should focus on aspects of public health for which the externalities are truly global, the potential risks high, and the interdependence in outcomes across countries so strong that isolated national responses won’t suffice.

The second thing WHO needs is capacity – beyond that granted by the International Health Regulations (Gostin et al. 2015) – to sanction countries that do not follow its rules. The global community gave the WTO powers to impose economic sanctions on its member states. Avoiding another pandemic is at least as worthy a goal as increasing global trade and should be backed with similar sanctioning power.

Particular care must be paid to how sanctions are designed. Sanctioning a state in which a pandemic starts may sound like a good idea, but is not credible in practice. When such a disaster strikes, GRID’s mission would require it to offer the afflicted country support. This means that GRID cannot sanction countries based on outcomes but on the steps taken to abide by its recommendations.

Third, WHO needs a budget adequate to the task. WHO’s current annual budget, roughly $2 billion, is not much higher than the budget of the main hospital in its host city, Geneva. Determining the exact amounts needed is best left to public health specialists and epidemiologists, but the current budget is clearly and grossly inadequate.

Consider, for example, what it would cost to prevent the international spread of a highly contagious disease through air travel. Taking the estimated cost of a Covid-19 test ($10 according to Romer 2020) and the number of air passengers in 2018 (4.2 billion) as a benchmark, $42 billion would be needed for testing international travellers alone. Airlines may of course be willing to foot some of the bill for these tests if their survival is at stake (and we expect the number of air passengers to fall in the short run). But even half that number is ten times WHO’s current budget.

How would GRID raise money? One option would levy ‘user-fees’ on those benefitting the most from the global movement of people, something that GRID would protect. Multinational corporations top that list. Torslov et al. (2020) estimate that they made $1.7 trillion in profits from their international activities in 2015, a non-trivial share of which is booked in tax havens and therefore subject to little taxation. A 5% tax on these international profits alone would generate $85 billion.

International air passengers and airlines could also be asked to chip in, if only to pay for the testing infrastructure in airports. While clearly ambitious, these proposals are not without real-world precedent. UNITAID, a global health fund, is already partially funded by a tax on international air travel levied by several countries.

Giving GRID its own sources of funding would free it from relying on voluntary contributions by individual countries and shield it from the undue political influence of powerful countries (e.g. Huang 2020). These new sources of funding would need to raise enough funds to finance GRID’s recurring prevention, monitoring, and research expenditures. In addition, GRID must be given the right to borrow to mobilise funds quickly when a global public health emergency occurs.

If we neglect the writing on the wall about WHO, the uncoordinated responses of national governments will hurt ordinary citizens across the globe, especially the poorest and most vulnerable. The virus does not respect borders or walls; our response must transcend them as well.

2020-05-30||Cities rise and fall, but the city has a way of confounding its would-be obituarists. Futurists thought digital communications would kill off urban living. The growth of the suburbs threatened to hollow out the centre.

The 9/11 attacks were presumed by many to mark the end of the era of the skyscraper. For centuries, war, pollution, violence and plague have reminded us that density makes us vulnerable, but still the majority of us – 55 per cent of the world’s population, by the United Nations’ latest count – choose to live this way. Indeed, cities often emerge stronger from their moments of greatest peril. The 1918 influenza pandemic killed millions of Europeans, but within a few years Paris and Berlin were booming again.

That resilience tells us the modern city will survive the Covid-19 pandemic. But it could yet be transformed by the crisis.

This has been a largely metropolitan trauma. Wherever the virus has taken hold, the epicentres – Wuhan, Madrid, New York, London – are big cities where people live in close quarters, commute on cramped trains, pray in big congregations and drink in crowds. What gave cities their life also helped take it away. One of the recurring visual motifs of the past three months has been the haunting image of the abandoned city, with its streets deserted, shops boarded up and office blocks lying empty.

Some of those closures will be permanent, because if and when the health crisis comes to an end – as it will if the virus burns itself out, immunity levels reach critical mass or a treatment or vaccine become available – another, economic, crisis will continue.

Many shops and restaurants will not make it out the other side. Cultural life will be reeling from the shock of the lockdown; Unesco, the United Nations cultural agency, has warned that the pandemic may permanently close one in eight of the world’s museums.

Social distancing will result in longer queues, Spartan pubs and a generally more monochrome version of urban life. And with the enforced shift towards remote working having opened people’s eyes to an alternative routine, many employers (alert to the savings they can make by reducing their office space) and workers (tired of high housing costs and long commutes) may come to the same conclusion: that the office itself is obsolete. Prohibitive living costs were already resulting in population decline in some western cities. This would accelerate it.

Cities have always flourished because people are drawn to the possibilities they offer: jobs, trade, exchange of ideas. That constant inward flow is what sustains and renews them. If the looming recession is accompanied by a nativist, protectionist turn, and that results in stricter migration policies, it would prolong the downturn and speed up population decline in many cities. Philadelphia, for example, would have shrunk without immigration over the past five years.

But unless pandemics become the new normal – which as the urban economist Edward Glaeser of Harvard University has noted would result in tens of millions of urban service jobs disappearing and large-scale social dislocation – then the current crisis should allow for a broader rethink about how cities are designed, maintained and lived in. Just as the cholera outbreaks of the 1830s resulted in better sanitation in London and the tuberculosis epidemic in New York in the early 20th century led to better housing regulations and public transport, the current crisis could turn out to be an important inflection point. Some cities have already begun to reorganise themselves by creating more room for pedestrians and cyclists, improving homeless accommodation and taking steps to free up tourist housing for residents. Many of these are nominally stopgap measures, but it will be difficult to reverse them.

But the new momentum behind the push for urban cycling infrastructure and an expansion of public spaces is only a start. A more thorough rethink would consider how to improve sustainability, food security and living standards. It would note how, in many cities, the poor and ethnic minorities have been particularly vulnerable, and ask what that has to do with housing conditions and economic geography. It would look at ways of easing pollution and commuting times by making city life more compact. (In Paris, mayor Anne Hidalgo talks of creating the “quarter-hour city”, where most daily needs are withing a 15-minute walk, cycle or public transport journey.) It would think about ways to renew artistic life and rejuvenate the creative scenes that have been endangered by soaring rents.

The city is where the future happens first. Its transitory, unforgiving, fleeting nature, its constant capacity for reinvention, is what makes it so intoxicating. If any good can come of the agony of Covid-19, it is that the city, the epicentre of the epidemic, can be the laboratory for a new wave of experiments into better living.||0

2020-05-30||Apart from the pregnant women, there were some elderly passengers, young children and a seriously ill patient, authorities said.

The Vietnam Airlines flight VN579, organized specially to repatriate Vietnamese citizens, landed at the Da Nang International Airport at 4:40 p.m.

All passengers had undergone medical checks before boarding and wore face masks throughout the flight. They submitted health declarations and were transferred to quarantine facilities in the central province of Quang Nam on arrival. Their samples have been taken for testing.

According to Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center, it was the first repatriation of Vietnamese from Taiwan since Vietnam suspended all international flights on March 22.

One of the repatriated passengers is suffering from pancreatic cancer. The passenger will be transferred to a local hospital for isolation and cancer treatment, said Tran Van Kiem, director of Quang Nam Center for Disease Control.

Nguyen Duc Hoang, deputy director of Thang Binh District’s medical center, said some of the 243 pregnant women on the flight were near their due dates. Therefore, the center has prepared emergency ambulances and set up an obstetrics emergency team in case they give birth in the quarantine area.

On the way to Taiwan, the flight carried a number of Taiwanese citizens and Vietnamese with Taiwan residency who had been stranded in Vietnam.

In the last few months, several special flights have repatriated thousands of Vietnamese from several countries including Canada, France, Japan, Russia, the UAE and the U.S., and other Southeast Asian countries. Passengers paid their own fares.

Vietnam has gone 43 days without community transmission of Covid-19. Of the 328 infections recorded so far, 49 are active, the rest having recovered. There has been no death recorded so far.

Taiwan has confirmed 442 infection cases and reported seven deaths.||1

2020-05-30||Dovere: You think you’re going to have to fire police officers and firefighters in Dayton if you don’t get more federal money?

Whaley: Absolutely. Sixty percent of the budget is police and fire. Ohio is a municipal-income state. Seventy percent of the budget of Dayton comes from earnings tax, so if people aren’t working, you don’t have a budget. It immediately falls out, I think in July or August, after the unemployment runs out.

And all the other cities in Ohio are in the same boat. Anywhere from 15 to 25 percent is where the Ohio mayors are thinking the trouble will be. And when 60 percent of the budget is police and fire, you just can’t get to an 18 percent cut without doing something about police and fire. And we’ve already cut enormously during the Great Recession and before.

Dovere: If you’re looking already at a spike in homicides and overdoses, and you’re going to look forward to likely cuts to police and fire, what does that mean for the way a city functions?

Whaley: Well, I just don’t think it will function well. And it’s egregious, frankly. You’ll bail out airlines. You’ll bail out every other thing known to man, but not police or fire? Are you serious?

Dovere: And it’s not like everything is, like, calm otherwise. We’re seeing what is happening in Minneapolis with George Floyd, who was killed, and the violence that has erupted after that. One of the things that I have been struck by over the course of the three months of this lockdown is that the social fabric has held as much as it has. Does that worry you?

Whaley: If any mayor tells you they don’t worry about what’s happening in Minneapolis happening in their city, they’re really naive or they’re not telling you the truth.

I remember when Freddie Gray happened in Baltimore, Mayor [Michael] Coleman was the mayor of Columbus and he was friends with Mayor [Stephanie] Rawlings-Blake. And so I called and said, “Have you checked in on her? How is she doing?” “Oh yeah, it’s very tough, Nan.” And he just said: “Because by the grace of God, we all go.”

I mean, the social fabric, you do a lot of work on it in your community. But there are things you just don’t control. And you have to recognize that too.

Dovere: It’s been one year since tornadoes hit Dayton. There was a mass shooting in August. You’ve spent so much of the last year in a consoler role, helping people get through these tragedies. We have seen a real lack of that on the national level. What do you think, given your experience, needs to be said and needs to be done as people continue to feel the hit of this, whether through a death or job loss.

Whaley: I don’t see a lot of empathy in the national dialogue at all right now. And I recognize there’s not a lot of women besides the speaker there. I have learned and appreciate the value of vulnerability and leading through being vulnerable. And that means to show that you’re human, to show that this is hard on you too, but to be resolved—and honestly resolved—that you’re going to get through it.

I long for leadership that shows some empathy. And I long for leadership that, even if I don’t agree with it, I can respect. And that’s why I do appreciate Governor [Mike] DeWine. We do not agree. Even through the pandemic, I have disagreed with him. But I respect him. And I learned from the shooting that he does have empathy. And I long for that kind of leadership in the federal government. That’s, I think, that’s what I miss the most.||0

3 Things to Consider When Purchasing a Security System

Joe Anderson

Founder

Reflex Protect

"Before purchasing a security system: 1) Do your research. Ask family, friends and coworkers what they use and like, and read reviews. In addition, many police crime-prevention units and fire departments have alarm specialists who you can connect with for advice. 2) It's very important to go with a reputable company. When an alarm sounds, you want to be completely assured that your system is going to function as it should. 3) Remember, this is a long-term investment for your home. You don't need to break the bank, but you also don't want to go with bottom of the barrel. At the end of the day, a system that provides daily peace of mind and is a deterrent to would-be criminals is the goal."

In 1993, on a Thursday just before 3 p.m., Joe Anderson was in a deposition when a gunman entered his former law firm Pettit & Martin in San Francisco. That day, nine of Joe's friends and colleagues lost their lives. Joe was shocked, in a state of disbelief. In the following years, Columbine, Sandy Hook, and The Pulse nightclub shootings all occurred, and all Joe could think was "How can we stop this from ever happening again?" So, when his friend, co-founder and inventor Steve came to him with the idea for the Reflex Protect® product, he thought, "I wish this had been in the receptionist's hands 25 years earlier; it might have changed everything." Reflex Protect® is a safety company dedicated to providing highly effective non-lethal products and training for where you live, work, worship, and play. In short, it's a highly effective yet non-violent alternative for violent situations. Learn more at www.ReflexProtect.com.

2020-05-29|NEW DELHI: India reported the highest single-day rise in Covid-19 cases as well as deaths, with over 7,700 new infections detected and 270 fatalities related to the virus reported on Friday. With this, the country’s Covid-19 count has risen to nearly 1.69 lakh cases while the death toll is close to 5,000 at 4,978.The day also saw a big leap in the number of coronavirus patients who have recovered from the infection, with Maharashtra reporting as many as 8,381 discharges, taking the total count to over 82,000 from 70,900 on Thursday.The huge spike in deaths — the previous highest was 199 reported on May 5 — was partly due to the Delhi government reporting 82 deaths on Friday, of which 69 were reported to have taken place during the course of the month.As many as 7,713 new infections were reported on Friday, a big jump from the previous high of 6,926, reported just a day earlier. On six of the last nine days, the daily count of cases has touched a new peak, indicating a surge in cases in the country. India’s total coronavirus count stands at 1,68,780.While Maharashtra again reported by far the country’s highest number of new cases, at least seven sta5tes recorded ther biggest jump in infections in a single day — Delhi (1,106 cases), Tamil Nadu (874), Karnataka (248), Haryana (217), Uttarakhand (216), Telangana (169) and Jharkhand (45).In several other states, the count of fresh cases remained high. Rajasthan reported 298 infections, Bengal 277, Uttar Pradesh 275, J&K 128, Assam 144 and Chhattisgarh 51, giving an overall picture of cases on the rise in many parts of the country.

2020-05-29||Going stir-crazy in quarantine? You’re not alone. Celebrities are cooped up in their homes across the country just like the rest of us. As we collectively navigate this uncharted territory, USA TODAY presents Quarantine Diaries, which give readers a peek into how our favorite stars are spending their time at home.

Today's diarist is comedian Kathy Griffin, who made a cameo in Netflix's "You" in January and released her documentary, "Kathy Griffin: A Hell of a Story," last summer about the aftermath of her infamous Donald Trump photo scandal. Griffin, 59, made headlines in March after her trip to the emergency room, during which she was unable to get a coronavirus test despite "unbearably painful symptoms." She has since recovered and recently tested negative.

Griffin stirred up fresh controversy Tuesday, tweeting that Trump should be injected with a "syringe with nothing but air inside it," which can be lethal. She has since shared her feelings following the death of George Floyd.

Here's what a day of Griffin's quarantine is like in California, where she's quarantining with husband Randy Bick, two employees and the couple's four dogs: Olivia Benson, Elliot Stabler, and new puppies Maggie and Mary (named after her mother, Maggie Mary Griffin, who died in March at 99). – As told to Hannah Yasharoff

4 a.m. My husband and I are getting up about twice in the night with the dogs. They're not 100% potty trained, so we still get up to take them out. But the dogs have been really helpful and therapeutic. I want to encourage people to foster, even for just a few months. It's going to help you maybe more than the animal.

9:30 a.m. When I wake up for real, Business Lady Kathy is always working, through COVID or not. This morning I had a conference call with two of my lawyers and my CPA. I'm super hands-on with my finances. In this era, I'm kind of going through and saying "Do I really need this? Can I stop doing this?"

10 a.m. I make an old-school smoothie – not from the box or anything. It's just fresh blueberries, bananas, peanut butter, Yakult, strawberries. Sometimes we'll throw greens in there.

On keeping in touch with friends:Sia and I make these one-minute videos for each other almost every day and we send them to each other. Some of them are "How are you feeling today?" and some are just silly.

On how her Trump scandal prepared her for quarantine: I kind of feel like I lost my old life twice. It's almost three years ago to the day of the Trump photo when a big part of my "old" life ended with friends and work opportunities. And now with COVID, everybody is dealing with, "Oh gosh, I actually kind of had an old life, this is a sort of purgatory." Hopefully, we get over the edge to something better.

Lunch: I will admit, we have nothing close to a meal schedule around here. People kind of grab their own thing when they feel like it. But if we sit together, we actually try to eat six feet apart.

I have a new diet plan that I am not recommending. You know how a lot of people diet and they go six days on, and one cheat day? I have decided, based on no data, that I'm going to do day on/day off. So one day, it's a green drink, it's a vegan meal. Then the next day I might eat an entire cake. But the point is I'm going to get back to the green drink the next day.

On writing political jokes right now: Every day, there's obviously a deluge of scary news, but then there's also one (headline) where I'm like, "I can spin that." A crazy press conference with Jared Kushner, for example. I don't want people to think I'm anti-America – I love America. Let the newsmakers say he's not qualified to have that job. But what I can say is that every time he walks out on camera, he honestly looks like he just left a spa. He looks like he gets five facials a day. For me, this is probably the build-up to my next stand-up special.

On finding ways to help: Taking action is something that I love to do. My assistant did a great job of tracking down a catering company that has experience bringing meals to hospitals. I was proud of being able to help there. I sent pizzas to urgent care – I had my assistant say they could have anything they wanted to eat, and they were like, "pizzas." I try to share feel-good things on social media and then make fun of myself in some way.

On staying active: I am fortunate enough to have a large backyard and I'm still too scared to even go out on my street in a mask to walk around. I put on my iPod and I have the corniest music – my friends always tease me about it. They're like, "Did your 14-year-old niece make this for you?" It's Backstreet Boys, Celine Dion, Josh Groban, Lady Gaga, Liza Minnelli. So there's a big square in my yard and I walk around it for an hour.

7:30 p.m. I can't boil water, I must confess. We have a lot of discussions about if it's safe to do curbside pickup. Let's say we want a pizza. I say only restaurants that are willing to come out and put the food in the trunk of the car. That's how risk-averse I'm trying to be.

What I'm watching: "90 Day Fiance." And I have never in my life watched more "Dateline" and "Snapped." This quarantine has turned me into someone who loves everything "As Seen on TV." You know those commercials? I thought I wasn't going to be buying these things until I was 90, but I'm super excited about my grabber.

10 p.m. One member of our little quarantine team made homemade chocolate marshmallow banana bread. And then he made homemade hot fudge. So I have to report a crime: I think someone intruded into my home last night and accidentally put together, in a really large bowl, a microwaved large slice of that banana bread, quite a bit of vanilla ice cream – you know burglars, they take everything – and then this burglar also took the time to heat the hot fudge and put that on top of everything. In the old world, I might have done that once or twice a month, but like everyone, now I have days where I'm like, "Everything's going to be great!" and other days where I'm like, "Screw it, let's have some hot fudge."

11 p.m. We'll try to go to bed early, which for me is around 11, but sometimes we'll just stay up if we're really engrossed in a show. We just got through Season 2 of "The Crown," and it's one of those things where you're like, "Want to watch one more?"

How I'm feeling: I hope people take this much more seriously. I'm very frightened by the misinformation. This is an opportunity for some of us to undo some of our mistakes. I don't think my Trump photo was a mistake and I'm actually quite proud of it, but I'm hoping this will get us out of some of our bubbles.

I do have a little optimism that after all this, we might be a little more mindful and thoughtful. I, of course, will still be spouting vulgarity and things like that. But only if you're laughing.||0
2020-05-31||The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a crisis in the UK universities

The COVID-19 pandemic is causing serious financial problems for UK universities. This column identifies the over-reliance on Chinese students for fee income as the main cause of the impact and considers what steps the government might take to support universities through this crisis.

The COVID-19 pandemic is having widespread effects on inequality (Overman 2020, Furceri et al. 2020) and education. Its effects on the UK’s higher education (HE) system could also be dramatic (see Dolton 2020). In this column, I suggest that the present financial problems of universities are rooted in their growing reliance of UK universities on the huge growth in overseas students coming to the UK for higher education. This growth has been more or less exclusively from China. Figure 1 shows how the numbers of new students arriving in the UK over the years 2006 to 2019 has changed. The numbers coming from nearly all countries other than China has remained approximately constant. But the numbers coming from China have risen from 25,000 in 2006 to approaching 90,000 by 2019. This over-reliance on recruiting Chinese students has meant that the UK HE system is vulnerable to any change in policy from the Chinese government or an exogenous event like COVID-19.

Figure 2 charts how the university funding system has changed over the last 10 years. In 2010 over half of the funding came from central government. Now only approximately 25% of funding comes from central government. The remainder comes directly from student fee income. The reality is that the present UK HE funding regime involves a large-scale underinvestment in research and an element of cross subsidisation of fee income to fund research.

Source: Author’s calculations based on data from House of Commons Briefing Paper 7393.

Another major headache for UK university finances has been the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) and its associated problems. This is the largest private sector pension scheme in the UK, with assets of over £68 billion. Recent calculations indicate that the scheme has a valuation shortfall of between £6.6 billion (Reeve 2019) and £17.5 billion (Borej 2017). This will result in rising university employer contributions to the scheme, exacerbating their financial problems.

Will the overseas students come to the UK to study next academic year?

How bad are the implications of COVID-19 for the short-term and long-term future of the UK higher education system? Should universities plan on opening in September, or do they move their operations online? The truth of the matter is that we do not presently know the exact nature of the implications of COVID-19 for future student demand. Some universities are planning for worst-case scenarios that could involve losing up to 75% of their overseas students and a drop of 20% of home students attending university this September, potentially leading to severe financial trouble. In this worst-case scenario, it has been suggested that all universities except Oxford and Cambridge could become insolvent.

In a survey conducted by the British Council (2020), it was suggested that up to 50% of postgraduate students who were planning to come to the UK are planning to defer and around 20% are likely to change where they go as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If the demand for UK university education from countries like China, India, and many of the African countries proves to be resilient, then these measures may not be necessary. Clearly there will be many overseas students who choose not to come to the UK in September 2020. But does this mean that they will never come? Surely a sizeable fraction of this demand will still be in place in September 2021 and many students will simply defer for a year. This logic may justify the government viewing the impending financial crisis of UK HE as a short run liquidity crisis.

What measures can universities take in the short run?

The main issue facing universities right now is to prevent themselves from going broke in the short run and planning for the opening of campuses in September. But what will happen if universities are not allowed to open again in September? Or indeed what happens if there is a second or subsequent wave of the pandemic? Universities should have contingency plans for these eventualities. Those without reserves or endowments will have little alternative but to make representations to central government for special financial help. But it has already been signalled that this will come at the price of considerable structural reforms.

Faced with these large expected losses in income, many universities in the UK are already implementing, or planning to implement, hiring freezes, redundancies, termination of short-term contracts, dropping courses and even whole degree programmes, and closing departments. Talk of mergers of neighbouring universities have been rumoured – although the evidence on the efficiencies to be gained is weak (Johnes 2013). Senior management at some universities has taken a voluntary pay cut and proposed that professorial staff follow suit. These measures have large adverse implications for employment in the university sector, with some estimates suggesting up to 300,000 job losses (London Economics 2020).

The calculations of risk liability based on the financial position of different universities suggest that between 30 to 50 of them could be in immediate danger of insolvency (London Economics 2020, Brackley 2020). Brackley (2020) has calculated the universities that are at most risk of financial failure, with an ‘at risk score’ that takes into account the current financial position of the university on debts and loans and their exposure to the loss of fee income from overseas students. The estimated cash loss as a fraction of total income and the ordering of the ‘at risk score’ are presented in Figure 3. Cluster 1 includes Oxford and Cambridge, cluster 2 consists of the traditional universities in the Russell Group, cluster 3 consists of the other pre-1992 universities, and cluster 4 captures the remainder. It shows that two of the universities with the lowest risk score, the green dots of Oxford and Cambridge, are at the extreme right end of the at-risk ordering. Figure 3 also shows that the estimated cash loss varies across universities from 0-20%. The universities at most risk of financial failure (the vertical axis in the figure) come from Cluster 3 and 4 but there are some potential casualties from the Cluster 2 as well. So, it is possible that there could be some universities with a considerable research reputation in severe financial difficulty as a result of this pandemic.

What can or should the government be doing to help?

Can a government in office be seen to allow various universities to close? Politically this could result in quite a high popularity hit. This would be especially true if the universities in question were predominantly in the North of England, Scotland and Wales. Arguably, it is expensive to merge and restructure a university with a neighbour and there is relatively little evidence in favour of potential economies of scale (Payne 2008). But this should not prevent universities from seriously considering this option in an attempt to rationalise their provision and economise on costs. Another pertinent point to consider is whether neighbouring universities should be forced to merge by the government.

In response to the potential loss of overseas student fee income, UUK (2020) asked the government for a £2.2 billion boost to short run research funding. What the government decided to do instead was increase research funding by only £100 millio and allow an advance on undergraduate fee income from the Student Loans company to the tune of £2.6 billion. This represents a loan of around 10% of fee income to universities. While this loan will be a short-run lifeline for some universities, it only stores up future funding problems as these loans will inflate future financial obligations. We do not presently know how this loan will be released to universities or whether it will be in direct proportion to each university’s existing level of potential fee shortfall. The latest word from the HM Treasury is that a potential financial handout to any institution in financial trouble could be possible in exchange for restructuring reforms.

2020-05-31||Earlier this month, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) reported first-quarter 2020 results. (3D Systems' results here and Stratasys' here). We're going to compare the two 3D printing companies' results metric for metric.

Keep in mind that qualitative factors can be just as meaningful as quantitative ones and we're looking at just one quarter. Even with these caveats, however, the findings from this exercise should help you make investing decisions in the 3D printing space.

Both companies experienced fairly sizable year-over-year sales declines. These declines were in the same ballpark percentage-wise, so this category is a draw.

Both companies were already struggling to grow revenue before the COVID-19 pandemic due largely to a weak global macroeconomic industrial environment. 3D Systems was also hurt by having to pause shipments of its factory metals printing solution due to quality issues. (Shipments resumed in April.)

The pandemic hurt both companies' results, with the brunt of the impact in March. The impact was due largely to lower demand from customers in their target verticals, particularly those in the aerospace and auto industries. 3D Systems management also said that the company experienced supply chain interruptions.

Both companies were unprofitable from a GAAP basis. 3D Systems is the winner (or the "lesser loser," more accurately) here because its results improved relative to the year-ago period, while Stratasys' got considerably worse.

3D Systems gets this win, too. Its non-GAAP (adjusted) loss per share narrowed from the year-ago period. Stratasys' result considerably worsened, flipping to negative, from positive.

Stratasys is the clear winner here. Its adjusted gross margin was 5.7 percentage points higher than 3D Systems'.

Stratasys is also the winner if we consider GAAP gross margin. Its result for this metric was 45%, versus 3D Systems' 42.4%.

A higher gross margin relative to a competitor with a quite similar business can reflect stronger pricing power.

Stratasys generated cash from operations in the quarter, while 3D Systems ate into its cash to run its operations.

In addition, Stratasys had about twice as much cash on hand as its competitor at the end of the period. Its stronger balance sheet gives it the upper hand in acquisitions and the ability to better withstand tough times.

Stratasys spent more money -- both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of revenue -- on R&D than did 3D Systems.

R&D spending can be viewed as an investment to fuel growth. It's critical for companies in the technology space to continue to innovate.

There was no runaway winner, but Stratasys did edge out 3D Systems.

Keep in mind the two caveats mentioned at the top of this article: qualitative factors can be as important as quantitative ones, and we only considered one quarter's results.||1

 Sunday, Channel 4, 9.15pm

 Like many other teenagers, Carmen and Lupita Andrade love playing the piano, doing handstands, hanging out with friends and dressing up together. However, they are two very special young ladies — two in a million, you could say. Born in 2002 in Mexico, the omphalopagus twins were given three days to live. But while most conjoined twins are either stillborn or die within the first few hours of being born, the sisters have survived against the odds. Carmen and Lupita moved to the US when they were babies with their parents and received expert medical care. Fast forward 19 years, and This documentary follows the twins, still conjoined and living in small-town Connecticut. They are growing up fast, but the fiercely intelligent and funny young women dare not plan too far ahead. After all, they are Mexicans in Trump’s America – and their visas are in danger of being withdrawn.

In this French psychological thriller, star violinist-turned-conductor Helene Barizet (Marie-Sophie Ferdane) has come home to Paris to take over the musical direction of the Philharmonia, a national orchestra in turmoil. She is a controversial choice, offered the job after the sudden death of the previous conductor, and she has formidable adversaries, including Agathe (Charlie Bruneau), a musician and her husband’s secret mistress. In addition, her mother has serious mental-health issues and Helene fears that she will end up like her. One of her first moves at the Philharmonia is to offer the role of concertmaster to the youngest musician, Selena (Lina el Arabi), an act which upsets the old concertmaster and the rest of the orchestra.

Tesco: Panic in the Aisles

 Sunday, Channel 5, 7.15pm

 When the coronavirus pandemic first began to take hold in March, Britain went into a panic-buying frenzy. Fiona Phillips reports on how supermarket chain Tesco coped with increased demand at its stores and how consumers’ shopping habits changed. As the British public filled their cupboards with more than £2 billion worth of extra groceries, Tesco doubled its share of the growing online market. However, with its supermarket shelves stripped bare and thousands of staff self-isolating or being off sick, company bosses faced an enormous logistical challenge.

It’s been tough on everyone living in lockdown, but for some it’s been unimaginably tough, and this documentary features four people for whom the Covid crisi has brought pain, sadness and a huge sense of loss. Each of them writes a letter to a loved one they are separated from. You might want to steel yourself for an emotional ride, as these letters spell out the prosaic reality of living through a pandemic that prevents them from holding their loved ones close to them.

Dubliner Billy Jenkins (87) writes to his beloved wife Aggie, who is in a nursing home diagnosed with dementia. Artist Domino Whisker writes to her dad and fellow artist Charlie, whose works are owned by stars such as Bono and Stephen Soderbergh, and who has won a Grammy for his video work with Bob Dylan. Charlie was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s, and Domino cared for him until he had to move into a nursing home.

Ornagh Lee, a fitness coach, writes to her friend Dee about the challenge of dealing with the pandemic while battling with mental-health issues. And Margaret Lynch, who turned 100 in April, and has six children, 19 grandchildren and 29 great-grandchildren, writes to her newest great-grandson Daniel, who was born the day after her birthday. She can’t hold him yet, but she can tell him all about her long life and all the great events she’s lived through, including this moment in history.

 Like most of us, the nation’s top comedians have been cooped up at home over the past few weeks and months. However, those featured here haven’t let their time go to waste and have stayed busy doing what they do best: working on their schtick. Tonight, Bob Mortimer’s loud, obnoxious yuppy Train Guy comes to life in an animation, while Michael Spicer adopts his fictional adviser persona and takes on home secretary Priti Patel in the viral sensation Room Next Door. Married comedians Rachel Parris and Marcus Brigstocke perform a sensational lip sync battle, while Derek and After Life star Kerry Godliman, Hertfordshire comedian Rhys James and a few remarkable cats also put in appearances.

Hitched at Home: Our Lockdown Wedding

 Monday, Channel 4, 9pm

 Across the UK, more than 60,000 couples have seen their wedding plans dashed by the Covid-19 pandemic. As lockdown keeps loved ones apart, Fred Sirieix from First Dates gives London couple Patrick and Louise a surprise chance to get hitched in an audacious virtual celebration, with their whole wedding party watching on. With only two weeks to pull it off, Fred works around the clock to make their day as perfect as possible, dipping into his book of contacts from the worlds of celebrity and hospitality.

Isolation Stories

 Tuesday, Virgin One, 9pm

 A welcome rebroadcast of this ITV drama from last month. Aacclaimed writer Jeff Pope (Philomena) commissioned fellow scribes to devise 15-minute tales based on real events. A heavily pregnant Sheridan Smith stars as Mel, who is preparing to give birth alone. Robert Glenister and his son Tom play Ron and Russell, whose relationship becomes strained during lockdown. In Mike and Rochelle, Darren Boyd and Angela Griffin take on the roles of a hypochondriac and his psychiatrist. Finally, Eddie Marsan and his sons Blue and Brodie appear alongside David Threlfall in the story of a determined granddad.

Ireland’s world-renowned concert orchestra conductor and choirmaster is back with a new vision. Following on from The High Hopes Choir and The Choir of Ages (which documented the formation of choirs made up of members of the homeless community and of an intergenerational choir, respectively), David Brophy has formed a new choir, based in Co Wexford and made up of family carers – of which there are some 355,000 in Ireland.

The singers’ journey, filmed over the course of six months, will see them go from a group of novices to a polished, confident and capable choir. They will meet celebrity guests such as Wexford manager Davy Fitzgerald and Christy Dignam, and take on the ambitious task of composing an original song with the help of singer songwriter John Spillane, which will be premiered at a star-studded finale at the National Opera House in Wexford.

This two-part series will also look at the lives of some of the members as they care for loved ones. Participants include mother of three Jane Johnstone, who cares for her sons Evan and Daniel, who both have autism; married couple Phil and Betty Power, who care for their eldest son Jason, who has cerebral palsy; Hannah Power, who cares for her husband Patrick, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s; and Matthew and Martina McCartin, who share in the care for father and husband Eddie, who was diagnosed first with Parkinson’s and then dementia.

Highland Road Rescue – Our Lives

 Wedesday, BBC1, 7.30pm

 An intimate insight into the difficulties faced by a tight-knit family business in the Scottish Highlands. Jamie and his sister Jean run the roadside recovery company their parents began in 1973, rescuing stranded motorists from some of the wildest landscapes and challenging roads in Britain. During the busiest month of the winter, they strive day and night to rescue everything from sports cars to 42-ton trucks. It’s tough work, but they take great pride in seeing people safely on their way.

It’s hard to imagine many celebrities being given the honour of an hour-long show marking their 60th birthday. Perhaps we’ll be forced to eat our words when the likes of, say, Graham Norton or Jonathan Ross reach the milestone. Jason Manford is the presenter looking back at Bradley Walsh’s life and career, from his early showbiz days as a stand-up comedian to his appearances as a game show host and acting roles in such hit series as Coronation Street, Law & Order: UK and, most recently, Doctor Who. There’s also an amusing look at Walsh’s outtakes, fashion choices and hairstyles down the years.

Cardinal: Until the Night

 Wednesday, BBC2, 9pm

 The outstanding Canadian crime drama is getting a promotion. It has previosly aired on BBC4 but is moving to BBC2 for the fourth and last series. Billy Campbell and Karine Vanasse return as melancholic police detective John Cardinal and his trusty sidekick Lise Delorme. As Cardinal is now a widower, they’re free to act on their obvious feelings for each other, although as she’s about to receive a tempting job offer, any romance may prove short-lived. She’s sticking around long enough, however, to help him investigate the murder of a politician’s husband, who was abducted and left to die from exp||2
2020-05-31||Revenge of the experts: Will COVID-19 renew or diminish trust in science?

It is argued that COVID-19 will reverse the ongoing trend of challenging the value of science and the integrity of scientists. This column shows that exposure to epidemics in one’s country of residence during the ‘impressionable years’ of ages 18 to 25 has no impact on confidence in science as an enterprise, but negatively affects views of the honesty and public-spiritedness of scientists.

COVID-19 will change everything. (For overviews of the implications, see Benassy-Quere et al. 2020 and Benassy-Quere and Weder di Mauro 2020.) One effect, it has been argued, will be to reverse the secular trend of challenging the value of scientific expertise. “The coronavirus crisis has put a spotlight on the importance of science in supporting our nation’s well being” (Shepherd 2020). At the same time, the pandemic has put on display certain leaders’ “longstanding practice of undermining scientific expertise for political purposes” (Friedman and Plumer 2020), conceivably with negative implications for how the public views science and scientists. All of which points to the question posed by Grove (2020): “Will the coronavirus renew public trust in science?”

A further question is whether any change in public opinion will mainly affect the views of the scientific endeavour or individual scientists. Does any positive or negative reassessment of the importance and validity of science apply to both the undertaking and those engaged in it? Or does the public continue to have confidence in science as a potential source of a vaccine while dismissing individual scientists who warn that the time needed to develop that vaccine may be lengthy?

In Aksoy et al. (2020), we analyse this issue using the 2018 Wellcome Global Monitor (WGM), which includes responses to questions about confidence in science and scientists from more than 70,000 individuals in 160 countries. The responses of interest are to questions asked of all WGM respondents: “In general, would you say you trust science a lot, some, not much or not at all?” and “How much do you trust scientists” to do their work honestly, with the intention of benefiting the public? The geographical dispersion of the responses is in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Share of respondents who trust science and scientists

Notes: Panel A illustrates the share of respondents who trust science a lot or some. Panel B illustrates the share of respondents who trust scientists a lot or some. Countries are grouped in quintiles.

We use data on all global epidemics since 1970 to identify respondents who experienced an epidemic outbreak in their country of residence during their formative years, the stage of the life course when value systems and opinions are durably formed. Krosnick and Alwin (1989) formalise this as the ‘impressionable years hypothesis’ – that core attitudes, beliefs, and values crystallise between the ages of 18 and 25. Spear (2000) links this to the literature in neurology describing neurochemical and anatomical differences between the adolescent and adult brain. Giuliano and Spilimbergo (2013) show, for example, that experiencing a recession between the ages of 18 and 25 has a powerful impact on political preferences and beliefs about the economy that persists over the life cycle.

To assess the effect of past exposure to an epidemic on an individual’s trust in science and scientists, we estimate models where the dependent variable is a dummy variable indicating whether or not the respondent has confidence in science or scientists.

To operationalise our treatment variable (Exposure to epidemic, 18-25) in the paper, we calculate for each individual the number of people affected by an epidemic as a share of the population, averaged over the eight years when the individual was in his or her formative years (18-25 years old), consistent with the ‘impressionable years hypothesis’. In addition, we control for observable individual characteristics (age, gender, educational attainment, marital status, religion, and urban/rural residence), labour market outcomes, and within-country income deciles), country, year and age fixed effects, and country-specific age trends.

We find that formative-year epidemic exposure has a consistently negative and significant effect on whether the respondent has confidence in scientists; believes that scientists working for private companies benefit the public; believes that scientists working for private companies are honest; and believes that scientists working for universities are honest. An individual with the highest exposure to epidemics (0.032, that is, the number of people affected by an epidemic as a share of the population in individual’s formative years) relative to individuals with no exposure has on average 11 percentage points (-3.454*0.032) less confidence in the honesty of scientists.

In contrast, when the dependent variable concerns science as an undertaking or endeavour (“Do you have confidence in science? Will science and technology help to improve life? Is studying diseases a part of science”), the coefficients in question are instead positive, but do not differ significantly from zero. Evidently, individuals who experience epidemics at first hand retain confidence in the positive potential of science as an endeavour. They continue to believe in the importance of disease-related scientific research. But they are less confident about the trustworthiness and public-spiritedness of the individuals involved in scientific endeavors.

Given that previous work points to science education as shaping views of science and scientists, we also estimate our main specification for two subsamples: respondents who learned about science at most at the primary school level versus respondents who learned about science at least at the secondary school level. The results suggest that our findings are driven by the sample of individuals with little or no science education. It seems that science education is at least partly able to offset the adverse impact of epidemic experience on individuals’ trust in scientists.

We examined a number of sensitivity analyses to verify the robustness of the results. Placebo tests address the possibility that what we are picking up is not the impact on the perceived trustworthiness and public-spiritedness of scientists engaged in health-related research specifically, but the impact on perceptions of individuals engaged in tasks related to healthcare and health outcomes more generally. In contrast to its significant negative impact on confidence in scientists, the results indicate no significant impact on confidence in doctors and nurses, in hospitals and health clinics, in NGO workers, or in traditional healers.

We also confirmed the persistence of the impact of epidemic exposure as individuals age over time. Despite the fact that the confidence intervals around our estimates widen in smaller subsamples of rolling age windows, we confirm that epidemic exposure between the ages of 18 and 25 continues to significantly influence public perceptions in scientists’ trustworthiness and public-spiritedness even as the respondents age over time.

Lastly, the effect is insignificant when individuals are exposed to epidemics in any period other than when they are between 18 and 25 years old. These results are strongly consistent with the formative-years hypothesis, implying that the current generation experiencing COVID-19 in their formative years may end up distrusting scientists for a long period of their lives.

COVID-19 promises to reshape every aspect of society, not excluding how science is perceived. But it is not clear whether the authority of science and scientists will be enhanced or diminished, or whether such changes will affect mainly science as an endeavor or scientists as individuals.

If past epidemics are a guide, the virus will not have an impact on the regard in which science as an undertaking is held. But it will reduce confidence in individual scientists, worsen perceptions of their honesty, and weaken the belief that their activities benefit the public. The strongest impact is likely to be felt by individuals in their ‘impressionable years’, whose beliefs are in the process of being durably formed.

Responding to these trends will not be straightforward. At a minimum, our findings suggest that scientists working on public health matters and others concerned with scientific communication should think harder about how to communicate trustworthiness and honesty and, specifically, about how the generation currently in their impressionable years (‘Generation Z’) perceives such attributes. In addition, our results suggest that scientific education will help.

2020-05-31||POINTING TO where visitors will be required to step onto a disinfectant mat at the entrance, Mario De Simoni says: “We expect a lot of discipline.” Mr De Simoni is president of the Scuderie del Quirinale, a venue in Rome for big cultural events, which on June 2nd inaugurates the first major art exhibition to open since covid-19 shut galleries and museums around the world. A celebration of the Renaissance master Raphael, to coincide with the 500th anniversary of his death, the show aims to burnish the reputation of an artist once seen as greater even than Leonardo or Michelangelo. But it will also be a test of how art can be displayed in an era of social distancing.

Visitors will be admitted in groups of six every five minutes, and the aim will be to keep them two metres apart throughout. In Italy, the legally required separation is only one metre. But, says Mr De Simoni, since people will be moving around, a safety margin is advisable. The Duomo (cathedral) in Florence has opted for necklaces that flash and vibrate if the wearer gets too close to another visitor. But the Scuderie rejected them as unacceptably intrusive.

Instead, attendants will accompany, and supervise, the parties of six on their journeys through the show. As they arrive in each space, visitors will be expected to take up positions marked on the floor, and that is where difficulties could arise. Will a scholar wanting time to examine, say, the so-called Tempi Madonna and its cartoon—displayed together here for the first time—have to move on after a brief inspection? The attendants are going to need abundant tact.

Playfully entitled Raffaello 1520-1483, the exhibition begins with its subject’s early death at the age of 37 and ends with his earliest known work. The first exhibit is a replica of his tomb in the Pantheon. The last is a page containing an exquisite drawing the 14-year-old Raffaello Sanzio made of his hand, and what is probably a self-portrait.

The curators’ aim has been to show how Raphael generated his distinctive style by a process of absorption. “He was able to fuse influences from other painters in a way very few artists have managed to do,” says Eike Schmidt, the director of the Uffizi, a gallery in Florence, which contributed about a quarter of the works on display (and will open its own doors on June 3rd). Mr Schmidt loaned about a quarter of the works on display, including Raphael’s portrait of his papal patron, Leo X—a decision that prompted the resignation of the Uffizi’s entire scientific committee. Its members considered the painting too fragile to move.

Raphael’s artistic alchemy mingled the emotion in Leonardo’s exchanged glances, the athleticism of Michelangelo’s muscular nudes and the softness of Perugino’s Madonnas to create an oeuvre that, until late in the 19th century, was widely seen as greater than that of his High Renaissance contemporaries. It was only with the advent of, first, Impressionism and, subsequently, the 20th-century avant-gardes that Raphael’s mastery of representational technique began to be appreciated a tad less. This show, open until August 30th, demonstrates how that mastery still has the power to astound. Raphael was the Mozart of art, capable at the age of 22 or less of producing a work as mature and accomplished as his Young Woman with Unicorn.

Far fewer people will get to see this revealing exhibition than if the pandemic had not struck. Unless the Scuderie extends its hours (and that is under consideration), it will accommodate 800-900 visitors a day. The Scuderie’s Caravaggio show in 2010 clocked up almost 6,000.

That raises the question of how galleries and museums can survive financially on severely restricted numbers. The publicly owned Scuderie has large reserves, but Mr De Simoni admits others may respond with sharply increased entrance charges. In the covid-19 world, art, like air travel, could once more become a privilege of wealth.||2

2020-05-31||Looks like we’re going to get a full dose of government this week, some good but mostly bad.

Seems another gate has gone up to block access to pretty darned good fishing holes.

This time it’s the Orange Grove area in Terrebonne Parish.

I spent a day in these canals years ago with a young Mike Iaconelli, who qualified for the Bassmaster Classic in New Orleans while he was an amateur angler. He worked his way up from 10th place that final day to finish his first Classic in fifth place. He returned to south Louisiana a handful of years later to win the then-$500,000 Classic champion’s prize money.

This vast network has swallowed up freshwater fishermen for years, and now they are denied access by a gate.

The Louisiana Sportsmen’s Coalition stays on top of such things, and its growing number of members are fighting to keep this area from adding miles to the list of coastal and near-coast waterways denied to anglers access.

The issue appears to be the rush to permit construction of the gates, a permit approved by Terrebonne Parish’s Mart Black, the director of the parish’s Office of Coastal Restoration and Preservation.

In an alert to members, the LASC indicated its research discovered the Army Corps of Engineers never received an application for a permit to build the gates.

Furthermore, Terrebonne Parish scheduled a public hearing in March, but the meeting was, according to the LASC, “...shut down due to COVID-19 social distancing.”

The LASC further stated Black said he approved gate construction permit after receiving no negative comments.

Heavy email and telephone traffic prompted Black's response: “I support your efforts to keep fishing free and open in Terrebonne Parish. Losing these areas due to gates is costing the parish money. A solution needs to be found.

“My charge deals with impacts to vegetated wetlands under federal and state legislation, not with gates on private property. All required public notice postings were followed for this permit. The long-term solution to this can only be found in Baton Rouge with the (state) Legislature. A law should be enacted which prohibits such gates but carefully and fairly balances the needs of the property owners and the public, the fishing community."

A public meeting is set for 5 p.m. Tuesday at the Regional Military Museum, 1154 Barrow Street in Houma.

Lily Bergeron broke the ice Saturday when she became the first girl to place in the 10 years of Junior Southwest Bassmasters’ monthly tournament.

She won the 11-14 age group with a five-bass catch weighing 11.48 pounds, and had the group’s big bass, a 3.03-pounder.

Hanson Chaney came in with the heavy stringer, 14.36 pounds, to win the 15-18 age group, and Beau Smith won in the age 7-10 group with 10.49 pounds. All nine places were taken by youngsters bringing in five-bass limits.

Although they launched from the Amelia Landing, several boats worked through “no wake” zones to get into the Belle River area.

Club moderator Jim Breaux reported the top lures were spinnerbaits, crankbaits, topwater Whopper Ploppers, frogs, Sinkos, D-Bombs and crawfish imitations.
• Trusted False River reporter Sam Pernici told of the big-time catfish run on the oxbow, a catch of “...20-25 nice 13-15 inch catfish. Worms work the best, and the gnats seem to be slowing down.”
• Fishermen 15 years and younger can enter a 27th annual, and now virtual, Youth Fishing Rodeo set June 13-14 and sponsored by U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service on the Southeast Louisiana National Wildlife Refuges.

More info will come next Sunday. Youngsters will be able to fish anywhere in Louisiana, and you won’t have to register.

Menhaden — pogeys — will make a rare appearance on the Wildlife and Fisheries Commission’s agenda for its monthly meeting set for 9:30 a.m. Thursday at state Wildlife and Fisheries headquarters on Quail Drive in Baton Rouge.

Recreational fishermen and related organizations have become increasingly concerned about the millions of pounds of pogeys taken from the Atlantic for several years and, now, Gulf of Mexico waters. The fish provide forage for fish pursued by recreational anglers along with commercial species. Another concern is how many species like speckled trout, redfish and commercial species like black drum are snared in pogey nets.

Public comment likely will be held to a minimum during the return to a “live” commission meeting.

The LDWF issued this meeting advisory: “Due to the public health emergency guidelines established in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, only 25 members of the public will be allowed in the meeting room at one time. All members of the public will have to wear a mask to enter the building.”

To mitigate these rules, LWFC members agreed to ask the public to limit attendance inside the Joe Herring Room to only those agenda items of interest and to leave the room after that item has been heard to allow other members of the public to move into the room.
• A call by commission member and oyster industry representative Al Sunseri for a presentation on plans related to CARES Act funding for the state’s 2019 fisheries disaster declaration related to the opening of the Bonnet Carre Spillway and the unusually high Mississippi River.
• A report on the opening of the recreational red snapper season.
• An update on wildlife and fisheries bills in the State Legislature.

The meeting will have live audio and video streaming via Zoom with this registration: wlf-la.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_lxxnQcVyRoOZNlImQrY5Qg.

Unlike at the Zoom meeting in May, the public will not have the chance to comment on the webcast but can email public comment to Comments@wlf.la.gov. (The email must include the agenda item number in the subject of your email and must include name and address.)

U.S. Interior secretary David Bernhardt and his staff have proposed opening and/or expanding fishing and hunting opportunity on 97 national wildlife refuges and nine national fish Hatcheries. Eight of the NWRs will be open to these activities for the first time, and the move will open an additional 2.3 million acres of land and water and could bring the hunting locations up to 399 — 331 for fishing — if the proposal is enacted.

The full proposal is available on the federal website: regulations.gov. You will need the docket number: FWS-HQ-NWRS-2020-0013. There are directions to submit comments, which are due June 9.

And the winner is

How fitting is it amidst this pandemic that Lufkin, Texas nurse Scott Tomez won the B.A.S.S.-sponsored Fish With Scott Canterbury sweepstakes?

According to B.A.S.S., Tomez has spent most of the past two months working in the emergency room in a hometown hospital.

“I've never won anything like this before,” Tomez said. “After the way this year has been, winning was a huge blessing and a great surprise.”

He’ll accompany Canterbury, a national touring pro angler, on a bass fishing vacation valued at more than $52,000 to spend time on what Tomez called his “home lakes,” Sam Rayburn Reservoir in east Texas and Toledo Bend on the Louisiana-Texas border.

“(I) look forward to catching fish again,” Tomez said.||1

2020-05-31||Protecting people now, helping the economy rebound later

The public health measures to ‘flatten the Covid-19 curve' will necessarily and appropriately impose large economic costs. This column, taken from a VoxEU eBook, identifies the constraints that policy faces during a pandemic – uncertainty, time, and capacity – and the implications of these constraints.

The coronavirus is a shock to the economy the likes of which none of us has ever seen. A hurricane hitting every place in the United States, Europe, and much of the rest of the world simultaneously. And hitting every day for weeks, months, or perhaps even a year. It is partly a supply shock as workers can no longer work and supply chains get severed. It is also partly a demand shock as people will cut back their demand, not just for restaurants and travel but likely much else throughout the economy given the extreme nervousness about their economic situation. The public health measures to flatten the curve, delaying and spreading out the extent of the virus, will necessarily and appropriately impose large economic costs. The job of economic policy is, to the greatest extent possible, to protect people from those costs now and help ensure the economy is in a position to rebound quickly when the health threat is contained. Doing this will require a multifaceted and ambitious policy response.

This column is taken from the VoxEU eBook Mitigating the COVID Economic Crisis: Act Fast and Do Whatever It Takes. Download the eBook here.

Human suffering in the immediate future

The human toll will be enormous. Most profound and consequential will be the toll on health – the illnesses and deaths from COVID-19 and also the collateral damage to others from an overloaded hospital system. Less profound, but even more widespread, will be the economic toll on workers who lose their jobs or see dramatic reductions in their incomes, either directly because they work in an industry that is shut down as a result of the pandemic or indirectly because they work in anything in the economy which is seeing less demand as a result of all of the income loss and dramatically worsened outlook for the future.

The economic problems could persist well after the pandemic is contained. It would be foolish just to think of what is happening as intertemporal substitution – people not going to restaurants today but then making up for it by going to even more restaurants next year. There are four interrelated reasons why the economic problems could be very persistent:
• Labour market matching means that unemployment rates can rise sharply but not fall sharply. In the US financial crisis, for example, the unemployment rate took less than two and a half years to rise from 4.4% to 10% but, seven years to recover. The pattern is similar in previous recoveries and in other countries, and is the result of the labour market matching process in which it is hard to connect people with jobs.
• Companies will go bankrupt throughout the economy, although the extent and magnitude will depend on the policy response. In some cases, these could be disorderly bankruptcies that separate firm-specific management capital, worker capital, and a nested set of arrangements and sever all of them simultaneously. Putting that back together will not be easy.
• Financial institutions could come under tremendous strain and, absent an ambitious policy response, the economic crisis could turn into a financial crisis. Banks had substantial amounts of capital going into the crisis, including both the required levels and additional countercyclical capital buffers in many countries, but not the United States. Business credit lines have already been drawn, loans will be extended or not repaid, and funding could be increasingly difficult – all threatening to freeze up the financial system.
• The global aftershocks could also be large. Some countries may succeed in containing the virus more quickly than others. Some countries may succeed in containing the economic and financial damage associated with the economy more quickly than others. A rolling set of epidemics in individual countries and economic crises in individual countries would create global limits on travel and continue to strain global supply chains.

The first is uncertainty. Macroeconomic policy is operating under substantial uncertainty at the best of times, given the impossibility of definitive evidence from randomised control trials and the fact that the key structural parameters of the economy are likely fluctuating over time. Now it is operating under massive uncertainty given that we do not know the duration of the pandemic, the duration of the steps that are being taken to flatten the curve, the effect all of these will have on the economy, and how economic policies work in this situation.

The second is time. The change in economic activity has been larger and more abrupt than anything anyone has ever experienced on a global basis. The US housing bubble peaked in 2006, European financial institutions started to have problems in the summer of 2007, economic activity slowed over the course of 2007 in the United States, Bear Stearns needed to be rescued in March 2008, and Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008. At times events went quickly, but for the most part the economic situation unfolded slowly. In contrast, each day brings more news about the pandemic and more news about economic closures. Policies that are operational as quickly as possible are necessary.

The third constraint is capacity. During the financial crisis, government employees showed up at their jobs; now many are teleworking and likely all will be soon. Many are scared and distracted by the spread of the virus. Some will get sick and die, or if they do not will care for and grieve for others who do. All of this applies to the people developing policies in places like legislatures, finance ministries and central banks. It also applies to the people implementing the policies. At the best of times it is hard to implement administratively complex new policies. And these are not the best of times.

These constraints have six implications:
• Better to do too much rather than too little. The current situation is one of radical uncertainty. And given this radical uncertainty, policy has to be based on a risk analysis of the cost of doing too little and the cost of doing too much. In this case the risk analysis is increasingly clear: the cost of doing too much is the time value of money, which right now is negative given the negative real interest rates. The cost of doing too little could potentially be enormous both in terms of immediate human suffering and a prolonged economic crisis that exceeds the one in the wake of the global financial crisis.
• Use existing mechanisms as much as possible. Franklin D. Roosevelt engaged in “bold and persistent experimentation” in combatting the Great Depression. This process unfolded over a decade. We do not want to be combatting the economic fallout of the pandemic over the course of a decade. Increase funds under existing channels of assistance rather than creating new ones; repeat policies that have been tried and worked (at least administratively) in the past.
• Invent new programmes where necessary. It will not be possible to use existing mechanisms for everything. The United States, for example, does not have paid leave or mandatory sick days so needs to invent and implement them in the middle of the pandemic. No country has sufficient mechanisms to deal with abrupt revenue stops in a large number of sectors across the economy.
• Diversify and do not fear duplication or unintended ‘winners’ in the response. Given the uncertainty about the economic situation, the impact of policies, and the new policies that are being invented, it is worth diversifying the response. Many policies will have to be tried. Some will work; others will not. Many will be wasteful, giving money to people or businesses that do not need it – or even giving it to the same ones twice. The risk of duplication is much smaller than the risk of over-targeting that leaves many out.
• Enlist the private sector as much as possible. The private sector will be operating under many of the same operational constraints as the government. But it has an existing infrastructure, can be nimble, and can form a diversification of the response. Direct government lending is hard, but loan guarantees can enlist the private sector to make the loans. The private sector will make the additional food and hospital equipment but will need financial incentives. Some will end up making a profit out of all of this, now is not the time to be squeamish.
• Ensure the response is dynamic and persistent. The damage is uncertain. It may vary across places. It may last a long time. Policy needs to be ready to stay in place and even grow in the places and times it is needed. The more that policies can have triggers to automatically continue and expand in places and times they are needed, the better.

What a policy response should look like

The exact policy response will vary from country to country but here are some ways to operationalise the principles above:
• Spare no expense on health. Testing, hospital systems, antiviral and vaccine research and anything else that is needed should be funded.
• Targeted assistance using existing programmes. In the United States this means expanding eligibility for unemployment insurance (although that is hard because eligibility rules vary across the 50 states and the District of Columbia), increasing the amount of benefits ($50 per week added), and expanding other programmes for the most vulnerable, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). In addition, increasing federal funding for states is critical and one of the best mechanisms for this. The United States is increasing the share of Medicaid paid by the federal government.
• Cash payments to households. M||1

Maubeuge (France) (AFP) - Thousands of workers rallied Saturday outside the Renault factory in northern France to protest the automaker's decision to cut 15,000 jobs worldwide, including 4,600 in France.

Unions said 8,000 people took part in the protest at the Maubeuge subsidiary over the cuts designed to help Renault steer out of a cash crunch exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.

The plant, which employs around 2,100 people, has been stopped since Friday.

Under the new plan, Maubeuge-based production of electric Kangoo utility vehicles is set to move to Douai, 70 kilometres (45 miles) away, much to the consternation of workers.

"It's an earthquake that is taking place. We want to keep our company here," Jerome Delvaux, a union member, told AFP.

"This demonstration today is very important, even if it is a first step, to show the government and Renault that workers and residents of this area are committed to this company and that we have support," Delvaux added.

"We need these jobs, otherwise it's a whole territory that will die," he said.

The company will target savings of more than two billion euros ($2.2 billion) over three years and turn its focus to electric vehicles as it seeks to restore competitiveness in a market reeling from slumping sales since the COVID-19 pandemic forced millions of people into home confinement for weeks on end.

Renault had been navigating turbulent waters even before the health crisis, starting with the shock arrest of its former boss Carlos Ghosn on financial misconduct charges in 2018 which led to deep rifts in its alliance with Japanese partners Nissan and Mitsubishi.

In February, the company unveiled its first annual loss in a decade, followed quickly by the 2020 health crisis that saw new car registrations in the European Union plunge 76.3 percent year-on-year in April.

In an "adjustment" plan announced to unions Thursday, Renault said nearly 4,600 jobs would be cut out of 48,000 in France, and more than 10,000 in the rest of the world -- some eight percent of the company's global workforce.

It would entail retraining, internal mobility and voluntary departures, spread out over three years, with no outright dismissals envisioned for now.

Four production sites in France could be closed or restructured, the automaker said, and its hulking factory at Flins northwest of Paris will stop making the Zoe electric hatchback from 2024.||0
2020-05-30||Friday the 13th is consistently anticipated to be an eventful day among horror film fanatics and the subtly superstitious, but it is also a significant day in tattoo shops across the country. Sailors believed that tattooing the traditionally unlucky number 13 on their bodies would deter bad luck from following them, which encouraged others to flaunt the symbol with simple, spooky designs. Dallas tattoo artist Oliver Peck turned this trend into an event in the ‘90s and tattoo shops have been celebrating the mystic day with special events and mysteriously low prices — typically, $13 mysterious — since.

Ironically, Friday the 13th was the last time Durham’s Welcome Tattoo shop was operating normally.

The March 13 event was supposed to be a party — the owners booked Wonderpuff to serve gourmet cotton candy and planned giveaways for those who joined the gathering. The festivities, however, were quickly adapted to address the rising concerns about COVID-19 in the state. The owners modified this notoriously-crowded celebration into a first-come, first-served flash event. Clients could choose a piece of palm-sized flash for $130, and all proceeds went toward the nonprofit of the client’s choice. Welcome Tattoo maintained the artistry and convenient prices of each Friday the 13th, but sacrificed its electric atmosphere to protect the Durham community.

“We already clean a lot, as you can imagine,” owner Morgan Grimm said. “We just became extra aware of cleanliness, wiping down clipboards and door handles after every customer. We limited the number of people allowed in the shop at one time and only let in people who were actually being tattooed.”

Lively and inviting energy is necessary for a tattoo shop — even if buzzing needles and blood-stained gloves threaten your bravado, there is comfort in the echoing post-grunge playlists and muffled admiration for wall-hung collages. The dying vivacity within the tattoo shop was indicative of the impending shutdown. The shop voluntarily closed their doors two days later.

“It all happened so fast. We went from not hearing about anything coronavirus-related to being affected by it overnight,” Grimm said. “We felt that closing was the best thing to do for our community at the time.”

A week after Welcome Tattoo closed, Gov. Roy Cooper ordered personal care and grooming services to close by March 25 at 5 p.m. All barber shops, hair, nail, and beauty salons and massage and tattoo parlors were shut down due to their inability to provide service while social distancing. These businesses are dependent on in-person contact, and, as a result, are desperately struggling through the COVID-19 crisis. Restaurants and retail shops are undeniably experiencing financial losses, but they can still partially operate under current conditions. Tattoo artists, on the other hand, cannot deliver their product to your doorstep.

“I feel like [tattoo shops], nail techs, hairdressers, massage therapists, a lot of those in-person services are just in a complete standstill,” Grimm expressed. “There is really not much that can be done until we see a decline in cases.”

In addition to losing a steady source of revenue, many new businesses have not been operating long enough to qualify for small business loans. One-year-old Welcome Tattoo, too new to obtain such loans, has utilized creative methods of bringing in money. Grimm explained how one tattooer, Kohen Meyers, has been creating and selling his artwork in an unpromising attempt to earn an income as the pandemic prohibits his livelihood. The shop also hosted a raffle in which the winner would receive a free original flash design — designs that typically cost anywhere from $100 to $500.

Amid selling merchandise and hosting raffles for the shop, Welcome Tattoo’s main focus has been promoting other small businesses in Durham.Their Instagram page kindly pushes followers to donate to the Triangle Restaurant Workers Relief Fund for the chance to win a free flash tattoo.

“Right when we closed we did a big raffle for the Triangle Restaurant Workers Relief Fund. We realized we’re not the only ones going through this,” Grimm explained. “I think Durham has always been great about supporting local businesses, so it is nice that we can continue to do that.”

Ultimately, small businesses are depending on the support of consumers — their neighbors — to stay afloat. It may seem inconvenient to scope out a local business carrying the products you want instead of visiting your preferred cookie-cutter capitalist wonderland, but shopping small benefits the entire community. Not to mention, locally created products — from Pincho Loco’s refreshing ice cream to Heavenly Buffaloes’ late-night greasy satisfaction — allows customers to explore the city through innovative, artistic products crafted by people passionate about their work. They’re working for you. And right now, they need you more than ever.

“Buy from local shops and local restaurants as much as possible. Buy from them instead of Amazon or a major chain store. We’ve been buying groceries from our neighbor Accordion Club,” Grimm said. “What’s really important is that financial support. If you’re not able to financially support, then share what those businesses are doing with your friends and family on social media to help bring in customers.”

As a writer and reporter, I would typically end this article with some drawn-out moral message that I can only hope resonates with each reader. But as someone who loves and misses the Durham community, I would much rather ask you to support the local businesses and people that complete the Durham experience, even if your experience only lasts four years. Now is not the time to pretend I have some profound wisdom to share. If you are able to, please shop small. Shop local. Shop Durham.||2
2020-05-30||SEATTLE -- Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan announced a city-wide curfew from 5:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. for Saturday and Sunday, May 30 and 31 after chaos broke out downtown.

“While most of those protests were peaceful, there have been isolated but significant events of violence and destruction. This temporary curfew is intended to preserve the health and safety of our residents by keeping our streets safe and accessible for essential workers and first responders and preventing the further spread of COVID-19,” said Mayor Durkan.

"The curfew is intended to prevent violence and widespread property damage, and to prevent the further community spread of COVID-19 through continued gathering," the city wrote in a news release.

"The temporary curfew does not impact people who need to commute to work during these hours, people experiencing homelessness, people in a medical emergency or people in a dangerous situation, first responders, health care workers, and the news media. In addition, the curfew does not require businesses to close while it is in effect, and it will not alter public transit schedules."

Gov. Jay Inslee late Saturday announced that he activated up to 200 members of the National Guard. That was in response to a request from the city of Seattle to help manage a chaotic scene in downtown.

Multiple police cars were set on fire and destroyed near Westlake Center.

"The National Guard is on stand by to assist the Seattle Police Department as requested by Mayor Durkan," Inslee said. "They will be unarmed and assist with infrastructure protection and crowd movement. They will only be utilized if absolutely necessary and we appreciate their efforts to help in this important work."

Inslee said the guard personnel will be unarmed and be directed by Seattle officials, who requested the help to protect property and manage crowds who had gathered in response to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Thousands of people gathered in downtown Seattle to protest the killing of George Floyd and a largely peaceful gathering turned rowdier Saturday afternoon.

Police deployed flash bangs and pepper-sprayed some demonstrators who got close to police lines. Police on bicycles pushed back several protesters.

A police spokeswoman, Sgt. Lauren Truscott, said some people were arrested though she didn’t have an exact figure.

The Washington State Patrol closed both directions of Interstate 5 through downtown Seattle as a protest over the killing of George Floyd spilled onto the freeway Saturday afternoon.

"The freeway is not a safe or appropriate place for demonstration,” state patrol Chief John Batiste said in a statement.

2020-06-01||Good morning, it’s June 1, 2020, a Monday morning perhaps like no other in the history of our republic. A hundred cities waking up to broken glass on the sidewalks, burned-out buildings, vulgar and threatening graffiti sprayed on buildings and streets. All this while a pandemic that has claimed 106,000 Americans remains unchecked. With most of the strictures that crashed the U.S. economy -- closing stadiums, museums, theaters, amusement parks, and basically the entire service sector -- still in place. Amid it all, none these interlocking crises have made our leading civic institutions any less partisan, apparently, and that includes the media.

Remember when social media was touted as an innovation that would help bring human beings together? Do you recall when the 24-hour news cycle was envisioned as a technological advancement that would keep Americans better informed?

Well, social media can bring people together. And it does, every day. The platforms can also be used to recruit terrorists, foreign and domestic. Likewise, cable news has the wherewithal to keep citizens better informed, but there are business considerations at play that mitigate the good, along with human considerations: political bias, personal pettiness, and the pressures of competition.

It was 40 years ago today that Ted Turner launched Cable News Network. In a moment I’ll offer an observation about this seminal development. First, I’d point you to RealClearPolitics’ front page, which presents our poll averages, videos, breaking news stories, and aggregated opinion pieces spanning the political spectrum. We also offer original material from our own reporters and contributors, including the following:

CNN’s first challenge, of course, was to be profitable. By the time of its launch, founder Ted Turner didn’t need the money -- he was a billionaire when that was rare -- but it needed to attract enough viewers and advertisers to justify the tremendous cost of fielding news crews around the country and the world, support a vigorous Washington bureau, and a home base in Atlanta.

Skeptics abounded. Was there even enough news? A New Yorker cartoon from the early days illustrated the problem: It depicted a dead bird, its feet in the air, with a CNN camera crew on the spot. “A sparrow falls,” read the caption, “and CNN goes live.”

In truth, those at the network’s creation knew right away they were on to something. Three days before the its launch, civil rights leader Vernon Jordan had been wounded in an attempted assassination. On June 1, President Jimmy Carter visited Jordan in the hospital -- and spoke to CNN’s cameras as he emerged.

“You know,” CNN script copy editor Randy Harber thought to himself, “this is going to work.”

Sometimes, it worked too well, such as on Jan. 28, 1986 when the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded in midair, and CNN anchors and correspondents found themselves trying to explain to Americans, including many children, why six astronauts and a popular schoolteacher were never coming home to their loved ones.

A milestone event came during the Persian Gulf War. By then, CNN had been meeting the challenge of live, 24-hour television for a decade, and proving itself up to the task. The established networks broke into their regular programming when the shooting started, but only CNN had a team on the scene at Baghdad’s Rashid Hotel when the airstrikes began.

In a free country, success will spawn imitators, and so it was with CNN. By 1989, Europe’s Sky News was on the air 24 hours a day and by the mid-1990s Rupert Murdoch -- who owned Sky News -- decided to give CNN a run for its money. Fox News Channel promised even higher production values than its rival, and something else as well: an ideological correction. “Fair and balanced” was the slogan coined by Roger Ailes, but this was said with a wink and a nod. What it really meant was that Fox News was going to offer ballast in a media marketplace dominated by liberal sensibilities. At first, CNN ignored the usurper, even as conservatives took to trolling CNN as the “Clinton News Network.”

Eventually, as Fox News consistently attracted more viewers than CNN and upstart MSNBC combined, a change of heart occurred. In the presidential 2012 campaign, MSNBC had emerged as the liberal alternative -- it was the Barack Obama network, if you will. Later, many observers would still view CNN as pro-Clinton even though a different Clinton was running for president. And Fox News remained reliably Republican in its orientation.

By 2013, none of this could be ignored. Writing in Politico, media critic Dylan Byers began an analysis of the problem with a provocative opening sentence aimed at the D.C. chattering class: “This is the quickest way to turn a pleasant dinner party into a shouting match: Posit that MSNBC is not as bad as Fox News, but rather worse than Fox News.”

Objectively, MSNBC was by then much worse than Fox, if one believes the mission of the news business is to offer facts rather than propaganda. An exhaustive Pew Research Center Study done earlier that year showed the 85% of MSNBC’s programming was devoted to opinion and only 15% to reporting. At Fox, the ratio was much better -- 55% opinion, and 45% news. CNN hadn’t yet reached the 50% tipping point, but it was getting close. By the time of Donald Trump’s election, it would -- without ever admitting it -- throw in the towel and join the Resistance.

On Sunday, as the NYPD tried to quell riots, CNN President Jeff Zucker let it slip that he is thinking of running for mayor of New York. Although this speculation isn’t new, it set off the predictable kvetching in conservative circles. You know, about Mike Bloomberg’s conflicts of interest as the founder-of-Bloomberg-News-turned-mayor-turned-2020-Democratic-presidential-candidate. And about whether the Democratic Party would owe Zucker back pay -- that sort of thing. But this critique misses the mark. The great British journalist Charles Prestwich Scott was a liberal member of Parliament before assuming ownership and editorship of the Manchester Guardian. But the man still knew what a news outlet was for.

Ninety-nine years ago this spring, he penned an essay long considered the gold standard for independent journalism. The primary goal of the media, Scott asserted, was accurate reporting. “Comment is free,” he wrote, “but facts are sacred.”||0
2020-06-01||DILLON — Restaurants across the state were allowed to open at 50% capacity on Wednesday, May 27, in a step toward the reopening process after the full COVID-19 shutdown. Dining establishments throughout Summit County opened their patios and half of their restaurants to guests. While there were some visitors, patrons were mostly cooped-up locals eager to dine-in at their favorite restaurants.

Castaways Cove Kitchen Manager Kaleb Anderson said that most of the people who came to the restaurant’s reopening day Thursday were those who have routinely supported the restaurant prior to and during the shutdown. Anderson said that hopefully the reopening of hotels will drum up more business as well since this has been a draw for local restaurants in the past.

Despite the new protocols in place, Anderson said things around the restaurant aren’t “too terribly different” aside from that the restaurant is spending more money on gloves, Anderson joked, and taking the time to come up with new recipes. He said Castaways Cove currently has about 75% of its original staff and will eventually bring everyone back.

“It was pretty good, a little quiet, but we saw a lot of our regulars that came back for the first day which was great to see,” owner Bonnie Lehman said.

Like other restaurants that are currently reopening, Arapahoe Cafe has posted their new protocols and guest requirements on their website, which include the requirement that guests wear masks upon entering the restaurant or patio and that “everything a customer might have touched will be sanitized after every use.”

The cafe has a patio that allows for 6 feet of distancing between tables and has been preferred by guests — both for comfort during the pandemic as well as in the wake of warm spring weather. Lehman said it is an adjustment to have tables in the dining room and the pub 6 feet apart as employees are used to having a packed restaurant, but that the restaurant is always under strict protocols from the health department, making additional sanitation efforts fairly easy to work in.

“It’s actually been an easier adjustment than we kind of thought it would be,” Lehman said. “I think the biggest thing is the employees adjusting to wearing a mask the whole shift … but outside of that, the sanitation policies we put in place have been fairly easy to kind of just work into our normal routines of being at work, so that’s been pretty easy.”

Lehman said a timer goes off every 30 minutes reminding employees to perform their recurring sanitation duties, such as sanitizing bathrooms, point-of-sale systems and other commonly touched spaces, surfaces and objects. Lehman also noted that the restaurant has seen a mix of locals and visitors who are up for the day or who are camping over the course of the first few days of being open. Lehman said she expects to see more visitors once hotels open. The restaurant is still seeing a fair amount of to-go orders as well.

As for filling the restaurant to capacity, Lehman said Arapahoe Cafe will reach their 50% limit during certain rushes, such as dinnertime in the pub, but that people clear out after the rush.

“We’re just waiting for the next wave of reopenings, if we can open to 75% … but until then we’re just happy to have customers in the building,” Lehman said.

Lehman said she was able to bring back all of her winter staff and is preparing to bring on more staff for the summer as is the restaurant’s typical strategy.

Columbine Cafe opened its doors right away on Wednesday. Owner Robert Simonton said business is “gradually picking up” as the days go on and compared the current state of the cafe to that of past mud seasons. Simonton said he has had mainly locals come in so far to eat at physically distanced tables set up inside and four tables outside.

While outside tables have filled up, Simonton said he has yet to fill up for both indoor and outdoor seating. Simonton said things aren’t too much different aside from how the inside of the restaurant looks with separating tarps set up. He echoed Lehman’s sentiment that restaurants like his already have fairly rigorous sanitation procedures in place, so amping this element up isn’t a major change.

“Restaurants are pretty much one of the cleanest places you’ll go to,” Simonton said.||2

2020-06-01||Art Green introduces the Oxfam Trailwalker campaign, which is being held in Taranaki in 2021.

A large charity walking and running event is to be held in Taranaki for the next three years.

The Oxfam Trailwalker, which raises money for Oxfam's humanitarian work, will be held in New Plymouth from 2021.

The first Taranaki event, which usually attracts about 1000 entrants, as well as 1500 supporters, will be held from March 20-21.

First held in 2006, teams of four cover 50km in 18 hours or 100km in 36 hours together - it is not a relay.

 * Records fall at Oxfam's 100km fundraiser race



The 2020 event, which was to be held in Whakatāne for the fifth and final year, was cancelled due to Covid-19.

Following a tender process with pitches from councils across the country, Taranaki was chosen on a number of criteria, including the variety of landscape and the accessibility from Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.

But it is not a highest-bid process, Oxfam said.

In a statement, New Plymouth mayor Neil Holdom said the event would be a major boost to the region as it recovers from the coronavirus-induced economic downturn.

"It’s another major event in our beautiful region as we continue to build a lifestyle capital and it will be a superb showcase for our wonderful corner of Aotearoa."

Venture Taranaki chief executive Justine Gilliland said the event will bring a significant boost to the Taranaki economy.

Oxfam New Zealand executive director Rachael Le Mesurier said they hoped the Taranaki community would enjoy being part of it.

"We are delighted with the support of our Taranaki hosts, as the spirit of local hospitality and encouragement will make all the difference as hundreds of walkers set out to challenge poverty over 50 or 100 kilometres.

"We also look forward to seeing many Taranaki locals stepping out on the start line or supporting in some other way, as we make history with the first Oxfam Trailwalker in the region."

The event typically raises close to a million dollars each year to support projects in the Pacific and around the world.

This will now include providing support to those hit doubly hard by poverty and the coronavirus pandemic.||2
2020-06-01||After her university closed in March, Jeannine Randall sat down to adapt her research plan for a pandemic. Her project to monitor tree swallows through the spring and summer with a team of three scientists would now require travelling to the nesting sites in separate vehicles, using individual work kits, staying 2 metres apart and, of course, sanitizing regularly. When she realized hand sanitizer was in short supply in shops, she made her own batch using ethanol from her lab.

Now, as her school, the University of Northern British Columbia in Prince George, Canada, resumes some services, she is putting the plan into action: counting eggs, waiting for hatchlings and watching the birds from daybreak to sundown. “I think scientists are very well placed in some ways to come up with a protocol that makes sense and then follow it,” says Randall, an avian ecologist.

As countries around the world begin lifting pandemic lockdowns, researchers are entering a new phase of work — donning masks with their lab coats, staggering hours in laboratory spaces and taking shifts on shared instruments. Some universities have created detailed plans to track and test staff, and many have limited the capacity of indoor spaces and the flow of people through hallways and entrances. For others, post-lockdown plans are still taking shape. And whereas some universities have worked in lockstep with governments to formulate safety plans, others have charted their own paths.

Cull, release or bring them home: Coronavirus crisis forces hard decisions for labs with animals

University associations in the United States estimate that research there will need a boost of at least US$26 billion to get back up to speed. Among them, the Association of American Universities in Washington DC is drafting a set of priorities for university leaders to consider as they tackle reopening.

Of more than 3,000 researchers who responded to an online Nature reader poll last month, just under half said that they are still on lockdown. Following national policy trends, scientists in the United Kingdom, United States and Brazil were among the most likely to report restrictions, whereas only about 7% of those from Germany did (see ‘Getting back to business’). “Now, we are mostly back to normal, apart from wearing face masks and having to maintain a certain distance between each other,” says Boyan Garvalov, a cancer researcher at Heidelberg University, who juggles his career with monitoring his kids’ online learning. He currently splits time at home with his spouse, trading shifts at work.

Gloves and masks at all times

In Italy, which was hit particularly hard early in the global pandemic, nearly 30% of roughly 90 respondents to the Nature poll say that they have returned to work, and another 18% report having worked throughout lockdowns. One of these is cell biologist Paolo Bernardi, who went into the University of Padua nearly every working day to oversee a skeleton staff and teach his pathophysiology class over Zoom. “Now we are seeing better days,” Bernardi says. His lab is at about 50% capacity. University guidelines for resuming work, in effect since 26 April, require distances of 1 metre between people in brief contact, increased to 2 metres for those occupying the same room for more than 15 minutes; masks are to be worn at all times and gloves are compulsory in the lab. Capacity is limited to three people to a room, conference rooms are closed and meetings must still take place through calls or videoconferencing. Bernardi is comfortable with the university’s balance of safety and flexibility.

A year without conferences? How the coronavirus pandemic could change research

At the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, researchers have been asked to avoid working with hazardous chemicals when they can, to minimize the risk of spills that would require medical attention, according to Jana Volaric, a synthetic organic chemist. But for her, the biggest impact is the diminished conference schedule. She had hoped to be networking in anticipation of being on the job market next year, and she says that meaningful interactions are harder to come by at online conferences. “This is the most disappointing part.”

‘Singing from the same song sheet’

Organic chemist Kirsty Anderson lost about four weeks of work when the University of Auckland in New Zealand closed down along with the rest of the country. It reopened partially a few weeks ago, and instituted many of the restrictions seen in Europe. But it also required people who entered the building to mark their time of entry and location on timesheets, and maintain a distance of 2 metres between people at all times. With lift access restricted to one person at a time, she often climbed the seven flights of stairs to get to the lab. With more services opening in mid-May, the check-in database is now online.

She and her colleagues are taking odd- and even-hour rotations at their office desks to meet the university’s spacing requirements. Shared instruments such as the nuclear magnetic resonance and mass-spectroscopy tools are run by designated operators to minimize contact — Anderson hands over samples, wiped before drop-off, and sends codes and instructions through a shared online document.

How countries are using genomics to help avoid a second coronavirus wave

Winston Byblow, a neuroscientist who studies motor function after strokes at the University of Auckland, says the government and university are united in their safety messaging and pandemic response. “Everyone is singing from the same song sheet,” he says. He’s worried, however, that experiments with human participants might take a hit for a while. People are going to be wary about taking part in trials for many months, because of concerns about being in enclosed spaces with others, he says. “If recruitment rates drop because of uncertainty or fear, then it just means that it’s going to take a lot longer to complete the research, and that comes at a cost.”

Other universities are striking out on their own. Jorge Huete-Pérez is a molecular biologist and vice-president at the University of Central America in Managua, a private university with about 8,000 students. The institution formulated its own lockdown plan — reducing the number of people on campus by about 90% — independent of the Nicaraguan government, which put in place no measures to mitigate the virus’s spread. The pandemic arrived late in Central America, and reports put the total number of cases in Nicaragua at less than 800. But Huete-Pérez thinks the real number is higher, more in step with or perhaps higher than the 1,000 cases reported in neighbouring Costa Rica, and roughly 5,000 in Honduras. “We don’t really know the real dimensions of the COVID situation,” he says. When it is time reopen, in the absence of guidelines from the Nicaraguan government, he anticipates that he will look to independent medical organizations and the WHO, to inform the university’s plan.

To set coronavirus policy, model lives and livelihoods in lockstep

In the United States, as the presidential administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clashed over the plan for a post-pandemic return to work, the University of California, San Diego, drafted a detailed one of its own, including an ambitious screening and testing regime for staff and students, to come into effect in the autumn, that relies on campus labs to process samples. The pilot phase, begun on May 11, tested more than 1,000 students and ended last week.

But that approach is something of an anomaly. In the United States, policies and priorities can differ drastically between states. “The situation is changing pretty rapidly and the stakes are very high,” says Peter Schiffer, a physicist and former vice-provost for research at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who is a senior fellow at the AAU. A number of universities have adjusted their schedules or delayed students’ return to campus until next year, but have yet to firm up plans for researchers.

The logistics are unparalleled says Tobin Smith, vice-president for policy at the AAU. “This is all new territory.”||2

FROM DEAGU in South Korea to Qom in Iran, Mulhouse in France and Sacramento in California, places of collective worship have often been accelerators of coronavirus contagion. Months later, with lockdowns starting to ease in the rich world, some religious groups have been loudly demanding a return to normality, and complaining that their needs have been forgotten.

In France houses of worship have opened earlier than planned because of a successful appeal by conservative religious groups to the Council of State, the highest administrative court. And the High Court in London has agreed to hear an appeal from a mosque leader in Bradford, a stronghold of Islam, who says stopping Friday prayers curbed his religious liberty.

The clash between religious and secular authority is felt most keenly in America. On May 29th the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to reject an appeal from a church in California, South Bay United Pentecostal, against restrictions imposed by the state’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom. Conservative court members saw merit in the church’s complaint that the constitutional right to free exercise of religion was being violated, but they were overruled. Often President Donald Trump’s administration has sided with churches in disputes with local or state authorities seeking to enforce stay-at-home orders. On May 22nd Mr Trump demanded the re-opening of churches, deeming them “essential”.

Covid-19 has exacerbated not only tension between churches and states, but also disagreements between different religious tendencies. Religious figures have denounced one another, either for being too reckless or for being too meekly compliant with government orders.

These disputes may be a symptom of a wider phenomenon. In the words of Austen Ivereigh, a biographer of Pope Francis, the virus has “deepened existing fault-lines and exposed a few new ones” in the realm of religion. For example, he says, some believers see in the covid crisis a deadly threat to religious liberty; others dismiss that view. Those fault-lines are particularly evident in liberal-democratic countries where practising religion of any kind or style, or firmly rejecting religion, is an open choice, not a default mode.

To understand the biggest chasm, imagine two camps that are defined by what they fear and dislike most. In one are religious groups whose strongest impulse is to improve the material lot of humanity, by fighting poverty or pollution. They are open to working with secular agencies, including governments and supra-national bodies, where they can be a force for the common good. In the other camp, faith communities believe the main challenge is secularism, the watering-down of old certainties, the threat posed by new thinking about sex and gender—all perceived evils deemed to be perpetrated by liberal elites and secular government authorities.

The fault-line does not neatly separate religions; it often divides denominations. Take the split in Catholic ranks. In his response to the pandemic, Pope Francis reaffirmed his preference for the more humanitarian camp by establishing a high-level panel to advise not just on the disease itself but also on the challenges that will follow: unemployment, strained welfare budgets, the need for new definitions of economic value. On May 31st he marked the feast of Pentecost by leading a sparse, mask-wearing flock in prayers in St Peter’s Square; he urged special concern for the world’s vulnerable, including the indigenous people of the Amazon, “that they may not lack health care.” The readmission of a well-policed crowd marked some relief from the empty expanse which Francis faced seven weeks earlier at Easter.

Yet the pope’s declared opponents, including Raymond Burke, an American cardinal, have redoubled their attacks on him for being too compliant with worldly authorities which may have dark agendas. In chastising restrictions preventing the faithful from going to mass, Cardinal Burke wrote: “We cannot simply accept the determinations of secular governments, which would treat the worship of God in the same manner as going to a restaurant or to an athletic contest.” He has also aligned himself with conspiracy theorists in suggesting that the virus might lead to compulsory vaccines or even the subcutaneous microchipping of people by an all-controlling state.

To a degree the divide splits Europe and America, in part because of their differing collective memories. Americans abhor state-imposed religious orthodoxy, whereas Europeans have a theocratic tradition whose current form is emollient. The humanitarian camp is much stronger in Europe, at least among established Christian hierarchies. Bishops have raised few objections to locked-down churches, but they have weighed in on social and political issues. In Britain, for example, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, the head of England’s established church, warned the government against returning to austerity to repay the fast-rising pile of public debt. Several other bishops openly rebuked Dominic Cummings, a prime-ministerial adviser who made a long road-trip during a lockdown.

In some European countries, observers have seen a subtle Christian influence in policy responses to the virus, always working with the grain of the liberal state, not against it. In Germany, for example, theologians have taken part in a commission that pondered how to allocate medical resources in an acute crisis: it concluded that a person’s ability to recover—but not age itself—should be a criterion.

On both the secular and religious right in the United States, by contrast, the argument has sometimes been made that saving the old and vulnerable should not always take priority over saving the economy, or simply practising religion. Rusty Reno, editor of an influential religious journal, First Things, made waves by arguing that it was un-Christian to focus too much on avoiding death. “There are many things more precious than life. And yet we have been whipped into such a frenzy in New York that most family members will forgo visiting sick parents,” he complained, in a much-contested editorial.

On May 11th he tweeted that wearing masks was tantamount to “enforced cowardice”. That prompted Rod Dreher, another widely read pundit, to describe his fellow conservative’s utterance as “contemptible”. Mr Reno subsequently withdrew the tweet and apologised. Meanwhile, in California an influential Orthodox priest, Josiah Trenham, has rejoiced in recent days over the widespread “civil disobedience” by the state’s churches which was, in his view, forcing the governor to retreat from a “large, unjustified over-reach of the civil authority” in curbing the practice of faith.

These “theocon” objections to the lockdowns have been advanced on roughly three grounds: that they damage the economy, that public worship is more important than anything else people do, and that human freedom to do anything at all is being unfairly restricted. Such things would be hard to say in Europe. One of the many reasons for that, according to religion-watchers, is the European reading of Christianity, especially in the post-1945 era when the continent’s leading thinkers, secular and religious, have had a horror of any attitude that favoured cold economic or ideological calculation over basic decency.

Among Europe’s Christian Democrats, like those who dominate German politics, this religious influence is acknowledged in varying degrees. And even Scandinavian social democracy, on the face of things a godless creed, has clear historic roots in the region’s Lutheran tradition which emphasises good citizenship, says Nick Spencer of Theos, a London think-tank. For pious traditionalists, that Nordic example is a warning, not an inspiration: wherever religion merges with social welfare, they would retort, it virtually ceases to exist.

Still, not all religious disputes have got worse. One of the pandemic’s surprises is that traditional faith communities, as well as newfangled ones, have responded creatively to the need for new forms of worship. In one German town, a Catholic priest and a female Lutheran minister experimented with a drive-in service where people could enjoy the singing and preaching through their car radios. To a traditionalist Catholic, this mixing of sexes, denominations and rites breaks every rule of church order. But plainly some of the faithful like it, and they may want more.||1
2020-06-02||Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Adam Fortais had never attended a virtual conference. Now he’s sold on them — and doesn’t want to go back to conventional, in-person gatherings.

That’s because of his experience of helping to instigate some virtual sessions for the March meeting of the American Physical Society (APS), after the organization cancelled the regular conference at short notice. “If given the option, I think I would almost always choose to do the virtual one,” says Fortais, a physicist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. “It just seems better to me in almost all ways.”

Fortais could get his wish. Since the coronavirus spread worldwide in early March, many scientific conferences scheduled for the first half of the year have migrated online, and organizers of meetings due to take place in the second half of 2020 are deciding whether they will go fully or partially virtual. Some researchers hope that the pandemic will finally push scientific societies to embrace a shift towards online conferences — a move that many scientists have long desired for environmental reasons and to allow broader participation.

Scientists with disabilities and parents of young children are just two examples of the researchers who are benefiting from online meetings, says Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. Cobb has been cutting back her own air travel since 2017, both to reduce her personal carbon footprint and to blaze a trail towards structural change in her discipline. She hopes the changes as a result of the pandemic will last long after it has ended. “In five years, we’ll be in a remarkably different place.”

But other researchers say that in-person conferences will once again dominate after the threat of COVID-19 has faded. For them, in-person meetings offer too many opportunities that virtual meetings can’t replicate.

Estimates of the carbon cost of conferences vary, but range from 0.5 to 2 or more tonnes of carbon dioxide per participant in travel alone. If each of the estimated 7.8 million researchers in the world travelled to one conference every year, the lower bound of the annual carbon emissions would be roughly equivalent to those of some small nations.

Sputnik moment or budget breaker: How will the pandemic alter research funding?

Before the pandemic, many scientific societies had already begun exploring how to make virtual participation available for researchers who were unable or unwilling to travel. When the crisis hit, it forced them to speed up existing discussions and timelines. “We were going to start out with smaller meetings,” says Hunter Clemens, director of meetings at the APS. Instead, the society scrambled to move its annual April meeting online in a matter of weeks. Despite the accelerated timeline, Clemens says, the virtual meeting was “something amazing”.

That gathering, which took place on 18–21 April, drew more than 7,000 registrants — about four times more than its in-person attendance in a normal year, says Clemens. And almost all of them — around 96% — logged on to the conference at some point. The virtual sessions, on average, had higher attendance than in-person ones at standard APS April conferences.

Attendees say that virtual meetings are better in certain respects. Submitting questions online through moderated chats, for example, can help graduate students to feel less intimidated and allow scientists to formulate better queries. At the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in April, the ability of the audience to vote on questions in real time “resulted in a higher quality of question”, says Emily Costa, a cancer researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.

Universities will never be the same after the coronavirus crisis

Adam Tidball, a physicist at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, saw another benefit when he presented at the APS virtual April meeting. “I found that the networking was a lot better than in-person,” says Tidball. The conference provided attendees with a sort of matchmaking app for networking, with which users could read other scientists’ biographies and reach out to them to initiate a conversation or schedule a time to meet virtually.

The economics of online meetings are different from those of conventional ones. Clemens estimates that the virtual April meeting cost only about 45% of the equivalent in-person conference, although the society lost money on this year’s meeting because it had to make the shift so quickly and didn’t charge for attendance. The American Astronomical Society has had more time to plan its online-only meeting in June, and the cost to attend is around 60% cheaper than it was for its January meeting.

But the shift to online meetings could shrink one of the major revenue streams for societies, some of which draw a large fraction of their operating budget from their annual meeting. And if societies move to hold a dual online and in-person meeting, that could drive up costs because the meeting would require more staff, and both a venue and an online platform.

Researchers who have attended virtual meetings say that the meetings have several important downsides. Poster presentations can fall flat in an online space, and it’s difficult to have serendipitous encounters between sessions, which is where a lot of collaboration normally happens. Social scientist Marzena Świgoń says that unofficial chats during conferences are the most important way that scientists share knowledge with each other. “I think that virtual conferences are only temporary,” says Świgoń, who is at the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Poland. “As soon as the threat passes, conferences will return in their traditional form.”

Coronavirus and COVID-19: Keep up to date

Anthony Watkinson, an information scientist at CIBER Research in Newbury, UK, who has co-authored papers with Świgoń, is similarly sceptical of the permanence of virtual conferences. He says that UK and US researchers overwhelmingly report that in-person interactions are necessary for forging relationships.

Among many scientists, however, there is a clear mandate for at least providing the option to participate virtually. In an informal survey conducted by Nature, roughly 80% of 486 respondents said they thought that some meetings should continue to be held virtually, at least in some capacity, after the pandemic has subsided.

Now that the idea of a virtual meeting is less abstract, Cobb says, people might be more willing to open up conferences, meetings and seminars to remote participation. “I do honestly believe there will be some remnants of this that resonate on for many years.”||0
2020-06-02||As the pandemic’s economic toll grows around the world, some experts fear it could harm science for decades by putting many thousands of researchers out of work and forcing nations to slash funding as they rebuild societies. Others say the pandemic could highlight the importance of science and spur long-term support, especially for basic research, much as the Second World War did.

In the United States, where the rate of unemployment has risen towards levels last seen during the 1930s, many science leaders are trying to make the case that supporting research and development is crucial. “Without science to help, the country is in jeopardy,” says Harold Varmus, the Nobel-prizewinning cancer scientist who led the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) between 1993 and 1999.

In the wake of the pandemic, the biological sciences might thrive, in the way that the 1957 launch of Sputnik — the beach-ball-sized Soviet satellite that set off the space race — yielded decades of research and discovery in the physical sciences. “Researchers go where the money is,” says Julia Phillips, a member of the US National Science Board and former chief technology officer at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

The long-term economic consequences for science will vary significantly by country. Australia, for example, has warned that 7,000 university research jobs are at risk this year, whereas science remains largely intact in Germany, which is committed to investing an additional €17 billion (US$18 billion) in science agencies through to 2030, at a steady 3% increase in budgets annually. And although China’s economy and scientific momentum were slammed by the coronavirus, the country is poised to recover relatively quickly. It’s possible there could be a shuffling of priorities, leading the country to invest more in biology and epidemiology, says Cong Cao, a sociologist at the University of Nottingham campus in Ningbo, China.

Some of the most drastic changes could come in the United States, one of the world’s largest funders of scientific research and a country where spending decisions are made annually, unlike some other nations.

Several science-policy specialists have been looking to the last economic shock, the recession of 2007–09, for clues to the future. After that downturn, the US government doled out extra money to federal science agencies to jump-start programmes as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), a national plan to boost activity across all sectors (see ‘Funding waves’). The NIH, for example, received an extra US$10.8 billion in 2009 on top of the $30-billion annual budget. The ARRA fund was “an enormous amount of money” at the time, says Jennifer Zeitzer, director of legislative relations at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB), in Bethesda, Maryland.

The need this year is expected to eclipse that episode. In early April, a coalition of groups representing US universities asked Congress to provide $26 billion to science-funding agencies to support the scientific workforce and the reopening of academic labs. The funding could, for example, buffer delayed grants, re-establish colonies of mice that had to be killed and replenish stores of personal protective equipment that were donated to the pandemic effort.

So far, of the roughly $3 trillion in emergency money approved by Congress, nearly $4 billion has been directed at federal science agencies for coronavirus-related work, including developing vaccines and treatments. Groups such as FASEB expect hiring freezes and lab shrinkages to hit early-career faculty members and graduate students particularly hard. “What happens next? Obviously, we’re very worried,” Zeitzer says.

Universities will never be the same after the coronavirus crisis

Even in past economic crises, US science has received steady support from the government and industry, with total funding rising more than tenfold since the 1950s, when adjusted for inflation. The business sector accounts for some 70% of spending on basic, applied and translational research. But the US government remains the country’s biggest funder of basic science, making an investment of around $121 billion in 2017.

Although Congress has steadily increased federal dollars spent on science year-on-year, a big economic shock could trip up that trend. “Then you can see a scenario where in fact, the budgets for research agencies will go down,” says Elias Zerhouni, a physician who led the NIH between 2002 and 2008.

Such a blow could tip the balance between basic and applied research. In the past, budget crunches have favoured experimental and applied science over blue-sky research, says Phillips. And if that were to happen now, the United States could lose its competitive edge decades down the road. “The horizon moves in,” she says.

Coronavirus and COVID-19: Keep up to date

But, at a time when the coronavirus response has the attention of the public and lawmakers, this could also be an opportunity for universities and scientists to ask for more, says Varmus. “I think that the country is in a position now to appreciate what science has the potential to offer when the country is challenged. Moreover, they have the ability to recognize the economic consequences of not being better prepared.”

In fact, several US lawmakers have introduced legislation to dramatically boost funding for the National Science Foundation. They propose giving the agency $100 billion over 5 years, compared to its current annual budget of around $8 billion. The chances of the plan becoming law remain unclear, but Zeitzer expects it would be a smaller amount if it did.

Science in the United Kingdom might fare better than in the United States. In March, the government announced a bold plan to increase research funding from £9 billion (US$11 billion) a year to £22 billion by 2024–25. So far, there are no signs that commitment will change, says James Wilsdon, who studies science and technology policy at the University of Sheffield, UK. “Clearly, if the overall financial outlook is seriously damaged in terms of a prolonged recession or depression, then all bets are off.”||0
2020-06-02||Not even Trump’s supporters can contest this analogy, because the imposition of an alien ideology is precisely what he was calling for all along. Trump’s first statement as president, his inaugural address, was an unprecedented assault on American democracy and American values. Remember: He described America’s capital city, America’s government, America’s congressmen and senators—all democratically elected and chosen by Americans, according to America’s 227-year-old Constitution—as an “establishment” that had profited at the expense of “the people.” “Their victories have not been your victories,” he said. “Their triumphs have not been your triumphs.” Trump was stating, as clearly as he possibly could, that a new set of values was now replacing the old, though of course the nature of those new values was not yet clear. Almost as soon as he stopped speaking, Trump launched his first assault on fact-based reality, a long-undervalued component of the American political system. We are not a theocracy or a monarchy that accepts the word of the leader or the priesthood as law. We are a democracy that debates facts, seeks to understand problems, and then legislates solutions, all in accordance with a set of rules. Trump’s insistence—against the evidence of photographs, television footage, and the lived experience of thousands of people—that the attendance at his inauguration was higher than at Barack Obama’s first inauguration represented a sharp break with that American political tradition. Like the authoritarian leaders of other times and places, Trump effectively ordered not just his supporters but also apolitical members of the government bureaucracy to adhere to a blatantly false, manipulated reality. American politicians, like politicians everywhere, have always covered up mistakes, held back information, and made promises they could not keep. But until Trump was president, none of them induced the National Park Service to produce doctored photographs or compelled the White House press secretary to lie about the size of a crowd—or encouraged him to do so in front of a press corps that knew he knew he was lying. It takes time to persuade people to abandon their existing value systems. The process usually begins slowly, with small changes. The lie was petty, even ridiculous; that was partly why it was so dangerous. In the 1950s, when an insect known as the Colorado potato beetle appeared in Eastern European potato fields, Soviet-backed governments in the region triumphantly claimed that it had been dropped from the sky by American pilots, as a deliberate form of biological sabotage. Posters featuring vicious red-white-and-blue beetles went up all across Poland, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia. No one really believed the charge, including the people making it, as archives have subsequently shown. But that didn’t matter. The point of the posters was not to convince people of a falsehood. The point was to demonstrate the party’s power to proclaim and promulgate a falsehood. Sometimes the point isn’t to make people believe a lie—it’s to make people fear the liar.

Read: The saddest part of the anonymous ‘New York Times’ op-ed Instead, Anonymous concluded that remaining inside the system, where they could cleverly distract and restrain the president, was the right course for public servants like them. Anonymous was not alone. Gary Cohn, at the time the White House economic adviser, told Bob Woodward that he’d removed papers from the president’s desk to prevent him from pulling out of a trade agreement with South Korea. James Mattis, Trump’s original secretary of defense, stayed in office because he thought he could educate the president about the value of America’s alliances, or at least protect some of them from destruction. This kind of behavior has echoes in other countries and other times. A few months ago, in Venezuela, I spoke with Víctor Álvarez, a minister in one of Hugo Chávez’s governments and a high-ranking official before that. Álvarez explained to me the arguments he had made in favor of protecting some private industry, and his opposition to mass nationalization. Álvarez was in government from the late 1990s through 2006, a time when Chávez was stepping up the use of police against peaceful demonstrators and undermining democratic institutions. Still, Álvarez remained, hoping to curb Chávez’s worst economic instincts. Ultimately, he did quit, after concluding that Chávez had created a loyalty cult around himself—Álvarez called it a “subclimate” of obedience—and was no longer listening to anyone who disagreed. Anne Applebaum: Venezuela is the eerie endgame of modern politics In authoritarian regimes, many insiders eventually conclude that their presence simply does not matter. Cohn, after publicly agonizing when the president said there had been “fine people on both sides” at the deadly white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, finally quit when the president made the ruinous decision to put tariffs on steel and aluminum, a decision that harmed American businesses. Mattis reached his breaking point when the president abandoned the Kurds, America’s longtime allies in the war against the Islamic State. But although both resigned, neither Cohn nor Mattis has spoken out in any notable way. Their presence inside the White House helped build Trump’s credibility among traditional Republican voters; their silence now continues to serve the president’s purposes. As for Anonymous, we don’t know whether he or she remains inside the administration. For the record, I note that Álvarez lives in Venezuela, an actual police state, and yet is willing to speak out against the system he helped create. Cohn, Mattis, and Anonymous, all living freely in the United States of America, have not been nearly so brave. I, personally, will benefit. These, of course, are words that few people ever say out loud. Perhaps some do quietly acknowledge to themselves that they have not resigned or protested because it would cost them money or status. But no one wants a reputation as a careerist or a turncoat. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, even Markus Wolf sought to portray himself as an idealist. He had truly believed in Marxist-Leninist ideals, this infamously cynical man told an interviewer in 1996, and “I still believe in them.” Many people in and around the Trump administration are seeking personal benefits. Many of them are doing so with a degree of openness that is startling and unusual in contemporary American politics, at least at this level. As an ideology, “Trump First” suits these people, because it gives them license to put themselves first. To pick a random example: Sonny Perdue, the secretary of agriculture, is a former Georgia governor and a businessman who, like Trump, famously refused to put his agricultural companies into a blind trust when he entered the governor’s office. Perdue has never even pretended to separate his political and personal interests. Since joining the Cabinet he has, with almost no oversight, distributed billions of dollars of “compensation” to farms damaged by Trump’s trade policies. He has stuffed his department with former lobbyists who are now in charge of regulating their own industries: Deputy Secretary Stephen Censky was for 21 years the CEO of the American Soybean Association; Brooke Appleton was a lobbyist for the National Corn Growers Association before becoming Censky’s chief of staff, and has since returned to that group; Kailee Tkacz, a member of a nutritional advisory panel, is a former lobbyist for the Snack Food Association. The list goes on and on, as would lists of similarly compromised people in the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and elsewhere. Perdue’s department also employs an extraordinary range of people with no experience in agriculture whatsoever. These modern apparatchiks, hired for their loyalty rather than their competence, include a long-haul truck driver, a country-club cabana attendant, the owner of a scented-candle company, and an intern at the Republican National Committee. The long-haul truck driver was paid $80,000 a year to expand markets for American agriculture abroad. Why was he qualified? He had a background in “hauling and shipping agricultural commodities.” A friend told me that each time he sees Lindsey Graham, “he brags about having just met with Trump” while exhibiting “high school” levels of excitement, as if “a popular quarterback has just bestowed some attention on a nerdy debate-club leader.” I must remain close to power. Another sort of benefit, harder to measure, has kept many people who object to Trump’s policies or behavior from speaking out: the intoxicating experience of power, and the belief that proximity to a powerful person bestows higher status. This, too, is nothing new. In a 1968 article for The Atlantic, James Thomson, an American East Asia specialist, brilliantly explained how power functioned inside the U.S. bureaucracy in the Vietnam era. When the war in Vietnam was going badly, many people did not resign or speak out in public, because preserving their “effectiveness”—“a mysterious combination of training, style, and connections,” as Thomson defined it—was an all-consuming concern. He called this “the effectiveness trap”: The inclination to remain silent or to acquiesce in the presence of the great men—to live to fight another day, to give on this issue so that you can be “effective” on later issues—is overwhelming. Nor is it the tendency of youth alone; some of our most senior officials, men of wealth and fame, whose place in history is secure, have remained silent lest their connection with power be terminated. In any organization, private or public, the boss will of course sometimes make decisions that his underlings dislike. But when basic principles are constantly violated, and people constantly defer resignation—“I can always fall on my sword next time”—then misguided policies go fatal||0
2020-06-02||Queries about employment rights to free legal advice centres have almost doubled since the start of the pandemic.

Figures from the Free Legal Advice Centres (Flacs) and Community Law and Mediation (CLM) indicate a surge in the number of people concerned their employers have treated them illegally during the lockdown.

The CLM, which runs two community law centres, in Dublin and Limerick, has seen a 196 per cent increase in consultations since March on employment law – including breaches of contract, unequal treatment and difficulty accessing payments – compared with the same period last year.

Rose Wall, CLM chief executive, said the organisation had increased its usual four clinics a week to 11, by phone, in response to calls from workers.

Flac, which provides clinics across the State, said employment law queries accounted for 10 per cent of its calls in April 2019 but this doubled to 20 per cent last month.

In March it had 126 calls to its phone-in clinics about workers’ rights, rising to 180 in April.

Among its cases were: a woman who was asked to go on maternity leave early; people with underlying health conditions being told they must return to work despite their concerns for their own health; people being told to take paid annual leave, when they needed it for future commitments; and people being asked to resign as they could not work from home due to childcare problems.

Other cases involved people having their pay reduced while working from home or being told they must use their own phones and laptops while working from home, without recompense.

Other significant calls included women returning from work after maternity leave, or who were about to take such leave.

Other queries were from workers feeling their employers had not taken sufficient health and safety measures, including a man who was told he had to travel for several hours with colleagues in a van, with no personal protective equipment provided.

Ms Wall said while the impact of coronavirus on businesses was “unprecedented”, it could not be used as a time to be lax about employees’ rights.

“People are feeling overwhelmed and vulnerable to the added complexities that Covid-19 brings to the workforce. With the number of people unemployed or supported under the temporary wage subsidy scheme now at about 1.1million, it is becoming increasingly difficult to challenge discrimination or mistreatment in the workplace.”

Eilis Barry, chief executive of Flac, said callers were “extremely stressed”. Both organisations said the number of employment-related calls was likely to increase as more people returned, or hoped to return, to work.

This underlined “the acute need for the availability and accessibility of legal advice, advocacy and legal aid during a crisis,” said Ms Barry, reiterating her call for a reform of the civil legal aid system.

“We must protect our workers and ensure that legal aid is accessible to all,” she said.

Employment rights are not currently covered by the civil legal aid scheme.

CLM has written to political parties involved in government-formation talks calling for prioritisation of reform of the civil legal aid scheme, including that workers have access to legal aid and representation in the Workplace Relations Commission.||1
2020-06-02||After two years of planning, Germany assumes the Europen Council’s rotating presidency in a month. Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, the only detail of its presidency plan to survive is the logo: an endless loop known as a “Möbius strip”. You can create one by taking a tape-like strip of material, giving one end a short twist and fusing both ends. What makes a Möbius strip interesting is how two lines, sent off in different sides and on opposite sides, eventually meet. For Germany this phenomenon reflects how, in the EU, 27 sovereign states’ divergent positions eventually converge.

Chancellor Angela Merkel will need something far stronger than Möbius strips to get her through to Christmas. Last week, with characteristically laconic understatement, she suggested the pandemic would require “considerable adjustment” to Germany’s EU presidency plans. German civil servants know that, culturally speaking, busking is not their speciality. But they are being led by a woman who, in her 15 years in power, has become the uncrowned queen of drive-by-sight politics.

The EU’s rolling schedule meant this was already going to be a crucial presidency, with deadlines looming on a final Brexit deal and agreement on the EU’s upcoming seven-year budget.

Covid-19 has now upended everything. But like epidemiologists grappling with the novel coronavirus, Dr Merkel, a physicist, treats politics as a long-term laboratory experiment: when new information comes in, the procedures are adapted, the experiment is adjusted and run again.

With an eye on her political legacy, Dr Merkel hopes to use the common Covid-19 thread of crisis to draw together EU challenges new and old – economics, health, migration, climate and rule of law – to make a major integration push.

As Merkel’s fourth and final term enters its last year, Europe’s longest-serving leader faces an Olympian test of her eye for detail, her nose for negotiation and her ear for compromise. In this time of crisis, as the limits and potential of politics are being recalibrated, the EU can draw one last time on Europe’s safest pair of hands.||0
2020-06-02||The Nevada State Athletic Commission approved the UFC for two events in Las Vegas during a meeting that was held via phone on Wednesday, May 27. The approval of those events, the first of which took place on Saturday, came with an NSAC mandated COVID-19 protocol document. The requirements of that document were more stringent than those the UFC used — and had difficulty following — in Jacksonville for three events earlier in May. The NSAC seems happy with what it saw from the promotion on Saturday at the UFC Apex.

“The 5/30 UFC event was held in accordance with NSAC protocols and the UFC’s Operational Plan which was approved by the NSAC. The event was extremely successful. The UFC went to great lengths and expenses to ensure all personnel were in compliance with COVID-19 precautionary measures and were in compliance with all regulatory and governmental requirements for a closed system event,” the NSAC told Bloody Elbow.

Some major upgrades in the NSAC COVID-19 protocol document:
• Utilization of a “closed system” for the events
• Documented protocol for entering and exiting the closed system
• Documented protocol for reacting to a positive COVID-19 test, which includes two weeks quarantine in Nevada
• Discipline for those who do not adhere to NSAC COVID-19 protocol
• Post-fight interviews did not take place face to face

The UFC didn’t do the best job enforcing the protocols it wrote for the Jacksonville events. The success in Las Vegas should make fighters and others involved with upcoming Las Vegas events feel more confident about the upcoming UFC 250 and other fights that will take place at UFC Apex.

Bloody Elbow asked the UFC which protocol it will follow for any events scheduled for “Fight Island.” The UFC did not respond before publication.||0
2020-06-02||Worries about the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant mothers and their offspring are wide-spread. As a comparison, the Spanish Flu pandemic had devastating health impacts on pregnant mothers and in-utero exposure to influenza is known to have negative short- and long-term consequences for children. This column, however, argues that the existing evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic allows for cautious optimism about the impacts of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their children.

More than 2.5 million women are currently pregnant in the United States, and many are worried about the impact a COVID-19 infection might have on mothers and the development of their unborn children. A large literature surrounding the foetal origins hypothesis has shown that pregnancy conditions not only impact the mother but can also impair the offspring (Almond and Currie 2011). Maternal influenza infections during pregnancy may induce premature birth (Currie and Schwandt 2013) and strong cases may even impair foetal development to the point where repercussions throughout adulthood are observed (Schwandt 2019). In his seminal paper, Almond (2006) documented lower incomes and higher adult disability rates among the entire cohort of infants that was in-utero during the Spanish Flu pandemic.

What about children born during the COVID-19 pandemic?

While at this moment it is still unclear whether maternal COVID-19 infections impair foetal development, the existing evidence allows for cautious optimism. The rate of reported COVID-19 deaths among pregnant mothers is low (Hantoushzadeh et al. 2020) and while infections occur in pregnant mothers, most are mild or remain asymptomatic (Sutton et al. 2020, Luo and Yin 2020). Children of mothers infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy are born without detectable impairments and typically test negative for the virus (Chen et al. 2020; Yu et al. 2020).

However, it is too early to know whether in-utero exposure to COVID-19 has negative long-term consequences that are not immediately visible at birth. A potential reference point is the Spanish Flu pandemic (Aassve et al. 2020, Benmelech and Frydman 2020). However, it is important to keep in mind that the 1918 influenza virus had a very different, more devastating impact – particularly for pregnant mothers. Figure 1 compares the age profile of COVID-19 mortality in New York City with Spanish Flu mortality in Philadelphia, one of the hardest hit cities during the Spanish Flu pandemic (Markel et al. 2007). Both mortality rates are shown per 100,000 people, but are plotted on different y-axes since COVID-19 deaths rates are likely to continue increasing in the ongoing pandemic.

Figure 1 COVID-19 mortality (in NYC) and Spanish Flu mortality (in Philadelphia) by age and gender

Notes: Data on COVID-19 death counts for New York City, 1 February 2020-20 May 2020 (CDC 2020), combined with population estimates for 2017 (NYSDH 2017). Data on Spanish Flu mortality from Rogers (1920).

COVID-19 mortality increases exponentially with age, with extremely low death rates among infants, children, and young adults (these numbers include recent cases of multi-system inflammatory syndrome, Schroeder 2020). Mortality is particularly low for young women. Among a total of 16,493 COVID-19 deaths in New York City (between 1 February 2020 and 20 May 2020), not a single female fatality occurred below age 25. For women between the ages of 25 and 34, only five out of every 100,000 have died —and this figure is far lower than the rate for women 65 or older, where the data show more than 740 deaths per 100,000.

For the Spanish Flu, the age profile of deaths looked dramatically different. Fatalities were highly concentrated among infants and young adults. Among women, the majority of deaths occurred in the fertile age range and mortality was especially high among pregnant women (Almond 2006). For every death, there were many cases of severe illness, with recorded stillbirths more than doubling during the pandemic (Rogers 1920).

In other words, pregnant mothers who survived the Spanish Flu experienced extreme levels of sickness in response to influenza infections during the pandemic. This strong impact could not be more different from the current experience with COVID-19 infections, which often go largely unnoticed in pregnant mothers. This brings us to the last question in assessing the relative risks between the two pandemics for a developing fetus:

Are mothers’ mild responses to COVID-19 infections good or bad for an infant in utero?

Strong maternal reactions observed for influenza infections may drain the mother’s body, but they could be an efficient response, e.g. to protect the fetus from contracting the virus itself.

However, it turns out that the fetus does not usually get infected if the pregnant mother contracts an influenza virus or the COVID-19 virus (i.e. the virus does not pass the placenta). Hence, it is the strong maternal response to the influenza virus that impairs foetal development. A strong immune system response of the mother can lead to broad inflammations in the pregnant body (McDade 2012) which fight not only the virus but also damage healthy tissue such as the placenta. Pregnant womens’ mild immune system response to COVID-19 is, therefore, a hopeful sign.

Strong inflammations are also hypothesized to turn the mother’s immune system itself against the fetus. The father’s genes in the fetus are foreign to the mother’s body and are only tolerated due to the mediation of helper cells surrounding the placenta (Trowsdale and Betz 2006). A strong inflammatory response can compromise the functionality of these helper cells. As a result, the fetus might not only suffer from the inflammation itself, but an inflammation can actually cause the mother’s immune system to harm the fetus. It remains unclear why pregnancy makes women respond so strongly to the influenza virus (Kay et al. 2014), but it has been observed both for pandemics and seasonal influenza. Further, the resulting infections have similar negative impacts on the offspring – both at birth as well as into adulthood (Almond 2006, Creanga et al. 2009, Currie and Schwandt 2013, Schwandt 2019).

It is important to emphasize that our understanding of the threats of COVID-19 is still far from complete. We are learning from new research findings on a daily basis. But there is room for cautious optimism from what we know so far: COVID-19 seems to impact pregnant women less than influenza does. While immune system responses triggered by maternal influenza have been shown to impair foetal development, COVID-19 does not seem to cause such strong responses in mothers’ immune systems. Of course, it is still possible that other impairments in the offspring may appear later, even if they are not observable at birth. And only time will tell whether infants exposed to COVID-19 during the first or second trimester will show signs of impairment at birth. But, so far, the existing evidence allows for cautious hope that pregnant mothers and their offspring will fare much better during COVID-19 than they did during the last devastating global pandemic at the turn of the 20th century.

This is not to say that pregnant mothers and young children are entirely unaffected by the current pandemic. Food insecurity is on the rise (Schanzenbach and Pitts 2020), and many young families face financial stress as unemployment is soaring to unprecedented levels (Conti 2020). Nutritional, economic, and psychological stress during pregnancy is detrimental for the fetus as it increases the risk of poor health at birth which may in turn lead to negative long-term consequences (Aizer et al. 2016 Almond et al. 2011, Persson and Rossin-Slater 2018). Hence, we do not want to add unfounded anxieties about COVID-19 infections to mothers’ list of worries—as fewer worries might help their developing infants most.

2020-06-02||H tend to be recession-proof. People always need haircuts. During the financial crisis of 2007-09 the number of hairdressers in America even rose. For Sylvia, who owns a small salon in Amsterdam, that crisis was very different from today’s. “Lockdown came out of nowhere and I had no buffer.” She is heartened that regulars phoned in when she reopened. “If it had lasted any longer”, she says, fighting back tears while disinfecting the previous customer’s seat, “I would have gone under.”

Women have borne the brunt of the economic disruption caused by the pandemic. In America, despite making up less than half of the workforce, they accounted for 55% of jobs lost in April. In Britain mothers are one-and-a-half times as likely as fathers to have lost or quit their jobs during lockdown, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies ( ), a think-tank.

The unevenness reflects the fact that women are more likely to work in services that require interacting with people. But hotels and shops have shut, and the work cannot be done from home. And crèches and schools have closed, leading some women to stop work and others to work less, in order to look after their children. If job and productivity losses persist, they could reverse progress towards gender equality in the workplace.

Today’s picture is in stark contrast to past recessions (see chart). Men are usually worse affected, because they dominate sectors such as manufacturing and construction, which tend to be badly hit. Matthias Doepke of Northwestern University and Michele Tertilt of the University of Mannheim estimate that three-quarters of all cyclical employment fluctuations in 1989-2014 were owing to men losing and gaining jobs. Women, by contrast, have acted as stabilisers. Employment in services, which is female-dominated, tends to be less volatile. And wives take up work or increase their hours when husbands lose jobs.

This time, though, industries involving face-to-face interaction, such as hospitality, have suffered most. In America health care and education have not been spared, with five times as many women losing their jobs as men. Firms run by women are also concentrated in customer-facing areas, which is why female small-business founders are much more likely than men to expect a drop in sales owing to covid-19, according to a survey by Nicholas Bloom and Robert Fletcher of Stanford University. Whether the hit to so-called “pink” sectors persists depends on whether customers flock back as restrictions are lifted. Structural shifts could well mean fewer air hostesses or event organisers, for instance. Temporary lay-offs could become permanent as firms go bust. (The pink crisis could also turn purple: in Canada, job losses in “blue” sectors seem to be catching up.) Sex segregation alone cannot explain why women have been hit hardest, though. Even after controlling for it, women in Britain were 15% more likely to have lost their job and 8% more likely to have been furloughed, according to research led by Abi Adams-Prassl of Oxford University. Possible explanations include discrimination, or that, bereft of child care, some mothers chose to leave their jobs. Higher-skilled women are less likely to lose their jobs than lower-skilled ones. Many are juggling working from home with child care. British households with young children are doing an extra 40 hours of care and schooling a week, find Almudena Sevilla of University College London and Sarah Smith of the University of Bristol. Mums do two-thirds of this, on average.

The gradual emergence from lockdowns could do particular harm to women’s careers, worries Claudia Goldin of Harvard University. With workplaces reopening before crèches fully do, couples could be forced to decide who returns to work and who minds the kids. The lower earner, often the woman, might stay home.

Meanwhile, mothers working at home are 50% more likely to be interrupted than fathers, according to the . This “Mu-u-um” pattern, evident even when the woman is the higher earner, could harm pay and promotions. “I fear we’ll see the impact in two to three years’ time in a widening gender pay gap,” says Vera Troeger of Warwick University. Academia offers a glimpse of what may come. Several journals report fewer submissions by women during the pandemic; male submissions to some journals have picked up.

The pandemic has, at least, made remote working normal. Before it, only one in 50 Americans worked from home full-time. By April, more than one in three did. With the concept tested, says Mr Bloom, “we’re never going back to the old world.” That would be good news for mothers, who tend to pick jobs that fit around their children, with more forgiving hours and shorter commutes. But it will mainly benefit university graduates, whose jobs are easier to do from home. Less-educated women cannot count on such a silver lining. A loss of employer demand and extra child-care duties make their job prospects bleaker. ■||1

• Total Access Urgent Care is providing tests at two of its locations that can yield results within 30 minutes. The two centers — at 1090 North Highway 67 in Florissant and 12616 Lamplighter Square in South County — are using the Abbott molecular test, which analyzes nasal swabs and has been approved for emergency use by the FDA.

The FDA warned two weeks ago, however, of possible inaccurate negative test results and is working with Abbott to address the problem.“This test can still be used and can correctly identify many positive cases in minutes. Negative results may need to be confirmed,” Dr. Tim Stenzel with the FDA stated in a press release.Missouri’s public lab Jefferson City takes 24 hours to process results once specimens are received, while private labs take anywhere from one to six days, said Lisa Cox with the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Hospitals also have their own tests with quick turnaround.Total Access’ health insurance partners have agreed to cover costs of visits related to COVID-19, according to a company press release. Uninsured patients will have to pay $99 upfront. The cost will be submitted to a federal relief fund, and patients will be reimbursed later. The cost is not covered however, for Medicaid patients.||1
2020-06-03||As lockdown measures continue, or are relaxed only gradually, many small businesses continue to experience significantly reduced turnover. This column reports on a firm-level analysis across 16 emerging markets, and three Western European comparator countries, in order to gauge the potential risks associated with debt-driven COVID-19 support. The overall goal is to prevent a wave of bankruptcies that could break valuable relationships between firms and their suppliers and employees. However, liquidity support in the form of additional bank lending may create debt-overhang problems in the future and therefore requires careful targeting.

Over the past decade, corporate leverage has increased considerably in many developing countries and emerging markets, often exacerbating financial fragility (Alfaro et al. 2019). Policymakers who aim to alleviate corporate cash shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic therefore need to avoid overloading financially vulnerable firms with more debt. This risk is real given that the most popular method of COVID-19 support to SMEs has been to provide these firms with more loans. To gauge the potential risks associated with debt-driven COVID-19 support, this column reports on a firm-level analysis across 16 emerging markets, and three Western European comparator countries. Our objective is to understand where ‘small and medium-sized enterprises’ (SMEs) are most in need of cash and liquidity and, second, where these firms still have room on their balance sheet to take on more debt. Where there is little or no such room, further bank lending may come at the risk of a structural weakening of banks’ balance sheets (Galí 2020).

Our analysis is based on a firm-level dataset that combines information from surveys conducted as part of the latest round of the EBRD-EIB-World Bank Enterprise Surveys (with data from Orbis). We use these data to estimate regression models of firms’ optimal capital structure or leverage (defined as formal debt to total assets) and, separately, their cash holdings (defined as cash and cash equivalents to total assets). The models clarify how firms’ pre-COVID-19 capital structures and cash buffers can be explained by basic firm characteristics such as their size, profitability, asset tangibility, turnover variability, and industry.

Using these simple models, we then calculate for each country how much the average small business’s cash buffer falls short of (or exceeds) the predicted cash buffer. Likewise, we measure the available capacity for additional debt of the average SME (firms with 250 or fewer employees) in each country. Figure 1 summarises these calculations. The horizontal axis shows how SME cash holdings in countries such as Croatia, Lithuania, Morocco, Serbia, Slovenia, and Ukraine fall short of the predicted value by between 3-7% of total assets. In contrast, the average small business in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Latvia, Montenegro, and Slovak Republic has greater than predicted cash buffers.

Figure 1 Excess leverage and cash holdings of the average small business



 Source: Authors’ calculations based on data from ES and Orbis.

The vertical axis of figure 1 shows where small firms (on average) still have the capacity to borrow more. For instance, this is the case in countries like Lithuania, Morocco, and Ukraine (countries where SMEs seem to have an urgent need for more liquidity), as well as in Bulgaria, Montenegro, and Slovak Republic (countries with excess cash). In contrast, in countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Slovenia (as well as Portugal,) there appears to be (on average) little room for more debt. It should be noted that even the average SME in many of these countries appears to have had limited liquidity buffers at the time pandemic first broke out.

Next, using the same models, we calculate for each country the proportion of SMEs that operate with lower than predicted cash buffers as well as the proportion of SMEs that entered the COVID-19 pandemic with relatively ample cash reserves. Likewise, for each country we calculate the proportion of SMEs that had little room for additional debt, and the proportion of SMEs that still appear in a position to absorb more debt. Figure 2 summarises these results. More than 60% of SMEs in Morocco and Ukraine are both short on cash and have room to take on extra debt. In contrast, we again see high shares of small businesses in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, and Slovenia that are short on cash but are already highly leveraged. Estonia and Poland are similar in that about a third of all SMEs are short on cash but already have borrowed a lot.

Figure 2 Distribution of small businesses by pre-Covid-19 debt and cash structure



 Source: Authors’ calculations based on data from ES and Orbis.

How long can small businesses survive with their existing cash buffers? As a rough indicator, we calculate the number of months that a small business can afford to pay its employees out of its existing cash reserves. We then plot the distribution of businesses by different ‘survival horizons’ in Chart 3. About half of all small businesses in Ukraine have cash reserves of less than one month’s wages. Only around 20% of Ukrainian SMEs have the liquidity to pay more than six months’ wages. Similarly, most small businesses in Montenegro, Russia, Lithuania, and Slovenia were likely to run out of cash reserves to pay their workers in less than two months.

Where can credit access relieve liquidity constraints the most? Figure 3 also shows how the share of small businesses with liquidity constraints would change were they to ‘load up’ on debt to a level that our model would predict is normal (given their other firm characteristics). This shows, for instance, that additional lending to Ukrainian SMEs could decrease the share of businesses with cash buffers that only cover up to one month of wages from 50% to 20%.

Our empirical analysis is rudimentary in the sense that it disregards certain firm- and country-specific determinants of corporate debt and cash buffers. Notwithstanding, the analysis provides a straightforward and micro-founded ‘traffic light system’. This can help diagnose in which countries firms’ needs for liquidity are most dire, and (as importantly) in which countries these temporary cash shortages can safely be alleviated through more debt funding. For instance, in countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Slovenia, there appear to be a relatively large number of firms in need of liquidity but there are also many firms that are already highly indebted. In such countries, efforts to support cash-strapped firms may take the following into consideration:
• Decisions about whether to alleviate cash shortages through additional bank lending should ideally continue to be based on a case-by-case assessment of individual firms’ debt capacity. This in turn requires a view on whether the business was performing well before the pandemic, or already had issues. Business exit remains an essential part of the process of creative destruction.
• Where possible, lending programs should require participating banks to make full use of existing credit bureaus and registries to ensure a complete picture of total outstanding debt. This holds in particular for emerging markets with a history of episodes of excessive private sector borrowing, and where information sharing among lenders has proven beneficial (De Haas et al. 2020).
• In countries where few firms have spare debt capacity, SMEs may be better served by government-sponsored initiatives to roll over existing debt rather than to provide fresh debt. This may include temporary debt moratoriums and loan-maturity extensions.
• On a structural level, many emerging markets will need to gradually rebalance their financial systems towards a greater use of equity instruments and a reduced reliance on debt (EBRD 2015). In the short term, interesting proposals have been made for a European Pandemic Equity Fund (Boot et al. 2020). Such a fund would provide cash-strapped SMEs with cash flow injections in return for, for instance, a surcharge on future corporate tax payments. In the medium term, governments and (multi-)national development banks can play a proactive role in stimulating a public and private equity culture in emerging markets (for instance through improving research coverage and hence transparency of listed SMEs). As part of the COVID-19 response, financial resilience can further be rebuilt by selective equity investments in financially sound, high-growth, and innovative small businesses with strong management already in place. Lastly, in the long run, policy makers could structurally reduce tax-code favouritism towards debt (for instance, by giving firms equivalent tax benefits for equity and debt).

2020-06-03||On 31 May 2020, WHO received information that between 18 and 30 May, four deaths were reported from the same quarter (quartier Air Congo) in Mbandaka Health Zone, Mbandaka city, Equateur Province, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. All cases had experienced fever and bleeding prior to their deaths. Of the four patients who died, two of them visited the General Reference Hospital (HGR) in Wangata; a sample (swab) was taken from one of them who died on 30 May. Safe and dignified burials were not performed for these four patients.

On 31 May, the brother of the probable case who died on 22 May and his wife presented to HGR Wangata; both had fever, non-bloody diarrhoea and vomiting. They were placed in isolation after blood samples were collected.

The three samples including two blood samples and a swab, were analyzed at a laboratory in Mbandaka where all three samples tested positive for Ebola virus disease (EVD) by GeneXpert Ebola assay. One of the three samples (swab) was sent on 31 May 2020, to the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) in Kinshasa and tested positive for Zaire Ebolavirus using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

As of 2 June 2020, eight epidemiologically-linked cases, including two confirmed alive cases, two suspected cases and four deaths (one confirmed and three probable deaths), have been reported. The Ministry of Health (MOH) officially declared the outbreak in Equateur Province on 1 June 2020.

Equateur Province experienced an EVD outbreak with 54 cases and 33 deaths, reported between 8 May 2018 through 24 July 2018. This is the eleventh outbreak of EVD reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the virus was discovered in 1976.

In the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak, the health capacity and resources in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are already strained and causing additional burdens on the national health system. The risk of disruption to surveillance and routine public health activities due to COVID-19 might jeopardize the country’s ability to rapidly contain re-emergence of these EVD cases. As of 2 June 2020, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has reported 3 194 COVID-19 cases and 71 deaths.

WHO, with the MOH, are implementing a coordinated rapid response to stop the spread of the outbreak, and to identify any other suspect cases and initiate contact tracing. In-depth epidemiological investigation and contact tracing were initiated on 31 May 2020.

The MOH, with support from WHO and partners have planned the following actions:

The laboratory capacity in Mbandaka is being assessed and support is on-going for appropriate set-up and additional supplies. Safe and dignified burial activities could resume shortly following proper community engagement. Support for case management is also important to ensure provision of care to affected individuals.

WHO did not receive adequate EVD funding since the start of 2020, and is currently using its emergency funds to support the epidemiological and public health interventions. Financial and human resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, WHO, and partners are challenged by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.

WHO notes that the current resurgence is undesirable, but not unexpected given the identification of wildlife spillover potential in Africa, accompanied by the high population density in the region and considering the sociological, ecological, and environmental drivers that could influence the emergence of EVD.

There is a need for: epidemiologists to conduct disease surveillance; infection prevention and control (IPC) specialists; vaccinators; case management and laboratory staff; and, risk communication and community engagement experts. Materials for infection prevention and control (IPC) and personal protective equipment (PPE), cold-chain, reagents for laboratory diagnostics, and means of transportation are required for the teams.

The area where the cases and deaths were reported, is populated with poor and vulnerable populations, known to be reluctant to social mobilization. This might pose further challenges in terms of case investigation, contact tracing, safe and dignified burials, and vaccination in the coming days.

Additional challenges have been identified regarding:
• further investigations into this event to understand the extent of the outbreak;
• contact identification and tracing, and identification of suspected cases;
• the COVID-19 context including lockdowns and non-availability of flights.

The investigations are ongoing to assess the full extent of the outbreak and therefore high vigilance should be maintained. This information will help define the risk in the coming days.

WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce Ebola virus disease transmission in humans:
• Reducing the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission from contact with infected fruit bats or monkeys/apes and the consumption of their raw meat. Animals should be handled with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing. Animal products (blood and meat) should be thoroughly cooked before consumption.
• Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission from direct or close contact with people with Ebola symptoms, particularly with their bodily fluids. Gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients at home. Regular hand washing is required after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after taking care of patients at home.
• Reducing the risk of possible sexual transmission, based on further analysis of ongoing research and consideration by the WHO Advisory Group on the Ebola Virus Disease Response, WHO recommends that male survivors of EVD practice safe sex and hygiene for 12 months from onset of symptoms or until their semen tests negative twice for Ebola virus. Contact with body fluids should be avoided and washing with soap and water is recommended. WHO does not recommend isolation of male or female convalescent patients whose blood has been tested negative for Ebola virus.
• Continue training and re-training of health work force for early detection, isolation and treatment of EVD cases.

WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information.

2020-06-03||As if our 2020 wasn’t challenging enough, we are now confronted by another crisis that we must address. We are all feeling a lot of pain, anger, frustration, sadness and yes, fear. Especially because, with respect to race relations in the U.S., the progress feels both significant and still not enough at the same time. Nobody needs to be told how to properly treat another human being, and that’s not going to happen here – clearly racism and the killing by police of George Floyd, among others, similarly over time, are unacceptable to us. We stand by all peaceful protesters of these senseless events, and we are anxious for justice to be served, properly and swiftly!

DigitalOcean’s values start with community and end with love. We are expanding our Hub for Good program to support nonprofits, projects, and startups that are actively fighting for a range of causes that include reducing inequalities, promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, and productive employment for all.

When we initially launched Hub for Good in April, the program was designed to support relief efforts during the height of COVID-19. We are proud to have received over 1,000 applications to date, helped launch almost 600 projects, and have donated over $150,000 in infrastructure. Hub for Good started as a space where our community came together to build and share projects and resources with missions centered around COVID-19 relief efforts.

Now, we are broadening, indefinitely, our Hub for Good program to assist with other challenges our community is facing and, based on the extension, will commit up to $500,000 in infrastructure credits. We stand for equality and justice and want to donate our infrastructure to help our community build solutions to help the world better address both.

We are proud to support those who are making a difference and inspiring even more action. We hope you’ll join us in our mission to uplift our community, bring us all closer together, and make the positive impact on our world that we need so urgently now.

We’re in the process of making these changes to the Hub for Good page. Stay tuned to learn more about these updates, and how to get involved and spread the word.

Stay strong and stay safe and, most importantly, stay focused on the good we all can do!||2
2020-06-03|- This is a really tough time for a lot of business owners. When you've put months or years into your business and now suddenly something threatens that business, it can feel demoralizing. But during times like this, you can't control external circumstances. All you can control is how you respond. So start by asking yourself what has changed, but also what hasn't changed? It's likely that your customers' core needs haven't changed, so if they're not coming to you, if they're not buying from you, identify what they're doing differently. That can help you plan a path forward for your business. My name is Jay Clouse. I'm the founder of Unreal Collective, a community of small business owners just like you. Over the last several weeks, I've had a front row seat to how dozens of business owners are reacting and adapting to the challenges of COVID-19. It's really hard for them. It's really hard for me, and I'm sure it's really hard for you too. But I want you to know that you're not powerless. You can react and adapt, and I want to help you do just that.|2
2020-06-03||COVID-19 has laid bare the weaknesses of clinical diagnostics infrastructures. Underfunded, undervalued and underprepared, laboratory testing has been overwhelmed by the contagion. A combination of low reimbursement, low margins, low capacity and low investment has stifled innovation and competition. Cost-cutting, centralization and regulatory rigidity have created backlogs and slowed the tracking of infections. Given the pivotal role of diagnostics in healthcare decision-making, COVID-19 shows just how much clinical testing needs a radical rethink.

On May 28, the United States achieved a record 416,664 tests for SARS-CoV-2 in one day (around one test per thousand people per day). The United Kingdom, France, Spain and much of the rest of Europe are testing at a similar level. Given that only ~3,000 tests are carried out per day during a typical flu season, we are approaching the limit of testing capacity using existing clinical laboratories and supply chains. But it is nowhere near the level needed for countries to contain COVID-19 while reopening their economies.

According to the World Health Organization, if more than 10% of results come back positive, testing capacity is insufficient; test positivity higher than 10% means many active infections are being missed. Nobel laureate economist Paul Romer has suggested 30 million daily tests are needed to reach the 10% positivity threshold in the United States. The Rockefeller Foundation Testing Action Plan projects 5 million tests by early June, growing to 20 million in the following four months. Even the lowest estimates suggest 750,000 to 900,000 molecular tests will be needed every day — more than double what is presently available.

The massive scale of testing now needed is a result of government failure at the beginning of the outbreak to quickly implement testing, tracking and tracing measures — together with social distancing — to limit the community spread of SARS-CoV-2. In those countries where lockdown was decisive and stringent tracking and tracing procedures were put in place — Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore — subsequent massive testing has been unnecessary.

Elsewhere, failed lockdowns and slipshod testing have gone hand in hand. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control botched its test rollout and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dithered on Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs), vacillating between oversight that was too stringent for RT-PCR testing and too lax for serological testing. The United Kingdom abandoned broad testing and contact tracing in March, then reversed its policy. France planned widespread testing at the end of March, then gave up on diagnostic testing when it became clear its clinical testing infrastructure couldn’t deliver.

The shrinking number of public labs, along with their centralization, has meant results can take days if not weeks to come back — useless for tracking and tracing. France has only 45 testing labs; the United States just 97 public labs, with a commercial sector dominated by corporate giants like Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp. Germany stands apart, with a robust infrastructure of 20 national reference centers, around 40 ‘consultant laboratories’ and hundreds of hospital- and clinic-based local testing centers. Results from the extended network are coordinated through a computer system adapted from Germany’s Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance network; Heidelberg even has a ‘corona taxi’ program that transports medics in protective gear to check on patients in their homes.

In contrast, testing in the United States is a mess. With shambolic coordination at the national level, existing providers have become swamped, testing backlogs have lengthened and shortages of swabs, supplies and reagents have grown. As traditional labs failed to ramp up, several research centers and hubs have stepped in and retooled to provide semi-automated ‘pop up’ labs for COVID-19, working with regulatory authorities and partnering with clinically accredited labs to innovate around reagent shortages. One open-source effort recently won an FDA EUA for processing >10,000 samples per day using automated loop-mediated isothermal amplification, circumventing RT-PCR reagent shortages and aiming to provide results in 24 hours. Another idea is to use multiplexing schemes and next-generation sequencing to pool thousands of bar-coded COVID-19 samples and then triage down to confirmatory testing for the identification of individual positives — an approach that enabled Wuhan, China to test 6.5 million people in 9 days.

Whatever technology is adopted, with tests in such short supply, strategic deployment to hotspots will be important in combination with contact tracing: clinical centers, essential services, travel hubs, nursing homes, meat-packing plants and places of congregation (bars, nightclubs or religious gatherings) will remain priorities, with drive-thru testing provided as an adjunct.

During reopening, testing volume will most likely be built by employers. Symptom reporting and contact-tracing apps built on Apple and Google’s API will be used to identify workers to prioritize for testing (Drexel University and Baylor College already offer such an app). Ultimately, kits for doctors’ offices and at-home testing will become available, some perhaps even using CRISPR technology, like those from Mammoth Biosciences or Sherlock Biosciences.

The failure of the clinical diagnostic sector to deal with the demands of a 21st century pandemic is a wake-up call. The traditional players appear incapable of innovating around the problem — probably because innovation is alien in an environment where reimbursement cuts by the 2014 Protecting Access to Medicare Act, erosion of intellectual property protection, and a lack of regulatory clarity has depressed profit margins and stunted investment.

But infectious disease is not going away. And in an increasingly interconnected, urbanized and globalized world, COVID-19 has shown that present lab testing systems are clearly unfit for purpose. A reinvigoration of new ideas and new technology is urgently needed to put diagnostics back at the forefront of twenty-first-century medicine and pandemic prevention.||1
2020-06-04||Jonathan Cotliar knew he was ahead of the curve four years ago when he joined Science 37, a company that supports virtual clinical trials conducted mostly online. The firm in Los Angeles, California, was growing slowly before March, receiving about a dozen calls a week from potential clients. But since the COVID-19 pandemic began, Science 37 has been running at fever pitch.

Cotliar, the company’s chief medical officer, says Science 37 now receives hundreds of enquiries every week from potential clients, such as pharmaceutical companies, medical centres and even individual investigators. With hospitals forming the epicentres of COVID-19 outbreaks around the world, clinical-trial participants have become reluctant to attend routine check-ups and monitoring, and health-care workers are stretched beyond their capacity. This has caused researchers to put many clinical trials on hold or to shift to a virtual trial structure by performing consultations online and collecting as much paperwork and data as possible remotely.

The pandemic might hasten the kind of change in clinical trials that Cotliar and Science 37 were hoping to make anyway. And there could be other lasting effects on drug development: companies that are usually competitors are now collaborating, and many are trying to make their supply chains more robust to deal with disruption. Some researchers and companies in the drug-development field say the system might never be the same again.

The pandemic has touched nearly all aspects of the industry, says Kenneth Kaitin, director of the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development in Boston, Massachusetts. “This has really turned upside down the whole drug-development process,” he says. “The entire investigative world is focused just on developing treatments for COVID-19.”

Scientists’ worlds will shrink in the wake of the pandemic

Some changes are likely to be temporary, Kaitin predicts. Drug regulators in the United States and other countries have acted fast to approve clinical trials of therapies and allow new uses of existing medicines to fight COVID-19, without demanding as much data and paperwork as they normally would. Such changes are likely to stick only for as long as the outbreak lasts. “The flexibilities that are being granted for clinical-trial development are being granted under the auspices of a public-health declaration,” says Esther Krofah, executive director of FasterCures, a Washington DC think tank. “That, to me, is very much an emergency operation.”

And Kaitin points out that these changes shave only a few months off the drug-development timeline — crucial in the middle of a pandemic, but unlikely to make a significant dent in the lengthy process of developing a therapy, which can stretch out over years.

The pandemic could catalyse lasting change in other ways. What might linger, Krofah says, is the culture of collaboration across government, industry and academia that has emerged during the outbreak. “We have traditional competitors working together in new ways,” she says. An alliance of more than a dozen companies — including Gilead in Foster City, California, Novartis in Basel, Switzerland, and WuXi AppTec in Shanghai, China — has been working to discover and test antiviral treatments by sharing data about early results and basic science, as well as collaborating on designs for clinical trials. If these group efforts bear fruit, they might continue, says Krofah.

Pharmaceutical companies might also make long-lasting adjustments to their supply chains, says David Simchi-Levi, who studies operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Over the past few decades, drug makers have increasingly shifted their manufacturing away from the United States and Europe to countries such as India and China, which can produce the drugs at lower cost. But over the past few years, many firms have begun to look for ways to diversify their supplies of services and raw materials, to reduce the risk of supply interruptions in the event of a US–China trade war, says Simchi-Levi. The coronavirus outbreak could accelerate that trend. “Some shocks were anticipated, but not at this scale,” says Krofah. “This is going to cause a fundamental re-examination of that risk.”

Momentum for a shift towards virtual clinical trials has been gradually building for years. But progress had been hindered by a lack of clear guidance from regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a reluctance to invest in the technology needed to run such trials — until the pandemic hit, says Cotliar. Companies such as Science 37 are suddenly seeing their popularity skyrocket. “It’s exponentially accelerated the adoption curve of what we were already doing,” Cotliar says. “That’s been a bit surreal.”

At the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, for example, infectious-disease specialist David Boulware and his colleagues conducted a randomized, controlled, virtual trial of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to find out whether it can protect people who are at high risk of contracting COVID-19. The trial, which included more than 800 people and found the treatment had no benefit (D. R. Boulware et al. N. Engl. J. Med. http://doi.org/dxkv; 2020), sent participants medicine by FedEx delivery and monitored their health remotely.

Patient advocates have long pushed for more virtual trials, which ease the burden of clinical-trial participation. If the trend catches on, it could speed up the enrolment of participants — a significant piece of the drug-development timeline.

And now that the pandemic has driven medical centres to set up much-needed technology, and forced the FDA to release guidelines for virtual trials during the pandemic, it is hard to imagine clinical research going back to the way it was before, says Krofah. “We’re going to see this as a new, normal part of clinical research,” she says. “The cat is out of the bag.”||0
2020-06-04||In mid-March, just after restrictions were put in place to slow the spread COVID-19, Dr Nigel Stevenson looked out the window of his Dublin apartment. “It was a beautiful, still evening, the sun was setting and there was no traffic on the roads. It was idyllic,” he recalls. “Then I remembered why it was so quiet, and I thought... that damn virus.”

Stevenson, who leads the Viral Immunology Lab in Trinity’s Biomedical Sciences Institute, knows more about “that damn virus” than most. For more than a decade he has been working on disease-causing viruses, including HIV, Hepatitis C and, more recently, the coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 (from the outbreak in the early 2000s) and MERS (from the outbreak in 2012). Now he has turned his lab’s attention to the pandemic virus, SARS-CoV-2.

His interest? The biochemical dance between an invading virus and the human cell it seeks to hijack, and how understanding those interactions could help us design new therapies to stop infection.

“Some viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, can hide from our immune systems early in the infection, and they can really get entrenched,” he explains. “By understanding how they do that, we could potentially bring the viruses out of hiding and help the immune system to clear the infection early on. That would lead to less disease.”

When the SARS-CoV-2 virus – that causes Covid-19 – gets into our airways, it enters our cells and ejects its genetic material, co-opting the infected cell into making copies of the virus, which then go on to infect other cells.

One way our body defends us against this takeover is by releasing a substance called interferon, Stevenson explains. “Interferon is a really powerful defender, because it activates hundreds of other genes and proteins that effectively stop the virus in its tracks.”

But some viruses can interfere with the interferon response. Stevenson and his Trinity College Dublin colleague Prof Cliona O’Farrelly have previously shown the Hepatitis C virus can block a particular pathway of biochemical signals inside the cell, thereby stopping the cell from “telling” interferon to ramp up the molecular defences. “We could see that the virus degraded this biochemical pathway inside liver and immune cells,” explains Stevenson. “And this blockade meant the body wasn’t able to switch on its normal defences against the virus.”

Stevenson has found other viruses use a similar mechanism to block responses to interferon, among them HIV. “We have been able to show that HIV-1 stops interferon too,” he says. “And we are looking at ways to prevent HIV-1 from doing that, and thereby restore the natural interferon response.”

Then, last year, in a case of spectacularly good timing, PhD student, Yamei Zhang, in Stevenson’s lab started to look at the effect of the original SARS and MERS coronaviruses on the Interferon response. “Our ongoing studies are showing that both the SARS-1 and MERS viruses use a conserved mechanism to block interferon,” Stevenson adds.

When Covid-19 became a serious public health concern, the researchers also turned their attention to SARS-CoV-2. Their analysis of the pandemic virus genome indicates that it too may use this process to suppress response to interferon, as it has a similar interferon-blocking code to the one Stevenson’s lab has studied in its coronavirus “cousins”.

“We are now studying this, because if this is one way through which SARS-CoV-2 evades our immune system, then it’s good news for our battle against this deadly virus,” says Stevenson. “Our lab is already working on ways to restore interferon’s biochemical pathway, so now we can apply these research discoveries to the pandemic virus too.”

Another difficulty in Covid-19 is that when the immune system does respond to the virus later in the infection, it can over-respond in some people, damaging their lungs and other organs. Prof Andrew Bowie, also at Trinity, is trying to figure out the pathway to this response.

Like Stevenson, he has found himself in a good position to focus on SARS-CoV-2. “Last year, we started working with RNA viruses that affect the airways, trying to understand how these viruses trigger an immune response in lung cells,” Bowie says. “And now we can pivot that work to look at how the RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 does this.”

Bowie, along with O’Farrelly and Prof Luke O’Neill, are part of a European project called INITIATE, which explores how disease-causing viruses interact with human cells growing in the lab.

“We are looking at how the airway cells react to the viruses when they meet them, and the kind of inflammatory immune response that follows,” explains Bowie. “We and others have already discovered that viruses prompt a different kind of immune response in lung cells compared to the response we see to bacteria. Now we can look at how the inflammatory immune response gets switched on specifically in response to SARS-CoV-2, and what pathways are involved. It’s a good example of how answering a basic biological question will shed light about what is going on in patients who experience this kind of immune activation in Covid-19.”

Ultimately, we want the answers to those biological questions to translate into better ways to prevent or treat Covid-19. Dr Virginie Gautier at University College Dublin is marshalling her lab’s resources to screen for such answers. Her expertise lies in host-virus interactions, and now she has re-oriented her lab to look at SARS-CoV-2.

“We are interested in the ways that cells respond biochemically to viruses, so that we can identify points of vulnerability that could be targeted by drugs,” explains Gautier, who is a principal investigator at the UCD Centre for Experimental Pathogen Host Research. “We also have a platform set up in the lab where we can apply specific drugs or other agents and see how that affects the virus when infecting the cells.”

With funding through the Health Research Board’s national Covid-19 rapid response call, Gautier is now working with UCD Prof Paddy Mallon to screen for ways to block SARS-CoV-2 using that platform.

“We want to look at drugs that have already been approved for use in the clinic, so they could be repurposed for treating SARS-CoV-2 if they are effective, and we are looking at potential new agents against the virus too,” Gautier says.

Her lab is also helping to provide reagents for hospitals to test patient samples for SARS-CoV-2, she adds. “This pandemic needs us all to work together, to use the insights and systems we have developed for other viruses and focus on this one.”||0
2020-06-04||The UK’s 2008 Climate Change Act has led to a 34% fall in CO 2 emissions by 2019, while real GDP per capita had risen by more than 10% following the crash into the ‘Great Recession’. Can the UK achieve its recent net-zero emissions target by 2050 while still growing? This column describes some speculative routes to such a decarbonised future.

Although much of the modern world is powered by fossil fuels, that was not an inevitable outcome of technology and costs. The first electricity generator in the UK in 1868 was hydro-driven, the first commercial photovoltaic solar panel – building on Edmond Becquerel’s 1839 creation of the first photovoltaic cell – was developed by Charles Fritts in 1881, the first wind turbine to generate electricity was built by James Blyth in 1887, and by the 1930s wind-generated electricity was relatively common on US farms. Moreover, electric cars date back to the 1880s after Thomas Parker built a vehicle with a high-capacity rechargeable battery. Thus, an all-electric-powered society is just going back to a future where we might have been 125 years ago.

The rapidly falling costs of renewable energy sources like solar cells and onshore wind turbines combined with improved storage methods should substantially reduce oil and gas use in electricity production. Offshore wind turbines have also fallen greatly in cost and increased in efficiency over the past two decades so that for the UK they offer a low-cost alternative with the incidental benefit of creating marine reserves and fish sanctuaries. Wind turbines are cheaper than natural gas combined-cycle turbines even before adding the costs of carbon capture and storage.

Solar photovoltaics come next (for the UK) if carbon capture and storage is enforced, though both wind and sun sources require large backup electricity storage systems for, for example, windless nights, which we’ll discuss below. Renewable energy’s share of overall UK electricity generation reached a peak of 60.5% at one stage in April 2020, according to National Grid data.

Coal use has fallen to near zero in the UK since the 2008 Climate Change Act, without obvious aggregate costs (Hendry 2020). However, natural gas usage has increased 3.5-fold since the mid-1980s and still contributes about 140 megatons (Mt) p.a. to CO emissions despite producing less than half those of coal per Btu.

In 2019, the UK government amended the original Climate Change Act target to zero net emissions by 2050. All sources of greenhouse gas emissions must go to a level such that carbon capture and storage, possibly combined with atmospheric CO extraction methods, must remove the rest.

Facing an irreducible non-zero minimum demand for oil and gas (e.g. for chemicals), to achieve zero net emissions before 2050 requires major technological change that almost certainly involves developing current research on avenues to remove (Wemyss 2014) or reuse existing CO as a fuel (Stanford University 2019). ‘Net zero’ is an excellent target but incredibly difficult to achieve and as yet, there is no sensible UK strategy to do so – so we now suggest some speculative routes.

To meet the net-zero target, natural gas–use must be reduced to near zero, like coal. Natural gas is mainly used for electricity production and household indoor- and water heating. The former could be handled in part by increased renewable sources. Household natural-gas (and some oil) usage could be reduced by increased taxes encouraging the adoption of solar panels and, for example, air heat pumps.

More radically, the UK could switch back from a national gas distribution system using natural gas to one based on hydrogen, possibly made by electrolysis when there is spare renewable electricity. The UK had a hydrogen-based gas distribution system prior to 1969, but the switch to natural gas required all household equipment to be converted from ones that burned coal gas (which is composed of about 50% hydrogen) to those that burned natural gas (which is mainly methane).

With ever-improving technologies and cost reductions in renewable electricity generation, a near-zero target for natural gas over the next 30 years should be possible without reducing GDP growth – perhaps even increasing growth with new opportunities.

However, as no future technology is certain, more research should be devoted to developing safe small modular nuclear reactors (World Nuclear Association 2020) based on the well-developed nuclear-powered engines in submarines. Variants of small modular nuclear reactors such as molten-salt waste-burners https://www.seaborg.co/ may be able to use non-fissionable thorium or the ‘spent’ uranium fuel rods from older reactors, helping to reduce the serious problem of transuranic-waste disposal. Part of those disposal-cost savings should be put towards the building of small modular nuclear reactors, perhaps supplemented by reallocating the £40 billion saved by abandoning the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station.

Even over our horizon of 30 years, nuclear fusion seems unlikely to be a key energy contributor despite many developments, such as increasing output efficiency (Bennett 2017) and reducing internal damage to tokamak materials from helium (Galeon 2017), which might then be collected, offsetting a potential shortage.

Reducing oil use in transport to zero will take longer following current strategies, even with more efficient engines (diesel being phased out completely given its toxic pollutants), and much higher taxes on gasoline. Without a major improvement in lithium-ion-battery-powered electric vehicles, their relatively short journey capacity despite taking a non-negligible time to recharge discourages the replacement of internal combustion engines.

However, recent advances have been made in understanding the properties of graphene, with potentially large falls in its cost of production (see ‘graphene in a flash’ from plastic waste, Williams 2020). Graphene nanotubes can act as electrode super-capacitors, and there may be something like a variant of Moore’s law (which states that processing power of computers doubles every two years) that could lead to cost reductions stemming from a large increase in their production.

Imagine sandwiching an array of graphene nanotubes (Sammed et al. 2020) between two Faraday cages in a prefabricated modular unit fitted to a vehicle’s roof (perhaps even retrofitted on existing car roofs) to power an electric motor, so the vehicle becomes the battery. Graphene nanotubes seem capable of rapid charging and should be able to sustain viable distances on a single charge.

Moreover, if such electric vehicles are successful, mandating them to be plugged in when not in use will translate into a vast electric storage system for no additional investment, with cars acting as the National Grid’s storage. Thus, renewable sources of electricity could be widely adopted without worrying about the security of supply.

There are undoubtedly many technical issues that need to be solved before such a system could work in practice, but there is much going on – such as developing 2-dimensional tri-layers of graphene (Graphene-info 2020) as an insulator, superconductor, and magnet.

Several steps are possible for the UK to rapidly advance research on GNTs: (1) offer EPSRC significant additional funding for a general call to research the topic; (2) approach Manchester University directly as a world leader in graphene research with two Nobel Laureates; (3) offer a world-wide prize of £10m+ for the first car to successfully meet appropriate criteria, with the patent to the UK Government; (4) contact major UK motor manufacturers of electric vehicles for interest and support; (5) make the call more general as other light materials could play equivalent roles as sources of electricity. Other steps include research on smart meters to be able to register both payments for taking power from fast chargers, and recording kwhs withdrawn from the grid and needing replaced for free; and contemplating a grid of fast chargers.

The potential benefits of such a power source would be huge as a ‘sensitive intervention point’ (Farmer et al. 2019 cite the UK’s Climate Change Act of 2008 as a timely example with a large effect).

By not demonising road transport for its CO footprint and dangerous pollution, cars with internal combustion engines could be replaced at a rate matching obsolescence and the increased need for storage from the extension of renewables. The basics of electric engines are established, so employment can be maintained in vehicle manufacture and many of its ancillary industries rebased on graphene nanotubes. Two side benefits are a major reduction in both mining for lithium and later disposal or recycling of the resulting toxic battery waste; and eliminating the need for expensive catalytic converters, markedly cutting production costs, eliminating a target for theft (which then exacerbates air pollution), and reducing palladium mining.

Indirect consequences could solve the UK rail system’s problem of a lack of electrification across much of the network, by replacing diesel-electric trains with graphene-nanotube-supplied electric ones, although some progress is also being made with hydrogen-driven trains in Germany and the UK (University of Birmingham, n.d.). As graphene nanotubes are so light, they could stimulate a large increase in economical electric-powered aircraft (Travierso 2013).

Agriculture, construction, chemical industry, and waste management look more problematic, although there have been some improvements in efficiency. Inner-city underground (Frangoul 2018) and vertical farms (Despommier 2009) economise on water, fertiliser, and energy – partly from transport reductions – and are increasingly viable given the falls in costs of LED lighting.

There is research on altering farm-mammal diets to reduce methane emissions, including adding dietary fumaric acid (from plants like lichen and Ic||0
2020-06-04||The health costs of the Covid-19 pandemic are considerable, and the economic and social costs of lockdown policies are even larger. This column calls for an innovative mechanism to foster the development of a vaccine against Covid-19. Governments would commit now to buy back any patent obtained by a private firm which would discover an effective vaccine, at a price of €60 billion, and would grant the right to produce the vaccine to any firm able to do so. This mechanism would provide strong incentives to innovate, while protecting firms from the political risk of expropriation.

On 4 May 2020, a pledging conference convened by the EU raised €7.4 billion in funding for Covid-19 vaccines, treatment, and diagnostic research. Leading funders included the European Commission, Germany, France, the UK, the World Bank, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation – even the pop singer Madonna.

As of 15 May, the Covid-19 pandemic has caused more than 300,000 deaths throughout the world. This pandemic may be the first major global event in the history of humankind: all countries are hit, and within each country, entire populations are affected negatively by the pandemic itself, or potentially positively by public interventions to fight against its diffusion.

For locked-down countries, production losses have been estimated at 30% of usual activity (OECD 2020). EU countries pledged to donate €4 billion, but each week of lockdown may cost €60 billion in foregone production. Some countries which have begun to soften their lockdown policies may have to reimpose strict measures, at tremendous economic cost.

Beyond the direct healthcare costs of the pandemic and the human costs of deaths and suffering, the main economic consequences are not due to the virus itself, but to policies aimed at flattening the curve. In April 2020, half the world population was confined in some way.

According to the OECD (2020), the direct costs are already enormous: the EU27 may have lost at least €280 billion in foregone production in the first month of lockdown. Baldwin et al. (2020) and Gourinchas (2020) observe the GDP loss could be tremendous if this lockdown triggers a full-scale recession.

One major issue with ending policies of containment is that we don't know if they will need to be reactivated in the near future. Successful lockdowns bring new infections to zero in a population, but with a low share of individuals who have gained immunity. In Europe this share ranges from 0.4% in Norway to 9.8% in Italy (Flaxman et al. 2020). This possibly underestimates true immunity, but herd immunity requires levels of 50% to 66%.

There is a significant probability that new imported cases will trigger new epidemic waves in Europe. And so epidemiologists argue that suppression strategies will need to be maintained until vaccines or effective treatments become available (Walker et al. 2020). Even currently undefined (and controversial) policies that would seek to balance containment with the need to restart and maintain economic production may still induce substantial production losses.

Such policies could be avoided if a vaccine were available and could be produced in large quantities. Early economic epidemiology papers have shown that complete eradication is very difficult to attain (e.g. Geoffard and Philipson 1996), but many infectious diseases are kept under control today through vaccination. If a sufficiently large proportion of the population is vaccinated, we potentially achieve herd immunity by this route. Even if a vaccine fails to eradicate Covid-19, it will be a major tool to reduce prevalence.

The economic gains from the rapid creation and manufacture of a vaccine have been noticed by investment fund managers. The Financial Times reported on 24 April that BlackRock, Fidelity International, Aviva Investors, Janus Henderson and Amundi all wanted drug companies to collaborate with their competitors to speed up its availability.

According to Le et al. (2020) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, 115 vaccine candidates were in development on 8 April, although even in the most optimistic case, this development will take more than a year. Researchers and their employers may be motivated by the desire to contribute to human wellbeing – but money may be important too, if only because it allows innovators to throw more people and resources at the research. Those financial incentives to innovate are generally determined by the expectation of a temporary patent monopoly.

Though the 4 May conference was indeed a great success, the total amount pledged so far still represents only a small fraction of the economic costs induced by the pandemic. Though a substantial share of that amount will be targeted towards vaccine research, this research is also sensitive to the political risk of expropriation.

An example: one week after the conference, Paul Hudson, CEO of Sanofi, said that the subsidy granted by the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to finance its vaccine research programme came with a commitment by Sanofi to give priority for a vaccine to US customers. In response, French authorities and members of the European Parliament countered that any vaccine would have to be equitably available to all. Many MEPs went further and expressed support for compulsory licensing of any vaccine.

Vaccine research takes time and resources, and is a risky enterprise. The chance is high that even if a vaccine is discovered by a pharmaceutical firm, political pressures will prevent this firm from making profits by the usual route of obtaining a patent and selling the vaccine at a high price.

For a Covid-19 vaccine, the social and political pressures for an exception to patent protection will be considerable. It is hard to believe that some, if not most, countries will not invoke Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement, enabling a government to use compulsory licensing to allow a local firm to produce a patented product without the consent of the patent owner, or to import the product from another country.

Under TRIPS, governments must still pay an 'adequate' fee to the patent holder. But if the emergency is extremely urgent, they don't need to try to agree a voluntary license. In short, a government can impose its own price.

It's a safe bet that Covid-19 satisfies these conditions and so, for a private firm, the risk of expropriation seems particularly important. Even if governments do not activate compulsory licensing, political pressures and healthcare budget constraints mean that firms will be under pressure to lower prices.

Many major pharmaceutical companies are already dedicating risky research efforts to find a vaccine against Covid-19, reducing investment in other drugs or vaccines. But these hold-up risks may reduce their effort. Stockholders may gripe if there's a risk that a firm will succeed but not be granted a patent, or that it gets a patent but is unable to recoup R&D spend.

Kremer et al. (2020) and Athey et al. (2020) have argued for advanced market commitment. This was intended to foster research on diseases common in developing countries, but it could apply here. Donors pledge to top up payments for newly introduced vaccine meeting technical benchmarks, conditional on the firm’s setting the price close to marginal cost. Three pneumococcal vaccines have been developed encouraged by such a pledge and 150 million children in poor countries have been immunised, saving an estimated 700,000 lives.

But, if production costs are difficult to observe, the commitment to sell at marginal cost is impossible to verify. This generates a political risk: NGOs campaigning for lower drugs prices and transparency in price-setting would put pressure on any patent-holder to reduce prices, even those claiming to sell at production cost.

A more standard way to come close to marginal cost pricing is to rely on competition between producers. However, since competition brings profits to zero, financial incentives for research must come from another instrument.

One way to get around these issues while providing incentives for vaccine research would be for donors to pledge to buy the patent at a high value. They would then allow private firms to produce the vaccine without having to pay any patent fees. The patent would have high value, but it can be thought as a way to front-load the costs that would be borne in future by health insurance schemes, which in European countries are mostly funded by payroll taxes – revenues from which have already been severely damaged by the drop in economic activity (Baker 2020). If pledged by the EU, such a commitment would also speed up the availability of the vaccine, as the producer will not have to negotiate a price in each country.

Governments could even set up such a scheme as an option offered to pharmaceutical firms. The patent holder could still decide to remain the owner of the patent and to negotiate market access, and prices, with each healthcare financing institution.

This could be financed by the Recovery Fund announced by the European Commission which, according to the European Parliament, could be as large as €2 trillion. A commitment by the EU to buy a vaccine patent would be a clear and transparent mechanism that would reduce the political risk of expropriation, could foster investment in R&D, and will speed up market access.

We could argue that an investment that could hasten the end of containment by just one week in Europe would be socially profitable if it costs less than €60 billion This amount provides a lower bound for the social value of a vaccine.

A commitment to buy for, say, €60 billion seems an enormous sum; but if this shortens a future lockdown by a single week, it would be an efficient use of public money.

2020-06-04||Log on to Twitter for a masterclass in gall. What claims to be the account of Iran’s supreme leader shows his concern for America’s downtrodden. The Turkish president is “deeply saddened” at their lives under an “unjust order”. As for China, one official opts merely to quote the late George Floyd. “I can’t breathe,” said the man whose death after police arrest has set off US-wide protests.

America’s internal schisms are being used against it, and used well, with the soft touch and irony that autocrats are meant to lack. But then there is so much to work with.

The dividedness of the US – racial, material, political – is aired thoroughly enough as a domestic blight. It is the effect on its foreign policy that can get lost in the anguish. If the US is riven, it must also be hampered in its outward actions. And nowhere will it suffer more than in the superpower duel.

The US-China rift is so cheaply likened to the cold war that we forget how much more unified America was back then. When it took on the Soviets, it was fresh from the bonding trauma of the second World War. Republicans and Democrats did not just have bipartisan manners, but shared policies: a mixed economy, anti-isolationism, foot-dragging on civil rights.

Immigration had been too low for too long to test the country’s sense of itself. Trust in government was so high as to implicate Americans in Old World deference. The distribution of incomes was much flatter than it is now. Politics rarely spilled on to the street.

With all the due caveats about silent tensions (and, in McCarthyism, loud ones), the US that set out on the cold war was a nation of almost quaint togetherness. It could be mobilised for an open-ended contest against a far-off rival.

Achieving the same trick now would tax a Lincoln or a Roosevelt. It is not just a week’s urban unrest that has to be overcome, but two or three decades of calcified partisanship. If another cold war is afoot, the US goes into it with less of the cohesion that primed it for the first. The best it can hope is that the causal link runs the other way: that an external foe is what brings citizens together. If so, the process is slow in working.

As they consider the inflamed streets, Americans of some vintage will shiver with memories of the late-1960s. It is important to follow that thought a bit further. What the turmoil over civil rights and the Vietnam war ultimately brought was a change in world affairs: the cold-war breather we know as detente.

The US saw that it could not tussle with the Soviets while its own house was in such disrepair. It had to sue, if not for peace then for a modus vivendi, at least until it felt robust again. Foreign policy could not endlessly buck domestic weakness.

Nor can it now. If anything, the US is even less cohesive in 2020. Detente-era Washington was still a bipartisan place, with Republicans renouncing their own president, Richard Nixon, and some supreme court judges being confirmed near-unanimously. It is now a pit of bad faith. Nor was income inequality such a sore point before the market reforms of the 1980s. It is now entangled with the race question and the Covid-19 pandemic.

For reasons of pride or strategy, confronting China might be still be right. But it matters that it coincides with the most fractured time in national life for half a century. The least to be said is that those who will the confrontation should not stoke the disunity.

And so to the president. Donald Trump did not etch the faultlines into his society, but he picks at them with rare abandon. We know well enough that he will not desist out of good conscience. Much odder is that he rejects the geopolitical case for doing so.

If he wants the US to bed down for an indefinite struggle against China, he must know that it cannot also be so nakedly at odds with itself. The president can have discord at home, or he can have a tenable showdown abroad. It is ever harder to see how he can have both. A true hawk would be sweetly emollient in domestic politics.

Instead, the president touts a bible (unconvincingly) and pledges to get rough (convincingly). Protesters are dispersed not far from the White House. In Washington, the ambient sound comes from vigilant helicopters. The past week is said to have been Trump’s most divisive yet. As such, it was also the worst for his foreign goals. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020||1

Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB,

Frankfurt am Main, 4 June 2020

Jump to the transcript of the questions and answers

Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.

Incoming information confirms that the euro area economy is experiencing an unprecedented contraction. There has been an abrupt drop in economic activity as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the measures to contain it. Severe job and income losses and exceptionally elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook have led to a significant fall in consumer spending and investment. While survey data and real-time indicators for economic activity have shown some signs of a bottoming-out alongside the gradual easing of the containment measures, the improvement has so far been tepid compared with the speed at which the indicators plummeted in the preceding two months. The June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections see growth declining at an unprecedented pace in the second quarter of this year, before rebounding again in the second half, crucially helped by the sizeable support from fiscal and monetary policy. Nonetheless, the projections entail a substantial downward revision to both the level of economic activity and the inflation outlook over the whole projection horizon, though the baseline is surrounded by an exceptional degree of uncertainty. While headline inflation is suppressed by lower energy prices, price pressures are expected to remain subdued on account of the sharp decline in real GDP and the associated significant increase in economic slack.

In line with its mandate, the Governing Council is determined to ensure the necessary degree of monetary accommodation and a smooth transmission of monetary policy across sectors and countries. Accordingly, we decided on a set of monetary policy measures to support the economy during its gradual reopening and to safeguard medium-term price stability.

First, the Governing Council decided to increase the envelope for the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) by €600 billion to a total of €1,350 billion. In response to the pandemic-related downward revision to inflation over the projection horizon, the PEPP expansion will further ease the general monetary policy stance, supporting funding conditions in the real economy, especially for businesses and households. The purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. This allows us to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy.

Second, we decided to extend the horizon for net purchases under the PEPP to at least the end of June 2021. In any case, we will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until the Governing Council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over.

Third, the Governing Council decided to reinvest the maturing principal payments from securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2022. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.

Fourth, net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion, together with the purchases under the additional €120 billion temporary envelope until the end of the year. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates.

Fifth, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.

Sixth, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.

Together with the substantial monetary policy stimulus already in place, today’s decisions will support liquidity and funding conditions in the economy, help to sustain the flow of credit to households and firms, and contribute to maintaining favourable financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions, in order to underpin the recovery of the economy from the coronavirus fallout. At the same time, in the current rapidly evolving economic environment, the Governing Council remains fully committed to doing everything necessary within its mandate to support all citizens of the euro area through this extremely challenging time. This applies first and foremost to our role in ensuring that our monetary policy is transmitted to all parts of the economy and to all jurisdictions in the pursuit of our price stability mandate. The Governing Council, therefore, continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.

Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The latest economic indicators and survey results confirm a sharp contraction of the euro area economy and rapidly deteriorating labour market conditions. The coronavirus pandemic and the necessary containment measures have severely affected both the manufacturing and services sectors, taking a toll on the productive capacity of the euro area economy and on domestic demand. In the first quarter of 2020, when containment measures were only in place from mid-March in most countries, euro area real GDP decreased by 3.8%, quarter on quarter. Information from surveys, high-frequency indicators and incoming hard data all point to a further significant contraction of real GDP in the second quarter. Most recent indicators suggest some bottoming-out of the downturn in May as parts of the economy gradually reopen. Accordingly, euro area activity is expected to rebound in the third quarter as the containment measures are eased further, supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a resumption in global activity, although the overall speed and scale of the rebound remains highly uncertain.

This assessment is also broadly reflected in the June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. In the baseline scenario of the projections, annual real GDP is expected to fall by 8.7% in 2020 and to rebound by 5.2% in 2021 and by 3.3% in 2022. Compared with the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised substantially downwards by 9.5 percentage points in 2020 and revised upwards by 3.9 percentage points in 2021 and 1.9 percentage points in 2022.

Given the exceptional uncertainty currently surrounding the outlook, the projections also include two alternative scenarios, which we will publish on our website following this press conference. In general, the extent of the contraction and the recovery will depend crucially on the duration and the effectiveness of the containment measures, the success of policies to mitigate the adverse impact on incomes and employment, and the extent to which supply capacity and domestic demand are permanently affected. Overall, the Governing Council sees the balance of risks around the baseline projection to the downside.

According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation decreased to 0.1% in May, down from 0.3% in April, mainly on account of lower energy price inflation. On the basis of current and futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline somewhat further over the coming months and to remain subdued until the end of the year. Over the medium term, weaker demand will put downward pressure on inflation, which will be only partially offset by upward pressures related to supply constraints. Market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have remained at depressed levels. While survey-based indicators of inflation expectations have declined over the short and medium term, longer-term expectations have been less affected.

This assessment is also reflected in the June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation in the baseline scenario at 0.3% in 2020, 0.8% in 2021 and 1.3% in 2022. Compared with the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP inflation has been revised downwards by 0.8 percentage points in 2020, 0.6 percentage points in 2021 and 0.3 percentage points in 2022.

Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth increased to 8.3% in April 2020, from 7.5% in March. Strong money growth reflects bank credit creation, which is driven to a large extent by the acute liquidity needs in the economy. Moreover, high economic uncertainty is triggering a shift towards money holdings for precautionary reasons. In this environment, the narrow monetary aggregate M1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth.

Developments in loans to the private sector continued to be shaped by the impact of the coronavirus on economic activity. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations rose further to 6.6% in April 2020, up from 5.5% in March, reflecting firms’ need to finance their ongoing expenditures and working capital in the ||0
2020-06-05||Julian Assange​ was running WikiLeaks in 2010 when it released a vast hoard of US government documents revealing details of American political, military and diplomatic operations. With extracts published by the New York Times, the Guardian, Der Spiegel, Le Monde and El País, the archive provided deeper insight into the international workings of the US state than anything seen since Daniel Ellsberg gave the Pentagon Papers to the media in 1971. But today Ellsberg is celebrated as the patron saint of whistleblowers while Assange is locked in a cell in London’s Belmarsh maximum security prison for 23 and a half hours a day. In this latest phase of the American authorities’ ten-year pursuit of Assange, he is fighting extradition to the US. Court hearings to determine whether the extradition request will be granted have been delayed until September by the Covid-19 pandemic. In the US he faces one charge of computer hacking and 17 counts under the Espionage Act of 1917. If he is convicted, the result could be a prison sentence of 175 years.

I was in Kabul when I first heard about the WikiLeaks revelations, which confirmed much of what I and other reporters suspected, or knew but could not prove, about US activities in Afghanistan and Iraq. The trove was immense: some 251,287 diplomatic cables, more than 400,000 classified army reports from the Iraq War and 90,000 from the war in Afghanistan. Rereading these documents now I’m struck again by the constipated military-bureaucratic prose, with its sinister, dehumanising acronyms. Killing people is referred to as an EOF (‘Escalation of Force’), something that happened frequently at US military checkpoints when nervous US soldiers directed Iraqi drivers to stop or go with complex hand signals that nobody understood. What this could mean for Iraqis is illustrated by brief military reports such as the one headed ‘Escalation of Force by 3/8 NE Fallujah: I CIV KIA, 4 CIV WIA’. Decoded, it describes the moment when a woman in a car was killed and her husband and three daughters wounded at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Fallujah, forty miles west of Baghdad. The US marine on duty opened fire because he was ‘unable to determine the occupants of the vehicle due to the reflection of the sun coming off the windshield’. Another report marks the moment when US soldiers shot dead a man who was ‘creeping up behind their sniper position’, only to learn later that he was their own unit’s interpreter.

These reports are the small change of war. But collectively they convey its reality far better than even the most well-informed journalistic accounts. Those two shootings were a thousand times repeated, though the reports were rare in admitting that the victims were civilians. More usually, the dead were automatically identified as ‘terrorists’ caught in the act, regardless of evidence to the contrary. The most famous of the WikiLeaks discoveries concerned an event in Baghdad on 12 July 2007 during which the US military claimed to have killed a dozen terrorists. But the incident had been filmed by the gun camera of the US Apache helicopter that had carried out the shootings, and the people it targeted were all civilians. Much was known about the killings because among the dead were two local journalists working for Reuters. It was known, too, that such a video existed, but the Pentagon refused to release it despite a Freedom of Information Act request. Appalled by what the video revealed about the way the US was conducting its war on terror, and appalled by the contents of the thousands of reports and cables it was stored alongside, a junior US intelligence analyst called Bradley Manning, who later changed her legal gender and became Chelsea Manning, released the entire archive to WikiLeaks.

The video still has the power to shock. The two helicopter pilots exchange banter about the slaughter in the street below: ‘Ha, ha, I hit them,’ one says. ‘Oh yeah, look at those dead bastards,’ the other says. They have mistaken the camera held by one of the journalists for a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, unlikely though it was that armed insurgents would stand in the open in Baghdad with a US helicopter hovering overhead. They shoot again at the wounded as one of them, probably the Reuters assistant Saeed Chmagh, crawls towards a van that has stopped to rescue them. When the pilots are told over the radio that they have killed a number of Iraqi civilians and wounded two children, one of them says: ‘Well, it’s their fault for bringing their kids into the battle.’

The WikiLeaks documents exposed the way the US, as the world’s sole superpower, really conducted its wars – something that the military and political establishments saw as a blow to their credibility and legitimacy. There were some devastating revelations, the helicopter video among them, but many of the secrets uncovered weren’t particularly significant or indeed very secret. In themselves they don’t explain the degree of rage WikiLeaks provoked in the US government and its allies. This was a response to Assange’s assault on their monopoly control of sensitive state information, which they saw as an essential prop to their authority. Making such information public, as Assange and WikiLeaks had done, weaponised freedom of expression: if disclosures of this kind went unpunished and became the norm, it would radically shift the balance of power between government and society – and especially the media – in favour of the latter. It is the US government’s determination to defend its ongoing monopoly, rather than the supposed damage done by the release of the secrets themselves, that has motivated it to pursue Assange and to seek to discredit both him and WikiLeaks.

This campaign has been unrelenting and has had a fair measure of success, despite the fact that most of the charges made against Assange are demonstrably untrue. Regarding the release of documents, there were two lines of attack. First, Assange and WikiLeaks were accused of revealing information that endangered or led to the deaths of Americans or their allies in Iraq and Afghanistan. Second, they were accused of having injured the US state in general through activities amounting to espionage, which should be punished as such. Much more damaging to Assange, however, and to the whole WikiLeaks project, were the allegations of rape made against him in Sweden, also in 2010. This led to a prosecutorial investigation lasting nearly ten years, which was dropped three times and three times restarted before finally being abandoned last November as the statute of limitations approached, beyond which no charges could be brought.

The result is that Assange has become a pariah. Lost is the fact that he and WikiLeaks did what all journalists should do, which is to make important information available to the public, enabling people to make evidence-based judgments about the world around them and, in particular, about the actions of their governments. Given the constant drum beat of attacks on Assange from so many directions it can be hard to remember that in 2010 WikiLeaks won a great victory for freedom of expression and against state secrecy, and that the US government and its allies have made every effort to reverse it.

The early attempts to discredit Assange focused on trying to prove that the WikiLeaks disclosures had led directly to the deaths of US agents and informants. The Pentagon put a great deal of effort into substantiating this allegation: it set up an Information Review Task Force headed by a senior counterintelligence officer, Brigadier General Robert Carr, which studied the impact of the revelations and sought to produce a list of people who might have been killed because of the information the cables contained. Carr later described the extent of his task force’s failure, in testimony given at Manning’s sentencing hearing in July 2013. After long research, his team of 120 counterintelligence officers hadn’t been able to find a single person, among the thousands of American agents and secret sources in Afghanistan and Iraq, who could be shown to have died because of the disclosures. Carr told the court that at one point his task force seemed to be getting somewhere: the Taliban claimed to have killed a US informant identified in the WikiLeaks cables. It was a sign of desperation on the part of the counterintelligence officers that in seeking evidence against WikiLeaks they were reduced to citing the Taliban as a source. And, as Carr admitted during the defence cross-examination, the Taliban turned out to be lying: ‘The name of the individual killed was not in the [WikiLeaks] disclosures.’ Despite all this, the lawyer representing the US government at Assange’s extradition hearings in London earlier this year still argued that Assange had put the lives of US sources in Iraq and Afghanistan at risk.

In Kabul in 2010, just after my first look at the diplomatic cables WikiLeaks had released, I happened to be meeting an American official for an off the record talk about the situation in Afghanistan. I asked him for his thoughts on the cables; he replied by asking what classification code appeared at the top of the pages I’d seen. When I told him, he was dismissive about the degree to which the documents really contained deeply held secrets, classified though they may be. He explained that the US government wasn’t so naive as to believe that information stored on a database to which as many as half a million people had access – one of whom turned out to be Private Manning – was likely to stay confidential for very long. Known as Siprnet (Secret Internet Protocol Router Network), the database had originally been the sole property of the Pentagon but was used more widely in the aftermath of 9/11, when it became clear that parts of the US bureaucracy had valuable information that other parts didn’t know about. Siprnet was the answer to the problem of insufficient sharing: an ele||1

Meet Peinaleopolynoe elvisi, a newly described species of species of deep-sea worm whose iridescent scales evoke glittery-jumpsuit-era musical icon Elvis Presley. Four such stunning species were collected from the bottom of the eastern Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and an area near Costa Rica, using a crewed research submarine and remotely operated vehicles. Researchers used DNA sequencing to place all four in the Peinaleopolynoe genus, a group of scale worms distantly related to earthworms.See more of the month’s sharpest science shots, selected by Nature’s photo team.

New technology platforms collected more data on the oceans in 2018 than was gathered during the entire twentieth century. This is the kind of real-time information that we need to protect our oceans and those who sail on them — but it is scattered, warn ten ocean scientists. They call for improvements in how we collect, share and access that data to power a global response to climate change, overfishing and pollution.

What it will take to save corals

Researchers are investigating last-resort conservation measures to help corals to adapt to hotter, more acidic oceans caused by climate change. For example, scientists in the Florida Keys are trying to maintain the reef system by hand-rearing coral samples that have survived the pollution and rising temperatures naturally. Expanding marine protected areas can help to buy time for these ‘underwater forests’ — and the wildlife and livelihoods that depend on them. But scientists emphasize that these innovations will not be enough unless global leaders support them with urgent action to slow the rate of global warming.

Since the early Space Age, researchers have studied what it would take for humans to survive long-term either in space or on another planet, and have even grown lettuce on the International Space Station and gotten a seed to sprout on the Moon. Experts — who often admit they look to science fiction for inspiration — say it will be crucial to save human excrement to use as fertilizer. “That’s your starter kit, what you need to get started in the soil,” says ecologist Wieger Wamelink. “Actually, The Martian is totally correct there.

2020-06-05||Two weeks after a high-profile paper in The Lancet1 reported that the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine might be dangerous to patients with COVID-19, three of its four authors have retracted the work because they were unable to independently verify their data set, a large proprietary collection of electronic health records analysed by Surgisphere, a US company.

On the same day, 4 June, the researchers and other co-authors retracted a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)2, for the same reason. That study, published a month ago, had looked at the impact of certain heart medications on people with COVID-19, and found no safety concerns.

Scientists say the affair raises serious questions about the way researchers and journals evaluate the data underlying papers that they publish, and may complicate the effort to trial drugs during the coronavirus pandemic.

“This whole event is catastrophic — it is problematic for the journals involved, it is problematic for the integrity of science, it is problematic for medicine, and it is problematic for the notion of clinical trials and evidence generation,” says Ian Kerridge, a bioethicist at the University of Sydney, Australia.

Both papers relied on proprietary data analysed from electronic health records that were apparently gathered from hundreds of hospitals around the world by Surgisphere. But after critics raised questions about the studies, the firm did not make its raw data available to third-party auditors for validation. According to the retraction notice in the Lancet, Surgisphere was concerned that transferring the data would violate "client agreements and confidentiality requirements".

“Since we do not have the ability to verify the primary data or primary data source, I no longer have confidence in the origination and veracity of the data, nor the findings they have led to,” said Mandeep Mehra, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, who was the lead author on both studies.

Sapan Desai, the founder of Surgisphere, in Chicago, Illinois, and a co-author of the studies, declined to comment to Nature on the retractions and on concerns about the quality of the data behind the studies. Desai signed the NEJM retraction but not the Lancet one.

After the Lancet study appeared, some regulators had paused enrolment in clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. The drug, which is cheap and easy to administer, has been widely endorsed in the pandemic, including by US President Donald Trump, despite scant evidence of its effectiveness. Some of the halted trials, including one led by the World Health Organization, are now starting again. But researchers say they’ve lost time and that enthusiasm to take part in the trials may be waning.

A third study authored by Desai, Mehra and others that used Surgisphere data, which claimed to find a large reduction in COVID-19 mortality when patients were given the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin, has disappeared from the social-sciences preprint server SSRN, where it was first posted on 6 April; a second version was posted on 19 April. Mehra told Nature that he removed the study because he "did not feel it was ready for peer review".

Although the paper was not published in a peer-reviewed journal, it has nonetheless contributed to a surge in the popularity of ivermectin in South America, says Carlos Chaccour of the Barcelona Institute for Global Health in Spain, who is running a clinical trial of ivermectin and had raised questions about the preprint’s data.

Bioethicists say the retractions, and the pulled preprint, raise questions not only about the quality and nature of Surgisphere's data, but also about why the paper’s other authors agreed to work with a large data set they couldn’t validate, and how the work passed peer review at prestigious medical journals.

The hydroxychloroquine study, published on 22 May, had purportedly analysed electronic health records gathered on 96,000 patients in 671 hospitals across six continents. But critics soon raised questions about oddities in the data, and asked for more details on its origins. By 28 May, 120 researchers had signed a letter to The Lancet highlighting their concerns. The questions also cast doubt on the NEJM study, which relied on Surgisphere data that apparently covered almost 9,000 patients across 169 hospitals.

Mehra says he and other co-authors asked for an independent audit of the data in both papers from Medical Technology & Practice Patterns Institute (MTPPI), a health-care data research institute in Bethesda, Maryland. But on 3 June, Mehra says, MTPPI told them that Surgisphere would not share the data “because of agreements with its clients and the fact that the documents contain confidential information”. Mehra and his co-authors asked for retractions.

Before they published the studies, researchers and journals should have asked more questions about how so comprehensive a data set had been gathered from hospitals across the world in the middle of a pandemic, says Wendy Rogers, a bioethicist at Macquarie University in Sydney. “It is always easier with hindsight,” she says, “but in general with the COVID-19 research, there has been such a rush that all sorts of really abysmal papers are getting published.”

Researchers testing hydroxychloroquine in large clinical trials say they’re worried that the publicity around the Lancet findings may make it harder to complete their research, even though the paper has now been retracted. “We’re hearing that people just aren’t interested in hydroxychloroquine,” says David Smith, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Diego, who is helping to run a trial funded by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to test the drug in people with COVID-19 who have not been hospitalized. “The retraction won’t get anywhere near as much news as the original study,” he says. “We may never get an answer about treatment with hydroxychloroquine.”

Most data on hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 has come from in vitro studies or small clinical trials. On 5 June, however, researchers with a large randomized UK trial, called RECOVERY, announced that their data on more than 4,600 hospitalized patients indicated that hydroxychloroquine didn't reduce the risk of death, and they were stopping that arm of the trial. And a randomized, controlled study in 820 people reported on 3 June that the drug was not effective in preventing infection among people who were at high risk of infection following exposure to someone with COVID-193. In contrast to the retracted Lancet paper, the studies found no evidence of toxicity to the heart from hydroxychloroquine treatment.

Those findings don’t rule out possible benefits from hydroxychloroquine in other settings, says Joseph Cheriyan, a clinical pharmacologist at the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in the United Kingdom, where trials testing the drug were halted pending a safety review after the Lancet paper. (One has since resumed.) “The only way we’re going to know is if we do the trials, and what is frustrating is that this article has essentially delayed us,” he says.

It is not uncommon for studies that use large data sets to be published without external scrutiny of the raw data, says Smith. But an exception to this is when the paper is expected to have particularly high impact, as in the Lancet case. In this instance, he says, it appears that extra-careful review was skipped. “It’s a rush right now,” he says. “We are desperate for knowledge, and maybe we’re skipping over some of our tried-and-true checks.”

Both The Lancet and the NEJM said their peer review processes were confidential, and that they could not give details about how quickly the papers were reviewed. “The article had external peer review and statistical review, as well as scientific and manuscript editing. However, as we would do with any incident of this type, we are reviewing our procedures, including how we assess research analyzing large datasets based on electronic medical record data," said an NEJM spokesperson.

Surgisphere’s ivermectin preprint may have a longer life. The Peruvian government included the drug in its national treatment guidelines a few days after a white paper cited the SSRN preprint, Chaccour says, and a week after that, Bolivia added ivermectin to its treatment guidelines, citing the situation in Peru. Paraguay has issued restrictions on the sale of ivermectin because of high demand.

After Chaccour gave a talk about ivermectin to the Peruvian Academy of Sciences, streamed on Facebook, he says he gets texts almost every day from people saying that they have an infected family member and can obtain formulations of ivermectin intended for use in animals, not people. “They send me a photo of a veterinary formulation and ask me, ‘Would you mind telling me what dose we should use?’” he says. “It is broadly available and people are broadly desperate and this could lead to misuse.”

Because the two versions of the preprint were not published in a journal, there is no retraction mechanism to limit their long reach, Chaccour worries. “Who retracts this ivermectin ghost in Latin America?” he says. “There’s no high-profile journal saying this was wrong.”||1
2020-06-05||The Chief Executive Leadership Institute’s Mayors College and CEO Summit, long planned for June 3, went on as planned, but in a new format—an online discussion, open to the public—and with a new theme: racism and the civil unrest sweeping the United States after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police.

“I had to pivot in real time to address the—literally—burning social issues of the day,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, founder and CEO of the Chief Executive Leadership Institute.

 

 Several times a year, the CEO Summit brings together corporate and government leaders and leading academics to discuss the role of business in navigating the day’s most pressing issues; the annual Mayors College convenes mayors of middle-sized and large cities from both parties.

Both events are typically in-person, closed-door gatherings, allowing for frank discussion among high-profile leaders.

“We were about to cancel,” said Sonnenfeld, Yale SOM’s senior associate dean for leadership studies and the Lester Crown Professor in the Practice of Management, “but so many top leaders requested we continue, even without the usual intimate, off-the-record exchange, that we were encouraged to instead try it with remote technology.”

The summit’s original theme was “Economic Rejuvenation: Safely Bringing Corporations and Communities out of COVID Caves.” Organizers had prepared an agenda of discussion revolving around economic recovery, community rebuilding, biotech developments and U.S./China trade issues related to the COVID-19 crisis and breakdowns in diplomacy. But after Floyd’s death and the protests that followed, Sonnenfeld said, it was clear that a change in focus was needed.

“I worried about a ‘bait and switch’ charge with such a powerful, busy collection of leaders,” said Sonnenfeld “But they, too, are experiencing a sudden new priority and thankfully embraced the shift.”

Some of the opinion leaders and experts in attendance included 47th U.S. Vice President Joe Biden; Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont; U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer; Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit; 25th U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter; the 65th U.S. secretary of state, General Colin Powell; and former U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.

“This was a rare opportunity to have a cross-section of leaders, spanning industries, ideologies, and sectors, speak to the vital issues of the day,” said Sonnenfeld.

Summit attendees said they found the discussion deeply meaningful and helpful as they guide their organizations through turbulent times. Kay Koplovitz, the founder and former CEO of USA Network, called the meetings she attended Wednesday “extraordinary.” She added, “The challenges at hand were so well articulated by the mayors, regardless of political affiliation... same could be said for the CEO session.”

Tamara L. Lundgren, Chairman and CEO, Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc., wrote in a note to Sonnenfeld, “Both the mayors’ meeting and the CEO Summit were terrific and the topics discussed extraordinarily timely. Thank you for your leadership, deft touch, and ability to engage hundreds of people in a conversation and yet make it feel like a gathering of only a few.”

Nicole Russo, CEO and President of Microboard, commented that she believed the discussion at the event could help all the participants have meaningful impact in coming days. “I am committed personally and professionally to help drive the change our country needs. I look forward to staying in close contact with you and fellow CEOs on how we can collaborate to stabilize and propel our neighbors, businesses, and this great country to new heights.”

Among the cities represented by the mayors present were Lincoln, Nebraska; Atlanta, Georgia; Buffalo, New York; Louisville, Kentucky; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Hartford, Connecticut; Oakland, California; Miami, Florida; Tampa, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Stamford, Connecticut; and El Paso, Texas.||2
2020-06-05||SAN FRANCISCO, June 4, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The first class action lawsuit was filed today on behalf of the more than 2,800 passengers negligently exposed to COVID-19 on the Princess Cruise Lines Grand Princess cruise from San Francisco to Mexico from February 11, 2020 through February 21, 2020. The law firms Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, LLP, Mary Alexander & Associates, and Nelson & Fraenkel, LLP filed the suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.

The complaint alleges that at least 100 passengers who traveled onboard the Grand Princess Mexico trip have tested positive for COVID-19, and two died after disembarking. One of these fatalities was, at the time, the first-reported death caused by COVID-19 in California. All told, Carnival cruises have reportedly been associated with more than 1,500 positive COVID-19 infections and nearly 40 deaths.

"Carnival and Princess allowed potentially infected individuals on the Mexico cruise to share confined space with other passengers, casually and callously exposing all 2,500 passengers to serious illness from COVID-19," said Lieff Cabraser partner Elizabeth Cabraser, who filed the lawsuit on behalf of the Plaintiffs.

As detailed in the complaint, before the Mexico cruise, Carnival and Princess became aware of an outbreak of COVID-19 aboard another of their cruise ships, the Diamond Princess, during cruises in Asia. Ten cases were originally diagnosed, and that number rapidly escalated to over 700 cases—over one-fifth of the passengers onboard—with 14 deaths.

On February 11, 2020, approximately ten days after Carnival and Princess learned about the infections aboard the Diamond Princess, the defendants boarded plaintiffs and approximately 2,500 other passengers onto the Grand Princess for a roundtrip voyage to Mexico without conducting any effective medical screenings for passengers and without providing any additional information about best practices to mitigate or prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The complaint alleges that on or around February 19, 2020, Carnival and Princess became aware of at least one passenger suffering from COVID-19 symptoms onboard the Grand Princess Mexico cruise, but they did not warn passengers aboard the ship, nor did they put into place any quarantine requirements, social distancing protocols, or meaningfully alter their on-ship protocols, event itineraries, or cleaning and disinfectant practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19. As alleged in the complaint, after Carnival and Princess became aware of the first case aboard the ship, they worked to "keep the fun going" by "encouraging [guests] to mingle."

While onboard the Grand Princess, Plaintiff Dwight Everett began to experience symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and chose to self-isolate in his cabin. After disembarking from the cruise and returning to his home, Mr. Everett tested positive for COVID-19. Plaintiff Connie Simmons also became extremely ill while aboard the cruise, and suffered from a fever. She contacted medical staff on the ship, but did not receive any response for three days. When a doctor finally visited her room, the doctor refused to enter.

"We are shocked and disappointed that Carnival and Princess endangered our family," said Plaintiff James Simmons, who traveled aboard the Grand Princess with his family, including his mother, Connie Simmons. "We have been loyal customers for years and never imagined that Carnival and Princess would so carelessly put our health at risk."

"Multiple passengers on the Grand Princess's Mexico trip suffered from COVID-19 symptoms while on the vessel," noted Mary Alexander, who also represents the plaintiffs in the case, "exposing other passengers and crew members trapped on board the ship to the virus. This is categorically unacceptable."

The lawsuit sets forth claims of negligence, gross negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and seeks injunctive as well as compensatory damages, including the implementation by Carnival and Princess of new and meaningful appropriate social distancing and communicable disease communication and disinfection protocols upon all cruise ships, as well as ongoing medical monitoring, diagnostics, and treatment for all infected class members.

2020-06-05||I awake Saturday morning. Awaiting me is a team text from Shana about IG. I lie there, lamenting my lack of sleep. I rub my Quarantine Food Baby and think about Danielle’s upcoming postpartum post. I speak with Shana about said IG post. I check the news again, to see if the situation in America’s cities has gotten worse overnight. I do not want to face the day. I do not want to face my guilt or my sadness. It is all too heavy. I try to think about how we’ll get outside today (we’ve committed to going outside five days out of seven during quarantine) — without putting ourselves in potential danger of a protest that could potentially get out of hand. You can imagine how selfish this feels.

I move to the living room for my morning yoga. I watch the line of the cars on the highway. I know in my gut these cars are coming to Center City to attend the protest I am going to skip. I begin to think about my response. I watch as the city’s police force, in their cars with their bicycles attached, head into Center City to get into place for the protest I have decided we are not attending.

I had struggled through a day of “wrong responses” on Friday. First, Mr. Trump’s inflammatory response to the nation’s protests (the looting and shooting one). “Wrong response,” I thought. Then I listened, appalled, as columnist David Brooks gave another “wrong response” when Brian Lehrer asked him to put the President’s tweet into the context of his previous days’ column “If We Had A Real Leader”. Instead of condemning the president’s call for violence against protestors and looters, Brooks buried the idea in a lament about us living under the barrage of Mr. Trump’s Twitt-ocracy over the past three years. He said maybe it’s a complicated response, because he doesn’t condone rioting. He — clearly — could not bring himself to condemn the president’s call for violence. This seemingly insignificant moment overshadowed — and dare I say ignited — my mood of overwhelming sadness for an entire weekend. This glaringly incorrect response to a people’s suffering and its leader’s failure.

During our team catch-up Friday, when prompted by Syd, Shana said she would write her weekend post about “something light.” She said she has just written about Ahmaud Arbery’s death and that nothing changes. Disappointing response, I thought.

I had an afternoon check-in with A. I was sad. I needed to regroup. We re-grouped. We spoke of Woke Sadness. Maybe we’d do a Facebook Live for TME on Woke Sadness. S checked in. She’d written a post. She had sat down and gotten angry and written. I love when S does that.

As I do yoga, my mind is cinematic. I had scrolled through the AP and NY Times apps the night before, as I have done nightly since we’ve been in quarantine, and looked at all the pictures of chaos coming out of America’s cities. I do not have a TV for this reason. My mind is visual enough. Living in a pandemic has given any obsessive or compulsive anxieties new life. My amygdala is already working overtime.

I watch my mind as I do yoga. It explores my own response — or lack thereof.

Is it the images — the ones my mind is stuck on — of people — officers and protestors, their faces within inches of each other — yelling, my mind translating this as a transmission of COVID-19 — that is keeping me from protesting today?

I mean…anyone who has been hospitalized as a COVID-19 patient, and had no test or inconclusive test results, has no interest in being hospitalized for COVID-19, and therefore, quite frankly, no interest in being near other people.

The nonchalance of Derek Chauvin, smug and calm, spread around social media…I don’t need to watch the video. I finally learned that in 2016, after years of traumatizing myself by doing so every summer (Michael Brown, Freddie Gray, Philando Castille). Of course, it took someone else to point out that people of color viewing so much violence against other people of color can be traumatizing. It is.

Perhaps it is because I am no longer an expat? I attended plenty of protests in 2016 and 2017 with Goose in tow — from Standing Rock to the Women’s March and the Healthcare March — and even in 2018. Even though I returned to the U.S. in 2014, I still considered myself an expat for a number of years. As an expat, I had power. I had power, because for the six years I lived overseas, I got to be an American. Just an American. Nationality, ethnicity, religion…yes, I had to answer some of those questions and check those boxes—but for both nationality and ethnicity, I could simply write U.S.A or North American. I didn’t have to go through the mental minefield and jungle of arguments to determine whether to choose “Black,” “African-American”, Native American”, “White”, “Multiracial,” “Other,” … “Should I choose one, or check all that mathematically apply? America’s history is complex. Being African-American is complex.” “Is there a benefit to one over the other on this particular form?” “Will it work against me to declare my “race”? “Why are they asking for a race? Race is a social construct and we should stop giving it power.” So by the time I returned to the U.S., I felt human. I felt strong and independent and socio-economically invincible…even if I was broke.

I’ve done this before!! I’ve grabbed my bike, strapped my 4- then 5-year-old daughter in for protests so she could learn social justice the way other young warriors have. I was not worried back then – Obama too, had made me American with his notion of a shared narrative.

Philly for 20 years has successfully and peacefully protested, and I have experienced that. Granted, I learned to get there on time and leave when it was officially over (usually because it was a weeknight, and we had to have dinner and get ready for bed), but I showed up. I showed up — and with Goose.

Of course my fears — because that’s what they are, anxiety running amok in the midst of America’s Crisis of Violence in the midst of a Global Pandemic — are not about The Protest. And my reasons for staying home are not about not wanting to protest.

My fears? Are of a police system on steroids.

The militarization of American police departments — if you remember that exploration in 2014 after the riots in Ferguson — is one of the greatest fears I live with. It has only become amplified since I have given birth and reluctantly returned with my daughter to a country that has taken the bodies of Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland, Michael Brown, Alton Sterling, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Philando Castile, Atatiana Jefferson, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and many more.

I have no fear of a protest or protestors or even of rioters or looters. I have no fear of my fellow citizens (except maybe some of the gun-toting ones). I can get myself in and out of a dangerous situation — all the more easier when my daughter was in the seat on my bicycle than if, like now, she’d have to be on her own, us unconnected. It is an inappropriate police response that paralyzes me, imprisons me in my own home — and in my head.

A, K and I check in over text. K expresses her desire to head to the protest. I express my guilt over my lack of will. I feel ashamed of my response — or lack of response.

Unfortunately, the stream of police cars with the bicycles attached (that I associate with peaceful protests) morph throughout the day into a traumatizing montage of invisible — but not silent — unrest — in a very disturbing way.

I try to go about my day — Monday is looming and the housework and home admin must get done. But what does Monday even mean right now? What does work even look like on Monday? I sit at my desk to start the grocery order. I move to the kitchen to cook. I start moving plants to the balcony that have been waiting to be planted for months. I lay out a “magic screen” to hang on the balcony door. I tell Goose to get ready because we are going outside soon. I do all of this over and over and over again, in circles, unable to quiet the monologue in my head. Mid-afternoon, I see there is no traffic on the highway — 676, aka the Vine Expressway — which runs through the city. This is not a good sign.

The expressway is eye-level with our apartment.

We look. The police have blocked the highway. And then it begins. The activity that will continue throughout the weekend — that continues until now. Caravans of police — police vans, paddy wagons, state trooper SUVs — with their sirens back and forth across the expressway. Helicopters above us. The police car that is blocking the off-ramp angled just so, so that it is facing us. It is clear we are not going to go outside today, that I am not going to prove to myself that I am not afraid. I anxiously check my phone for news updates. Last time I had looked, the scheduled protests of the day had been peaceful; the first even socially distant. It is time to pot the plants.

We go to the balcony. In front of the police, with helicopters whirring above us, my stomach churning, Goose starts planting the herb garden my mother sent her for Easter; I am propagating plants.

How can I sit here potting plants? I am a coward.

I am planting new life, new life in honor of George Floyd. I feel calm for 30 seconds…or the length of that thought.

I am — if that officer is white, if that officer is prejudiced — defying a stereotype. I am planting plants with my daughter on a “nice” Saturday afternoon.

It is a good thing we did not go on the roof of the parking lot to jump rope. Are those police helicopters or news choppers? What if we had gone to the roof, and they mistook our jumping rope for aggressive behavior or got confused and thought we had weapons?

You are being a good parent for staying home. You could have gone to the City Hall protest and things would have been fine, and you would be continuing to model for your daughter social justice, like you used to. You would be doing what countless others are doing, and risking your life, because at this point, for us, it’s eithe||1
2020-06-05||DIRE HEADLINES had already been prepared before the release of America’s May jobs report on June 5th. Most analysts expected payroll employment to have fallen last month by several million, on the heels of record declines in March and April, and the unemployment rate to have jumped to nearly 20%. Instead, the Bureau of Labour Statistics reported a sharp increase in employment, of 2.5m, and a drop in the jobless rate from 14.7%, a post-Depression record, to 13.3%. Although the American labour market remains deeply troubled, President Donald Trump nonetheless convened a hastily called press conference to hail the news and declare the country back on the road to better days. “This is better than a V[-shaped recovery],” he said. “This is a rocket ship!”

Those bleak expectations had been set by a flow of dreadful economic news. Americans continue to file new claims for unemployment benefits by the million. Indices of economic activity showed that production kept declining across the economy in May, although at a far slower pace than in April. Yet some high-frequency indicators—such as restaurant bookings and measures of personal travel—had indicated signs of revival. And investors have been bullish for weeks, pushing stock indices close to new highs. They greeted the jobs data by sending the S&P 500 up by 2.6%.

But the details of the report, though encouraging, do not suggest that a rapid return to normality is imminent. New hiring was concentrated in service industries, primarily in health, leisure and hospitality. But the number of new jobs in May amounted to just a fraction of the total lost since February; the leisure industry added about 1.2m last month, but shed more than 8m in March and April. Part of the rebound in hiring can probably be explained by the structure of a federal aid programme intended to support small and medium businesses, which provides emergency loans that will ultimately be forgiven if lay-offs are avoided. Some of it, too, can be explained by initial steps towards reopening, as firms that were temporarily shut restarted work at dramatically reduced capacity. But although the number of Americans on temporary furlough declined, permanent lay-offs rose by nearly 300,000, taking the total to 2.3m. Disconcertingly, given the protests against police violence wracking the country, the jobless rate for black Americans ticked upwards, to 16.8%, while that for whites fell.

Labour-market data are very likely to keep improving over the summer, as state and local governments continue to ease lockdowns. The critical question for the American economy, however, is how many job losses and firm closures will prove permanent. Joblessness will probably remain well above normal levels, and policy support for the unemployed will continue to be justified. There are signs, however, that this surprising gust of good news may be undercutting interest in more spending in Washington. Meanwhile, the risk of new economic disruption, by covid-19 or by civil unrest, remains. The jobs figures were indeed a pleasant surprise. But it will be months, or years, until American workers can exhale without fear.||1
2020-06-05||In late May, CanSino Biologics published the first data for its COVID-19 vaccine expressing spike protein. The vaccine generated neutralizing antibodies in many recipients and appeared safe, but the company, like others in this space, remains on alert for a dangerous phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). “It’s important to talk about it [ADE],” says Gregory Glenn, president of R&D at Novavax, which launched its COVID-19 vaccine trial in May. But “we can’t be overly cautious. People are dying. So we need to be aggressive here.”

There are mounting theoretical concerns that vaccines generating antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may bind to the virus without neutralizing it. Should this happen, the non-neutralizing antibodies could enhance viral entry into cells and viral replication and end up worsening infection instead of offering protection, through the poorly understood phenomenon of ADE. ADE “is a genuine concern,” says virologist Kevin Gilligan, a senior consultant with Biologics Consulting, who advises thorough safety studies. “Because if the gun is jumped, and a vaccine is widely distributed that is disease enhancing, that would be worse than actually not doing any vaccination at all.”

The degree of ADE vaccine risk for SARS-CoV-2 is unknown.

“Most experts who look at it acknowledge the potential risk but don’t see compelling evidence for it in humans right now,” says James Crowe, director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Center. Some view coronavirus ADE as a laboratory phenomenon, at least so far. “The theoretical possibility [of ADE] is there,” says Rafi Ahmed, director of the Emory Vaccine Center. “The more difficult question becomes, how do you balance this concern with moving forward? There’s not an easy answer.”

ADE was first described in 1977 by virologist Scott Halstead, then at the University of Hawaii. Halstead studied dengue, caused by four related but antigenically distinct viruses known as ‘serotypes’. Halstead noted that animals previously infected with one serotype did worse if infected again with a different serotype than if never previously infected at all. He found antibodies to be responsible for this phenomenon. Instead of neutralizing the virus, the antibodies facilitated viral entry into host cells in vitro. In his publication, Halstead presciently wrote: “Non-neutralising antibody presumably provides a specific molecular ‘ride’ for an infectious dengue virion into the interior of a receptive phagocytic cell.”

Halstead’s speculation was later proven correct, not just for dengue, a flavivirus, but for other viruses, including coronaviruses, in cell culture experiments. The coronavirus uses its spike protein to bind host receptors and infect airway cells. But it also can infect immune cells, typically macrophages. Anti-spike antibodies ideally bind and neutralize the virus, either by blocking spike binding to its receptor or by preventing fusion of the virus with the cell. But if antibodies fail to do this because they bind unproductively to the virus, these non-neutralizing antibodies may instead, using the Fc region at the base of the antibody, latch onto host macrophage Fc receptors and ferry the virus into these host cells, at least in vitro. Once inside, the viruses replicate and then exit to further spread infection to neighboring cells and tissues.

Poor-quality antibodies that bind the virus without neutralizing it are one reason vaccine candidates fail, and, in theory, could also cause ADE, delivering virions to host cells.

Can SARS-CoV-2 infect macrophages? “I don’t know,” answers Stan Perlman, a coronavirus expert at the University of Iowa. “Those data are not out there yet.” The virus can infect macrophages in vitro, but that doesn’t necessarily translate to in vivo human biology. “In tissue culture cells you can make almost any virus show this, by jigging the right cells, the right amount of antibody, and the right virus. But that [is] not really meaningful, because of the fact that it’s so artificial.”

The risk that a COVID-19 vaccine will cause ADE and facilitate infection “is completely theoretical,” says Novavax’s Glenn. “It’s a lab, an animal phenomenon that’s been observed. [But] in RSV it’s a real clinical event.” In a 1960s vaccine trial, 80% of infants and young children immunized against RSV (respiratory syncytial virus, an RNA virus in the family Paramyxoviridae) ended up hospitalized, and 2 children died. Only 5% of the children in the control group required hospitalization. Vaccinated children carried high titers of non-neutralizing antibodies, implicating ADE in the tragic outcome, although a T 2 (inflammatory) T cell response also probably contributed.

Since then, some vaccine studies in animals, as well as human trials where vaccinated people had worse outcomes, suggest ADE at work. But definitive evidence is lacking. “We can’t say they were not due to ADE, but there’s not evidence that they were,” says Ahmed. “There are many other ways that an immune response can cause damage.”

For coronavirus vaccines, the ADE story is similarly inconclusive. Cats vaccinated with spike protein against feline coronavirus died much faster than unvaccinated cats and carried more anti-spike antibodies, implicating ADE. But macaques vaccinated against SARS-CoV-1 did not show enhanced infection or disease.

In humans, limited data for vaccines against earlier coronaviruses did not show ADE. Two vaccines against the closely related SARS-CoV-1 appeared safe in early trials. A DNA vaccine against the MERS coronavirus in macaques protected all eight monkeys from infection symptoms, and that MERS vaccine was well-tolerated in a 2016 phase 1 human trial. MERS vaccine co-developer David Weiner, director of the Vaccine & Immunotherapy Center at the Wistar Institute, co-developed a very similar COVID-19 vaccine that Inovio Pharmaceuticals took into human trials in early April.

“We don’t see it [ADE] with flu, we don’t see it with so many other vaccines that we have,” says Ahmed. “We shouldn’t dismiss it completely, but then if you look at the broader world of vaccinology, this has not been seen.” But Gilligan says some earlier SARS and MERS vaccine candidates didn’t advance because of signs of ADE.

ADE is a concern for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) too, at least in theory, because mAbs that fail to neutralize the virus also could facilitate viral entry into cells. Many companies are working on such mAbs for either COVID-19 prevention or therapy. AstraZeneca, for example, is partnering with Vanderbilt, which has identified, expressed and evaluated virus-neutralizing antibodies from B cells recovered from convalescents. AstraZeneca will take the best ones forward into clinical trials.

ADE is part of the mAb discussion. “There’s not a lot of obvious epidemiologic evidence for it yet,” says Vanderbilt’s Crowe. Nevertheless, he says, “we will address this.” Crowe’s group will test for ADE by seeing whether its monoclonal antibodies can deliver viruses into macrophages, compared with antibodies whose Fc region has been inactivated. (An antibody lacking Fc can’t bind macrophage Fc receptors and thus can’t cause ADE. That’s why some companies are advancing mAbs with the Fc region knocked out.) Still, “the animal models are so inadequate right now, it would be very difficult to prove whether [ADE] is common or uncommon,” Crowe says.

For mAbs, the risk is probably low. “You’re already characterizing it as a highly neutralizing antibody,” says Ahmed. Convalescent antibody passive immunization trials, now underway, could carry some ADE risk, Ahmed says. “[But] I would be less concerned with that than with the vaccine that might be inducing suboptimal response.”

Vaccine companies are fully aware of ADE. “All the groups have been discussing this, everyone’s on the same page, everyone wants a safe [COVID-19] vaccine,” says Weiner. Inovio went forward into the clinic after showing safety in primates, and is reassured by the strong human safety record of its MERS vaccine. But vaccine trials are being approved “without the usual amount of preclinical safety/tox data available for guidance,” says Gilligan.

Given the urgency, the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency may have little choice but to give the go ahead to enter the clinic. Novavax launched a phase 1/2 trial of its vaccine, a stable prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimer nanoparticle vaccine with a saponin-based adjuvant, in late May. The company is experienced with viral vaccines: its nanoparticle flu vaccine recently met its phase 3 endpoints. The SARS-CoV-2 virus “is not new territory,” Glenn says, adding that Novavax and other vaccine companies can assay for whether antibodies can block spike protein–receptor binding, or neutralize the virus, or both, which should prevent infection.

And ADE? “One has to address it,” Glenn says, but he points out that ADE is only a theoretical COVID-19 vaccine risk. “It’s hypothesized from animal studies,” he says. “I think the way forward is to take it seriously, do some animal studies, show you don’t have enhancement, monitor during the trial. My view is, we can’t let this issue keep us from getting to a vaccine that will save millions of lives.”

But Anne De Groot, CEO of EpiVax, argues for a more nuanced approach. EpiVax develops T-cell-directed vaccines, using computational tools to select viral T cell epitopes. The company found SARS-CoV-2 sequences that would appear human to T cell receptors.

This could be a problem for any vaccine. “The T cells either don’t respond as strongly, because they think that the [coronavirus] spike is human, or that sequence can trigger a regulatory T cell response,” says De Groot. Such T cells can interfere with beneficial antibody production and “you don’t get neutralizing antibodies, you get the kind of antibodies that actually potentially enhance infection.” In other words, ADE.

2020-06-06||The late management guru Peter Drucker who presciently advocated “back room” outsourcing and corporate decentralisation at a time when these smart cost-saving techniques were anathema to produce-everything-hire-everyone mega corporations, had a few more tricks up his sleeve.

One of his key mantras – price-led costing – often overlooked even today yet something profoundly relevant to all businesses, especially those connected with travel, is worth re-examining in a dysfunctional Covid-19 world.

The central argument is simple. Most companies tend to create a product they feel the market wants and outspend each other to produce it, subsequently passing on the entire cost to consumers with a further profit slab packed with humungous CEO salaries on top of all this extravagance. This is cost-driven pricing and is typical of the sort of big ego branding popular today.

Druker’s answer to this was blindingly simple. Check the price your audience might be willing to pay for a product and then keep production costs and profit margins within this budget. This is price-led costing. It is as relevant for airline seats as for luxury hotels.

Of course price-led costing (for any desirable good) is entirely predicated on scarcity, which drives price. One of the problems monster brands like Louis Vuitton faced in Asia was the sort of over exposure that instantly drove down perceived value often with perverse results. At one point Hongkongers shunned LV-monogrammed travel bags due to their mass popularity with Macau casino bumpkins.

As airlines posit scenarios in a Covid-19 or post-virus world it seems an inescapable truth that passengers will need to be distanced and isolated somehow to allay fears of contagion. With previous models entirely based on the sardine concept of spacing, packing in seats, and eliminating window exits to cram in more bodies, this is jarringly revolutionary.

Aircraft design will move towards more protected personal space with wraparound headrest partitions, novel seating configurations and, perhaps, access to cargo areas reconverted into gyms or wellness escapes. Family cabins may arrive in economy, modelled after the innovative Qsuites on Qatar Airways that can turn into quads for foursomes.

Fewer seats will invariably mean higher ticket prices. Will air passengers accept this additional burden on groaning wallets? Or might they consider it a worthwhile investment in emotional security or a sought after ‘luxury’ perk? In other words might travel once again become something expensive, rare, and unattainable, thereby bestowing upon it the original cachet of a romantic treat as in the days of the magnificent Pan Am Clipper flying boats?

Travellers will increasingly see luxury hotels as safe havens with trustworthy corporate protocols unlike the unregulated bottom-feeder Airbnb offerings, now fraught with unknown dangers. Private villa escapes will come to epitomise less is more, a phrase hitherto spouted by many but believed by few. Huge cookie-cutter fairy-lights hotels will not disappear as there is always space for mid-range products but, in a Covid world, there can be no scrimping on safety and this in turn will push prices up factoring in guest spacing, staff training, enhanced hygiene, lavish wellness partnerships and thermal-scanning equipment.

But regardless of whether price inches up or down, business models must be thoroughly reviewed and reset. Dropping oil prices (though this may be short term) and the Covid reality offer a huge opportunity for a travel rethink. It is time to abandon the sloppy cost-led pricing that has dominated monster travel projects, based on the assumption of ever-increasing hordes of cash-rich Chinese consumers. That is now a mirage as travel for the near term turns inward with a focus on domestic transactions and ‘safe corridors’ (pairing cities or countries) whether in China, USA, India, Thailand, or Indonesia.

Price-led costing will be the key, whether aiming for the luxury traveller or the less financially frivolous. It is a sound argument for any time and a good one to take onboard as globalism goes through a major adjustment in the face of mounting ultranationalist sentiment – with some manufacturing and business travel returning home over time.

Travellers willing to spend for a romantic break from the quotidian grind will make very careful choices and demand a lot more value. They will be in the driver’s seat now. Luxury travellers will not simply swarm marbled lobbies demanding free Bellinis. They will get tough.

Travellers looking for value will be equally demanding. Gone are the days when a guesthouse could say, ‘You get what you pay for.’ Safety cuts both ways. Hotels and airlines will need protocols to ensure their clientele is potentially okay just as travellers will examine holiday escapes in minute detail, perhaps preferring less trampled out-of-the-way places like the Maldives where privacy is ensured and social contact minimised.

Business travellers cautiously venturing out may be the hardest hit as this is the segment where the travel sector will try and make up for the loss. It would do well to remember though that with work-from-home and video conferencing much the rage, there is no inelastic demand anymore. Too much of a fare hike will dull corporate enthusiasm. Travel is already a significant cost for companies and medical-travel-labour insurance premiums will soar in a Covid world.

For a start, travel will stay close to home (and close to medical fallbacks) and we will become like kids learning to walk, picking up the courage to foray farther each day. But like that infernal coronavirus, travel is in the blood. We’ll find out which wins out. In the meanwhile, the travel industry can restore itself by stepping away from the mirage and incorporating sound pricing practices.

2020-06-06||On April 30, the Government fast-tracked new legislation to introduce further tax changes in response to the impacts of the Covid-19 outbreak.

The key tax component of the Covid-19 Response (Taxation and Other Regulatory Urgent Matters) Act 2020 is a temporary tax loss carry-back measure.

Broadly, this allows businesses that anticipate being in a loss for the 2020 or 2021 tax years, to carry some or all of the loss back to the preceding year to enable an immediate cash refund of prior tax paid.

To be eligible, a taxpayer must have made or anticipate they will make a loss in either of the 2020 or 2021 tax years. The taxpayer must have a profit in the year prior to the loss year. This means:

* Losses from the 2020 year may be carried back to the 2019 year

* Losses from the 2021 year may be carried back to the 2020 year

Taxpayers can claim a tax refund for provisional tax paid by re-estimating 2020 provisional tax where the 2020 return is not yet filed, or by amending their 2019 tax return to factor in the loss carry back. The rules will apply to companies, trusts and individuals (other than those deriving only PAYE income) and those that operate through partnerships and look-through companies.

Overall, this is a very positive initiative, and one the Government should be commended for. However, because of its rushed implementation, it’s not perfect, not necessarily as straightforward as it seems and will not suit all businesses.

Each business will have different circumstances and each will need to consider whether this mechanism is the right option for them. Inland Revenue’s systems went live in early May with the changes so taxpayers can make elections to carry-back losses via the 'I want to' section of MyIR.

A few considerations and scenarios to reflect on are outlined below

Most business will be looking to use this mechanism in relation to a loss incurred in the 2021 year and carry this back to the 2020 income year which may still be profitable given Covid-19 may have only affected the last quarter of this year.

A business that needs cash urgently will want to elect to carry back its anticipated loss as soon as possible; however, a business will need to be fairly confident of the level of loss and think carefully about how the rest of the year will play out.

This is because, if a business over-estimates its 2021 loss which results in tax payable, use of money interest (UOMI) will apply from August 28, 2019 (for a March balance date taxpayer), which is the first instalment date of 2020 provisional tax. Further, it will not be possible to apply for relief from UOMI imposed under the remission rules recently enacted.

To minimise potential exposure to UOMI, the business might want to take a conservative position initially given we are only into the third month of the new tax year and re-estimate the loss later or as the year progresses.

However, holding off may not provide the much-needed cash now which could force some businesses to take some risks in this regard. Timing of electing, filing the return and monitoring losses will be key.

It will be possible to re-estimate the 2021 loss to carry back at any time prior to the earlier of the date the 2020 return is filed or the due date for filing.

The rules require the immediately preceding year to have taxable income. There will be some companies where the pattern of income and losses is such that the carry-back mechanism won’t be much, or any benefit.

For example, taxable income in the 2019 year might have been high under normal trading conditions and so 2020 provisional tax paid to date is based on residual income tax for this year.

Taxable income in the 2020 year (particularly if it is a late balance date) might have dropped, but may have only dropped to a lower taxable income and so it not yet a loss.

Even if there are large losses anticipated in 2021, these will only be able to be carried back to the extent of the lower taxable income in the immediately preceding year, which may not release that much tax paid.

Likewise, a company with a small loss in 2020 and a larger loss in 2021 will be constrained to only being able to use the smaller loss in 2020 to amend only the 2019 tax return, such that the company is unable to carry back the larger loss incurred in 2021.

Refunds might be limited or trapped

For taxpayers that are companies, any refunds will be limited to the credit balance in its company imputation credit account at the date of the most recently ended tax year (ie March 31, 2020, although some timing exceptions apply).

Therefore, if a company has been in the habit of paying most of its profits as dividends to shareholders and attaching imputation credits, it may find access to cash refunds is limited.

The policy rationale for this rule is that the company’s tax has been paid to shareholders already via imputation credits. Any trapped refunds may be applied to income or provisional tax liabilities, if any will exist.

If the company has traditionally paid out its profits for the year as shareholder salaries, the company won’t have any taxable income to carry future losses back to. The shareholders and not the company in this case have paid the provisional tax.

Therefore, an option might be for the shareholders to estimate 2020 provisional tax to nil and have the company elect to not pay any shareholder salaries for the 2020 tax year if losses are forecast for 2021 if this is possible.

However, this could then expose the company to an FBT liability if there are outstanding current accounts, so care is required. Other options may be feasible in this scenario.

The important point to note is that companies will need to do some work and determine what the approach to paying shareholder salaries should be in light of these rules.

The new Act contains an anti-avoidance measure, which could apply if shares in any company have been subject to an arrangement so that a loss company falls into the rules if the purpose of the arrangement is to defeat the intention of the rules.

It is possible any cute “tax planning” of this nature to deliberately take advantage of the rules would be scrutinised down the track.

We acknowledge the Government has brought these rules in under urgency to provide assistance for businesses in need of cash flow.

It has endeavoured to strike a balance of giving the much-needed assistance, accommodating the need for part year and grouping rules, while still maintaining some integrity measures. Unfortunately doing all these things inevitably leads to complex legislation.

The decision to use this mechanism will be heavily fact dependent on each business’s circumstances. There are policy design features that mean the rules will not be that useful to some of the SME businesses targeted.

It is clear it will not be the panacea for every business and could in some cases expose a taxpayer to significant UOMI or other taxes unless care is taken.

2020-06-06||We are all Keynesians now with governments around the world shovelling cash into their economies to try to at least partially offset the economic damage of lockdowns. Even uber-prudent Germany has engaged in an extraordinary spending spree, first to support businesses during the closure period and then this week announcing big VAT cuts, a €300 family bonus for every child and another round of business supports.

Ireland’s Achilles’ heel in the past is that the government has spent when we had the money and then been forced to cut back in times of recession. Boom and bust cycles resulted. This time around, having entered the pandemic in reasonable economic shape and with the budget in surplus, we have some leeway. Ireland is engaged in a big fiscal stimulus,with government spending in the first five months of the year up by more than 20 per cent . Fortunately the State can still borrow money at negligible interest rates to fund the deficit that is opening up, thanks in part to unprecedented intervention from the European Central Bank.

So can the next government float into office on a wave of borrowed cash which it can dispense? Not really. A careful reading of the recent report from the budget watchdog, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, shows that each stage of the crisis will bring its own challenges – and that we simply can’t budget on the basis of being able to borrow at current interest rates forever. We are walking a shaky financial tightrope as we move through this.

The hard calls start on day one for the next government. Yes, ministers will have the cheque book out – but the queue at the hatch will be long and not everyone will get paid. You could argue about just how high the deficit could be this year – and the answer might well end up north of 10 per cent of gross domestic product – but there is a limit.

As well as the contentious issue of the phasing-out of wage and income supports, there are calls from business for more cash, a line-up of State bodies with big financial holes and so on. There is a strong case to go the extra mile on the once-off supports – and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe hinted on Friday that more help to protect businesses and jobs would likely be needed. But deciding what will be subsidised through the crisis and what won’t will be hugely controversial.

And as well as once-off costs, the need to provide ongoing higher levels of spending – in health, childcare, education, public transport and so on – provides a big budgetary challenge. Donohoe referred this week to the likely need to continue borrowing in the years ahead to fund higher spending levels.

The programme for government, if agreed, and the subsequent national recovery programme may give some context to this and to how the public finances might evolve. Right now we need it . The “A” word is being thrown around in relation to every proposed reduction of an emergency support programme, and every refusal to throw additional cash at some other problem.

What we are facing is not austerity – which is when a government hikes taxes and cuts spending to reduce the budget deficit during a recession. That is what happened in 2009 and 2010. Now government borrowing is soaring. The issue is making decisions on where the money goes to and how much we can spend – all against a backdrop of huge uncertainty. Pretending there is some endless supply of cash and no constraint at all on borrowing into the future is just not credible.

Choices will also await in what the IFAC called phase two, which is when the Government goes to stimulate the economy via higher spending, probably moving into 2021 if the opening-up goes okay. The council pencilled in €10 billion as a possible stimulus, though said it should be “temporary and targeted”. Again, you can just imagine the queue of mendicants for this . The money will only go so far and only last so long – and continued restrictions in areas like tourism might leave some sectors unable to benefit .

The council’s central expectation is that the economy might return to its pre-Covid position in a couple of years. That would be a result. With the economy growing, there would then be a job in adjusting tax and spending over a period of years to get the public finances back on a sustainable path. The council guesstimated that this might involve tax hikes and spending cuts of €6 billion to €14 billion, probably starting in 2023. But it should be possible to avoid another bout of severe austerity.

New government programmes, separate from the pandemic, will have to be paid for too and any credible programme for government must face the trade-offs. Not increasing the pension age, for example, will leave less to spend elsewhere. Green policies are vital, but come with a price tag.

We are facing into unprecedented uncertainty – we really don’t have any basis to decide how the next few months will go. The IFAC analysis shows just how delicate the outlook is and how a worse health outcome could cause real challenges

Economics is all about the allocation of scarce resources. And politics, over the next few years, will be too, and the uncertainties make this a lot more difficult. The ECB made clear this week that its programme to support the market would last until at least June of next year – and longer if needed. But it said, too, that it is a temporary intervention. And it would not be clever to assume current borrowing costs will continue for Ireland on the market once the ECB starts to wind down. The era of money for (almost) nothing won’t last forever. When it ends, we can’t afford to get caught out again, as we did in the last crisis.||1
2020-06-06||A walk in the park? Just sign here...

Visitors to national parks must now make reservations before entering, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment says.

Parks are expected to be opened before the end of the month but visitors who usually can just walk in, must now register.

"Online reservations will be required for health reasons," Environment Minister Varawut Silpa-archa said.

The government's Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) is expected to lift many remaining lockdown measures next Friday.

All Covid-19 vulnerable sites including concert events, pubs and karaoke shops, massage parlours, amusement parks and national parks are expected to be reopened.

Mr Varawut said the same restrictions need to be in place at parks to help visitors to follow social distancing policies.

"By next week, we are going to have an announcement of what visitors should do and should not do while visiting the parks," he said.

"One of the certain measures is that visitors must make a reservation first. They cannot just walk in."

He said the Department of National Parks (DNP) will use a sophisticated reservation system to control the number of park visitors.

He said national parks have high visitor rates, citing the number of people at Doi Inthanon National Park in Chiang Mai province on 30 Dec 2018 as being recorded at 20,469, according to DNP figures.

Apart of introducing the reservation policy, the minister said the DNP must require visitors to check in via the "Thai Chana" mobile application.

"I understand that there will be problem at the early stage of implementation so we are going to have a hotline to provide help and information for those who are in need," he said.

He said the reservation and check-in system is likely to be implemented until the Covid-19 pandemic is under control.

However, Mr Varawut said the DNP will consider using both measures in the long run in a bid to keep the number of park visitors at an optimal level, so the ecological system will not be strained.

He said the two-month lockdown during the Covid-19 crisis has allowed time for ecology in national parks to recover. The ministry is also considering new land zoning plans for national parks. Each national park will have zoning regulations based on public accessibility.||0
2020-06-06||A south Dublin nursing home is closing because it is unable to meet its statutory and regulatory requirements to operate at full capacity or fund the costs needed to meet them.

St Mary’s Centre (Telford) on Merrion Road said the Covid-19 pandemic had no bearing on the decision to close and that the home, which has 35 residents, has remained free of the disease.

The care home said the “current and projected levels of funding from the HSE mean that the nursing home will not be able to meet the necessary statutory and regulatory requirements to operate at 100 per cent capacity” and that it was currently operating at 60 per cent capacity.

“This decision was reached by the board following a number of meetings and detailed reviews concerning the funding of the nursing home, the necessary implications for the viability of the nursing home and its capacity to meet statutory and regulatory requirements,” said the home.

St Mary’s said in a statement it could not recruit and retain staff needed “to provide the high standard of care of the residents to which the board aspires” or ensure full compliance with the requirements sought by State watchdog the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa).

The facility is located on a campus beside St Vincent’s hospital and is governed and run under the ethos of the Sisters of Charity.

“We have taken this extraordinarily difficult decision to wind down the operations of the nursing home in a careful and considered manner,” the home said.

“We have not been able to secure capital funding to address necessary infrastructure issues or revenue funding to meet current and anticipated operative costs so we have no alternative but to close.”

St Mary’s was the subject of a highly critical report in 2017 by Hiqa whose inspectors found it had failed to respond effectively to the needs of frail and highly dependent residents. A follow-up inspection by Hiqa in 2018 found that the home was still not complying with some regulations.

The home said the closure is being planned and organised over “the necessary period of time”, and that it intends to consult staff, residents and their families and keep in regular contact to ensure the transfers of residents happen “as smoothly as possible and with the minimum of disruption”.

Mervyn Taylor, executive director of Sage Advocacy, a support service for vulnerable adults, said the closure of St Mary’s was a concern. He called for further research to assess the strength of the nursing home sector to cope in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.

“We hope that this is not the start of a process of other closures and we think that some resilience study of the sector is required post-Covid to assess the level of risk in the event that more nursing homes, particularly smaller providers, want to get out of the market,” he said.||1
2020-06-06||CBC Calgary wants to hear from you. How are you finding the new normal of the COVID-19 pandemic? Have you gone for a haircut? Been to a restaurant? How will you spend your summer? Are you longing to get back to the office, or do you love working from home? Have you started a new hobby? Learned a new skill? Send us a page from your COVID-19 diary.

In this instalment of our series, Deary Diary: In a Time of COVID-19, Isabella Lopez Rivadeneira tells us about coding and building robots during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This entry has been edited for clarity and length.

My name is Isabella L.R, and this is my fourth year on the Maplebots robotics team. We are based in Calgary, Canada, and I have to say, they've been the best four years of my life.

Being a 12-year-old, a few days ago we competed in the Robotics People online competition. With the COVID-19 crisis, a competition didn't seem like the best thing to do. Robotics People put one on, though, very strategically.

They put on an online competition in which we participated in the section called Mini Sumo for the very first time. I've participated in A-Mazing and Line Following, even Fire Fighting, but Mini Sumo is new to me. New to all of us at Maplebots.

Traditionally, in sumo, two bots go head-to-head in a fight to push the other one out of the dojo, but since we all need social distance, Robotics People played with the challenge a bit.

In Mini Sumo, your robot has to push 16 cups out of a circular dojo. That's quite a clever thing since there can't be two robots. Being new to the challenge, we took it on. That's how my brother and I kept ourselves busy, coding and building our robot.

• Dear Diary: Calgary kids tell their pandemic stories through art

Since it was a new challenge, we used a familiar robot. Edison is a robot from Australia that uses the platforms Edblocks, EdPython and Edscratch.

I have to say, it was a new and difficult experience, many all-nighters and failures. But when competition day came, we were ready. We had three rounds, and the less time your robot spent getting the cups out, the more points you had.

All those nights awake were worth it when in one of our rounds we did it in 22 seconds. That was the best score. We won!

Edison was fast enough to push all 16 cups out of a 79-centimeter dojo in 22 seconds. It really was a pleasure to get our first win on Robotics People, plus my first time doing it online.

Now my goal is to be better. We're still getting better, you see, but it's a lot of fun, especially with new challenges. We're not done competing, though. No matter if COVID-19 stops us from doing so in person, we'll still compete.

So, Dear Diary, expect to hear more of us!

2020-06-06||Individual COVID-19 fatality risk (and the consequences for universities)

Reopening universities for the autumn term will be risky for individuals' health and safety. This column describes the latest epidemiological evidence and argues that the biggest influence on individuals’ risk of severe illness is age. Individuals in their sixties face a 30 times higher fatality risk from COVID-19 than individuals in their thirties. Being obese, non-white, a man, and having an underlying health condition also matter – each roughly doubles the fatality risk. But chronological age still remains the biggest risk – a fact that universities should keep in mind when planning their autumnal schedules.

Many European universities plan to re-open as physical spaces in the autumn of 2020. How much danger will that create? What is an individual’s risk of severe illness and death? How should university leaders take the health of their staff into account when planning for the next academic year (the economic issues were discussed recently in a VoxEU article by Peter Dolton)?

In our judgement, the most reliable source of information on the risk from COVID-19 is a 2020 “Open Safely” paper written by Elizabeth Williamson of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, with a large number of colleagues. It is a piece of technical epidemiological writing. We make an attempt to convey that paper’s substance in a way that we hope might be helpful to those enrolled and working in universities and the senior management teams who head them.

The first point to make is that the biggest influence on a person’s COVID-19 risk is age. The risk from age is actually an extraordinarily accelerating one (log-linear, as an approximation). There have been grumpy and inaccurate discussions of this issue of age and risk in UK newspapers where lobby groups attacked the idea that chronological age is what matters. Instead, the risk associated with so-called health conditions, with being a man, obese, non-white, or with having diabetes has been emphasized by the media.

Further, our two papers recommending a release out of the lockdown of the young have led to many older people reaching out to us voicing their beliefs that because they feel fit, they face little or no risk from COVID-19. Unfortunately, that belief is incorrect. Age is the crucial risk to bear in mind as shown by Williamson et al. (2020) (see Figure 1).

Figure 1 Deaths from COVID-19 in England and Wales since January 2020

Note: Number of deaths registered in England and Wales where COVID-19 was mentioned in the certificate – up to 15/05/2020

Examining anonymized health records of 17 million UK citizens, the authors assess who has died from COVID-19 while statistically adjusting for a large number of influences on people’s risk. Standard regression equations are then used to calculates hazard ratios. The results are the following:
• People between 50-60 face a fatality risk from COVID-19 that is approximately 14 times higher than the risk faced by those around the middle of the age band of 18-40.
• For individuals between 60-70 who are in good health, the risk is 30 times higher.
• The fatality risk of men is double that of women.
• Individuals with middle-aged spread, holding other things constant, face an about 50% higher risk.
• The same holds for non-white individuals as they face an almost doubled risk.
• Most standard kinds of health conditions also increase fatality risk, roughly 2 to 3 times, in general. The risk of individuals diagnosed with cancer is higher than the risk of men in general, but it is still lower than the risk of simply being old.

Hence, the most prominent risk indeed stems simply from age. In essence, this is due to young ‘animals’ stronger immune-response to most viruses also applying to COVID-19.

Some newspapers have confusingly run headlines proclaiming obesity as a major cause of COVID-19 deaths. However, while keeping ones BMI below 25 is certainly advisable and obese people undoubtedly face a higher risk of dying from COVID-19, the main reason why obese people are dying much more is because obese people tend to be older.

A second worrisome concern is the likelihood of misleading triumphalism in Europe over the coming summer. Premature optimism had lulled people already during the so-called Spanish Flu in the years of 1918-1919. Figure 2, taken from Taubenberger and Morens (2006), depicts the three waves of deaths from the Spanish Flu. The first wave, which at the time seemed very large, peaked in early summer of 1918. When it died down, policymakers took a more relaxed approach as they believed it to be over. Unfortunately, a second wave appeared in autumn of 1918 and the number of deaths this time was five times higher. A third wave followed in the Spring of 1919 but most deaths occurred in late autumn and winter just after the pandemic was believed to be over.

Figure 2 Deaths in the UK from the Spanish Flu 1918-1919

University presidents should keep this in mind when planning universities’ autumnal schedules. Our hunch is that misleading optimism about having beaten COVID-19 may appear by the end of the summer and lead to calls to open up UK universities in a really fundamental way. While it may be true that COVID-19 will really be over by then, it is also worryingly possible that we are in for some form of a re-run of 1918. As early hotspots for COVID-19 were places like meat packing plants and skiing resorts, which are both characterized by low temperatures, it is possible that the coronavirus microbe may prefer cold environments. Studying the Spanish Flu virus, He et al. (2013) conclude that every extra 10 degrees Celsius reduced the spread of this virus by nearly 50%. Of course, COVID-19 is a different virus which might behave differently and much is still to be learned about COVID-19.

A third concern is that the virus might mutate. However, there is not much that can be done about that except to hope for the best.

What should university faculty know and do?

First, faculty members might want to appreciate the fact that most students are young and hence face a rather miniscule risk - current estimates suggest that it may be about the same as the risk of dying in a UK road accident in a normal year. Second, university staff older than 50 may need to consider their own relative risk, and might prefer to avoid front-line contact with students until a vaccine is found. Third and more encouraging, current evidence suggests that even without a vaccine the great majority of Europe’s population will live through the pandemic without serious illness. Absolute risk for most people appears to be fairly low, and there even remains a slight chance that the virus will disappear more quickly than standard epidemiological modelling has predicted.

Still, there is a long and menacing path ahead of us for the coming autumn and winter, where it pays for each individual to know about their own relative risk. For university presidents and their management teams, it is essential to recognize that the COVID-19 virus is much more dangerous to older members of university staff. This time, age matters.

2020-06-06||Across two Cabinet meetings on Thursday and Friday, Ministers discussed and then gave the green light to an unexpectedly dramatic acceleration of the lifting of the coronavirus restrictions.

Some around Government had wondered why the Taoiseach had convened a meeting in Dublin Castle on Thursday night, the first time the full Cabinet had met face-to-face since the restrictions were introduced in March.

At the meeting, Leo Varadkar and Minister for Health Simon Harris asked the Ministers for their views on what should be accelerated, and a discussion followed.

Those present say that having everyone in a room face to face allowed for a more free-flowing debate than has been the norm during recent meetings held via video link.

Minister for Rural Affairs Michael Ring, one of the most vociferous in arguing that the lifting of the lockdown could be accelerated, argued that the limit on travel should be abolished completely rather than expanded from 5km to 20km from Monday.

The Cabinet decided that people should be allowed to travel either 20km from their homes or anywhere else within their county. It was one of two occasions where the Ministers deviated from the advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET); the other being the decision to allow shopping centres to reopen from June 15th.

Minister for Business Heather Humphreys, whose public profile and stock across Government has risen during the crisis, argued that retailers in shopping centres should not be at a disadvantage to those on the high street, whose reopening had been agreed by NPHET.

Recent weeks had seen arguments within Government, and outside, about how much Ministers should adhere to the advice of NPHET and chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan.

The discussion and decisions across the two Cabinet meetings this week gave Ministers buy-in, and a sense of ownership, to what was ultimately announced.

But if there was pressure applied to NPHET and Dr Holohan to accelerate the lifting of the lockdown, it is likely to have happened behind the scenes.

Varadkar and Harris insist that the politicians have worked alongside their medical advisers throughout this process and, at the post-Cabinet press conference on Friday, the Taoiseach acknowledged that there was a back and forth between Government and NPHET on the way forward.

He pointedly told the Dáil on Thursday that he had asked Dr Holohan and NPHET to examine if some elements of the lockdown exit plan could be accelerated – measures moved from phase three to two and phase four to three, for example.

Dr Holohan had told NPHET he had been thinking about how to merge the final phases together, and Government sources pointed out that the decision to cut the original plan down from five stages to four came from NPHET itself.

Sources said NPHET discussions this week included claims that a decision not to bring forward more phases could be regretted if a further lockdown had to be imposed in the event of a second Covid-19 wave.

After the acceleration was announced, those who argued that the Cabinet should take more control away from NPHET were satisfied. Those who said NPHET and Government Buildings moved in line with each other pointed to a correlation between Dr Holohan’s letter to Harris recommending to proceed to the next phase on Monday and the final Cabinet announcement.

Those who had argued that the plan should be speeded up to lift the economy, boost domestic tourism and reduce the number of people out of work believed it was their stance that had won out.||0
2020-06-06||On December 2019, the district of Wuhan in central China announced detection of a previously undescribed virus that led to clusters of pneumonia. The disease caused by this novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was subsequently named coronavirus disease 2019, the COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was declared as a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January and a pandemic on 11 March [1]. Despite lessons learnt from previous outbreaks, the preparedness and awareness for such a transmittable virus was inadequate to stop its spread of COVID-19 to over 4,700,000 patients with crude mortality of 6.6% as of May 19 2020 [2]. The mortality in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients remains high, and it is unclear if some of these patients may be rescued with ECMO.

There have been several viral outbreaks in recent memory, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic H1N1 influenza and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (Fig. 1). Whilst the SARS outbreak in China in 2002 [3] caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome through coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [4,5,6,7,8], there is minimal reported data on the use of ECMO. This was because ECMO was not commonly used at that time, even in those critically ill patients who did not respond favourably to conventional mechanical ventilation and other adjuncts [9]. There is some data on use of ECMO in MERS [10,11,12,13,14,15]. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic witnessed the rise of ECMO, and this in part can be attributed to the significant “age shift” with younger patients (< 65 years of age) getting more affected by the virus. Improvements in technology over time have certainly played a significant role too.

Since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, more evidence has emerged support venovenous (V-V) ECMO use in ARDS [16,17,18,19,20]. The use of venoarterial (V-A) ECMO for cardiac support is an evolving area and certainly needs further evidence. Although ECMO has a role in selected patients in context of the current pandemic, the criteria for patient selection and timing of ECMO initiation are yet to be defined. This is important to allow judicious use of available resources such resource-consumptive circumstances [21]. In this narrative review, the focus will be on the use of ECMO during previous viral outbreak as well as in COVID-19 to learn lessons regarding guidance of treatment that will benefit all of healthcare workers and patients.||1
2020-06-06||The BCG vaccine does not protect against COVID-19: Applying an economist’s toolkit to a medical question

The prospect that BCG – a vaccine used primarily against tuberculosis – might offer protection from COVID-19 has become an understandably popular hypothesis. This column finds that hope misplaced. The authors exploit a natural experiment, overlaying the large difference in BCG vaccination rates with the large differences in COVID-19 infection rates between the former East and West Germany. They find that the differences are attributable not to BCG, but to the West’s copious commuter flow patterns and the fact that the epidemic arrived there first.

As COVID-19 has spread across the globe, so has an intense search for treatments and vaccines, with numerous trials running in multiple countries. Several researchers (e.g. Hegarty et al. 2020, Miller et al. 2020, Ozdemir et al. 2020) and prominent news outlets have noticed that countries still administering an old vaccine against tuberculosis had fewer coronavirus cases and fewer deaths per capita in the outbreak’s early stages. But is that correlation evidence that the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine provides some defence against COVID-19? In this column, we describe the findings of our recent work (Bluhm and Pinkovskiy 2020) looking at the incidence of coronavirus cases along the former border between East and West Germany, using modern econometric techniques to investigate whether historical differences in vaccination policies account for the lower level of infection in the East.

Tuberculosis has been largely eradicated from the developed world, and many rich countries have stopped using the BCG vaccine. Spain, which ended mandatory BCG vaccination in 1985, experienced more than 580 coronavirus deaths per million of its population and is one of the hardest-hit countries in per capita terms. Portugal, Spain’s neighbour, continues to perform mandatory BCG vaccination to this day and has experienced only 135 coronavirus deaths per million (all numbers as of 29 May 2020). More generally, studies have documented that countries with mandatory BCG vaccination tend to have substantially fewer coronavirus cases and fewer deaths per capita than countries without mandatory vaccination, and that the intensity of the epidemic is lower for countries that began vaccinating earlier (e.g. Hegarty et al. 2020, Miller et al. 2020, Ozdemir et al. 2020). Such cross-country correlations do not imply causation (Belloc et al. 2020) and sceptics have rushed to suggest that the passive immunisation from the BCG vaccine would at best be short-lived (Faust et al. 2020). The WHO now cautions that there is currently no evidence that the vaccine protects against the novel coronavirus (WHO 2020).

Because they are often unable to perform randomised experiments, economists have developed a suite of methods to exploit “natural experiments” that occur by chance as human action unfolds. We use one of these tools—a geographic regression discontinuity analysis (Dell 2010)—to determine whether coronavirus prevalence changes markedly at the Cold War-era border between East and West Germany, whose vaccination policies differed prior to their reunification in 1990. East Germany had mandatory BCG vaccination until reunification, while West Germany stopped voluntary but de facto universal vaccination in 1975.

Our setting presents a puzzle of its own. Many observers in Germany have noticed a much lower coronavirus prevalence in the former East than in the West but found few convincing explanations for the difference. Moreover, low mortality in Germany as a whole has been the subject of widespread speculation. We provide formal evidence that there is indeed a sizable discontinuity in COVID-19 cases at the border, flexibly controlling for everything continuous there. Other important variables—such as disposable income and average age—also jump at the border, but do not explain the discontinuity in COVID-19 cases. However, the difference in coronavirus prevalence is uniform across age groups rather than being dependent on whether individuals were born before or after the cessation of (near) universal vaccination in each part of the country. This fact cannot be explained by a broader immunity acquired via the BCG vaccine.

COVID-19 prevalence is much higher in former West than in East Germany

We start our analysis with a map of coronavirus cases by county as of 26 April, using data from the Robert Koch Institute. The former border between East and West Germany is outlined in red. The darker the shading of a county, the more coronavirus cases it has per million inhabitants. Several counties with high concentrations stand out (such as Heinsberg, bordering the Netherlands, and much of Bavaria – both places where the epidemic was first recorded). There is clearly a greater density of coronavirus cases around major cities (Berlin, Hamburg, and Stuttgart), as in the US. More importantly, we immediately see that counties just to the west of the former border are a much darker shade of blue than counties just to the east.

Notes: Illustration of the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in Germany as of 26 April 2020. The map shows the log (1 + cases/million people) in each county using population data from 2018.

To formalise the intuition of this map, we use a regression discontinuity design in which we nonparametrically estimate coronavirus prevalence as a function of the distance to the border and compare estimates from the eastern and western sides. We present a graphical representation of this exercise in the chart below, where the dependent variable is the logarithm of coronavirus cases per million inhabitants—a gauge of the exponential spread of the virus. The jump at the border is about 0.7 log points, which implies that there are half as many cases per capita in a former East German county than in a West German county just across the border. This halving of cases dominates the variation in coronavirus prevalence among counties in the East (where it is uniformly low) and is sizable relative to the average prevalence in the West. Far-away counties in Bavaria or near the border with France have the highest cases, but a smooth spread from there would imply a continuous decline, and cannot explain the precipitous drop at the border.

Notes: Illustration of the discontinuity log (1 + cases/million people) across the former border between West and East Germany. The figure shows non-parametric local polynomial estimates for bins of the dependent variable, where each bin is 20 km wide; 95% confidence intervals are shaded in grey.

BCG vaccination is not driving this discontinuity

Our key piece of evidence makes the BCG hypothesis appear very unlikely. We exploit the fact that East Germany had mandatory vaccination from 1953 to 1990, while West Germany recommended vaccinating everyone from 1961 to 1975. If the vaccine protects against the virus, then we would expect that discontinuities in detected cases among people aged 15-34 (most of whom did not get the vaccine anywhere) would be small or non-existent. On the other hand, discontinuities among people aged 35-59 (all of whom were vaccinated in the East, as opposed to only those above age 45 in the West) should be larger. The chart below shows that the discontinuities in coronavirus prevalence for both age groups are stark and roughly identical in size, contradicting what we would expect to see if the BCG hypothesis were true. Moreover, for early April, we have more fine-grained data on cases for individual ages, allowing us to form age groups that directly correspond to the policy shift in BCG vaccination. They also show discontinuities that are equal or even smaller in the older cohort.

Figure 3 Age-specific discontinuity in log (1 + cases/million) at former border

Notes: Illustration of the discontinuity log (1 + cases/million people) across the former border between West and East Germany for different age groups. The left panel shows results for ages 15-34 and the right panel shows results for ages 35-59. Both figures show non-parametric local polynomial estimates for bins of the dependent variable, where each bin is 20 km wide; 95% confidence intervals are shaded in grey.

Alternative explanations: Commuter flows and the geography of the early outbreak

If the BCG vaccine does not explain the East-West differential in coronavirus cases, then what does? Historically, pandemics have been spread by the movement of people and trade from one area to another (Voth 2020), so in that spirit we investigate Germany’s commuting patterns. If those who live in the West work in the West and, in spite of a large wave of migration post-reunification, most former East Germans still work in the East, it may be the case that travel flows have not readjusted completely since reunification. In other words, Western counties along the former border may remain more disconnected from their Eastern neighbours than they would if a national border had never divided them. As the epidemic started in the West, it may have had a harder time spreading eastward because relatively fewer people commute between East and West than commute across comparable distances within the West or within the East. The eastward spread of the virus was then further interrupted by the nation-wide lockdown instituted on 22 March.

We simulate a canonical SIR model of the coronavirus epidemic in each German county, allowing infections to spread along commuting patterns starting from the distribution of coronavirus cases on 29 February (Bjørnstad and Grenfell 2008, Wesolowski et al. 2017). We find that in the simulated data, the number of cases also discontinuously declines as one crosses from West to East over the former border, with a decline smaller but close in magnitude to the decline observed in the actual data.

2020-06-06||Valuating health vs wealth: The effect of information and how this matters for COVID-19 policymaking

The behavioural interventions to control the spread of COVID-19 present trade-offs between health and wealth. To be successful, an understanding of how the public currently values lives over economic loss is needed. A survey experiment in the US and UK finds that people highly prioritise saving lives, but this valuation will change as economic losses mount. Individual differences in valuation also predict individual compliance with COVID-19 policies, and information on COVID-19 deaths and income losses can affect valuations. Caution in relaxing the lockdown will help build public support and mitigate polarising effects and, through increasing compliance, improve its economic efficacy.

In the absence of medicine-based responses to COVID-19, policymakers have to rely on behavioural interventions to control the transmission of the virus. Yet, at least in the short run, these interventions create a trade-off between saving lives and saving the economy – a ‘health–wealth trade-off’. The lockdown restrictions on individual freedoms, for example, saved lives by preventing transmission, but they came at the cost of lost output and income (Baldwin and Weder di Mauro 2020).

Relaxing a lockdown involves the same trade-off but in reverse: the economy recovers but at a cost of an increased threat of virus transmission. There are similar potential medium-term trade-offs in the choice between strategies of herd immunity and so-called ‘hammer and dance’ (Pueyo 2020). Faced with such health–wealth trade-offs, how should policymakers decide where to locate the balance?

This question has led policymakers to dust off risk-valuation manuals to see whether the proposed movement makes cost-benefit good sense. For instance, the OECD (2012) suggests, on the basis of evidence, that a figure between $1.5–$4.5 million should be used as the statistical value of life, with a base value of $3 million (the EU uses a slightly wider range and a higher base value of $3.6 million).

Armed with such a figure, consider the UK lockdown. The Imperial College modellers predicted that lockdown would save several hundred thousand lives (Ferguson et al. 2020), whilst current estimates point to a lockdown loss of more than 10% of GDP (Bank of England 2020); 10% of GDP is £221,489 million. Thus, even if only one, rather than several, hundred thousand lives had been saved, the lockdown would have cost about £2 million per life saved and would have produced a net benefit, using the OECD’s base figure valuation of a life at $3 million. Beyond 100,000 lives saved, the net benefit from lockdown quickly becomes enormous.

Setting aside arguments against using cost-benefit analysis in such decisions, there are two problems with recycling OECD (or other) estimates of the value of a statistical life. First, the figures vary widely and – although the OECD proposes a range, any part of which would probably make the lockdown yield a net benefit – they refer to the value of a statistical life. COVID-19, however, produces mortality disproportionately in the old and those with co-morbidities.

So perhaps the alternative quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) approach – whereby quality-adjusted life-years saved are valued – should be used. With as much as 20% of those over 70 who die from COVID-19 being likely to die within one year anyway, and a QALY value of between £20–30,000, a positive net benefit from lockdown becomes much less likely.

The second problem is deeper. The policy choices relate to COVID-19 deaths; not imaginary deaths in the past and not some medical intervention that might prolong life by one year. Thus, what plausibly matters is how people currently value such deaths. This is for two reasons.

First, how people value health over wealth in this period obviously matters for the politics of these decisions. Politicians are re-elected by the people who assess government performance by their own lights; not by how well the government executed a manual’s implicit assessment.

Second, people’s current valuation may matter because there is evidence that people are more likely to follow rules when they agree with them (Tyler 1990). We don’t know whether this is the case for COVID-19 lockdown policies, but if it is, then the efficacy of any lockdown or its relaxation also depends on whether its movement on a health–wealth trade-off accords with the public’s relative valuation of health over wealth.

Of course, although these considerations are real, they would not matter if we had reason to believe that people’s assessments in such matters were relatively constant (in that case, the OECD’s summary might apply). Yet we don’t. In fact, we know such assessments are extremely sensitive to exposure to the risk in question (e.g. Gigerenzer 2014) – think of the exodus from flying in the US post-9/11.

So, features specific to COVID-19 will influence people’s current COVID related health–wealth valuation. This is why we conducted a survey experiment in the UK and the US to see how people actually value health over wealth in the context of COVID-19 and the lockdown (Hargreaves Heap et al. 2020).

The survey consists of a sequence of binary choices between pairs of health and wealth outcomes for each country. The sequence is designed so that anyone who values both ‘lives saved’ and ‘average household income’, and has a preference ordering over their various combinations, will switch at one point from the option that always does as well or better than the other on health, to the option that does better on wealth. Where they switch is an indicator of their relative valuation of health over wealth and can be interpreted as giving the lower bound for the value of life.

The experimental element comes from asking participants to make this sequence of choices a second time. After the first occasion, the participants engage in another task and are then divided into three sub-groups. One sub-group receives an information prompt on the predicted number of COVID-19 deaths (per million) by August; another receives an information prompt on the predicted loss of GDP per capita through lockdown measures in 2020. The final sub-group is our control group; they hear a short piece of instrumental music instead.

The participants then make the decisions over health and wealth combinations again. This experimental element allows us to test for the robustness of the health–wealth valuations (do they change much in the control?) and for whether they respond in predictable ways to information on deaths and income losses (in the two information treatments).

We find that in the peak of the pandemic in the UK and US, the average implicit value of a COVID-19 life was extremely high by the standards of the OECD figures. The average value is a factor of around ten times greater than usual. This means that the lockdown policy accorded very well with the public’s preferences for health over wealth at that time. Indeed, the lockdown policies were met by increased support for the governments imposing them (Blais et al. 2020).

We also find that the individual variation in this valuation predicts individual compliance with the lockdown measures in both countries. So, policymakers do need to care about what the people think in this matter, not just for political reasons of re-election, but also because it affects the efficacy of any policy change through its influence on compliance.

This experimental evidence gives us a clue as to whether the valuations will change as the experience of COVID-19 deaths recedes and income losses mount (see Midoes 2020): they will.

On the one hand, the high valuation of COVID-19 lives saved implies that any relaxation of the lockdown – which will produce a spike in COVID-19 deaths – will court unpopularity and lack of compliance. On the other hand, information on COVID-19-related fatalities and growing income losses will lead people to adjust their relative valuation of health over wealth towards wealth (see Hargreaves Heap et al. 2020).

In short, the longer that relaxation of the lockdown is delayed, people will become more tolerant of any increased deaths associated with the relaxation because income losses increase with delay. This insight complements an earlier one on the gains from the delay that come from better information on how to relax a lockdown (Santos-Pinot and Mata 2020).

Moreover, whilst unexpected deaths will, in general, put a brake on the drift to valuing wealth relatively more highly, they also tend to polarise the valuations of health over wealth in the UK (Hargreaves Heap et al 2020); this is in a context where there is already evidence of polarisation in other respects (see Gambacorta et al. 2020). Both effects reinforce the argument for caution in relaxing the lockdown because a delay will help avoid the braking and polarising effect of unexpected deaths on people’s valuation of health relative to wealth as it otherwise drifts – in both the UK and the US – towards wealth.

The politics of loosening (and potentially re-tightening) lockdowns are not straightforward (see Aksoy et al. 2020), not least because standard tools employed, such as information provision (see Fetzer et al. 2020), might generate unintended consequences that undermine policy objectives. At a minimum, they should at least be facilitated by analyses of the public’s relative valuations of health and wealth.

2020-06-06||O past week Bangladesh, India and Pakistan have largely lifted nationwide lockdowns intended to curb the spread of covid-19. The freeing of 1.7bn people—more than a fifth of humanity—from varied restrictions will bring relief to the region’s battered economies. Alas, it promises no relief from the pandemic itself. In luckier countries, stay-at-home rules reduced the number of new infections. In South Asia they managed only to moderate the disease’s acceleration, but not to halt it (see chart). The lifting of the lockdowns, in turn, is likely to hasten its spread again.

With some 350,000 confirmed cases and fewer than 9,000 deaths so far, the region’s toll looks relatively modest. Yet those numbers disguise both widespread undercounting and a rate of growth that was frightening even before the lifting of restrictions. At the current pace, the numbers are doubling every two weeks, suggesting that by the end of July, when some models predict the outbreak will peak, the official number infected may reach 5m and the death toll could approach 150,000.

Low levels of testing mean that the real numbers could be far worse. One foreign health official in Pakistan reckons the death toll is between two and three times the government’s count. John Clemens of ICDDR,B (formerly the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh), estimates that Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital, may already have as many as 750,000 cases, even though the official national tally is less than 60,000.

In harder-hit parts of the region, health services are under severe strain. Madhuri, a 46-year-old nurse in Thane, a suburb of Mumbai, had been working 12-hour shifts with no days off from April 1st until she herself caught covid-19 from a patient in May. The government hospital where she works does not treat the disease, passing positive cases to designated covid hospitals. But Madhuri (not her real name) says her colleagues must instead cope with the patients those places no longer treat. “We now do 60-70 deliveries a day, up from 40-50 in normal times, in addition to stab wounds, accidents and so on.” Her hospital’s 20-bed intensive care unit is staffed by just two nurses and its 16-bed isolation ward by just one, she says. Her experience is far from unusual. Three medical interns at another hospital in the centre of Mumbai recently released a video claiming that they had been left for hours in sole charge of 35 seriously ill covid-19 patients, with no doctors, nursing or cleaning staff to help. Another viral video revealed that corpses wrapped in plastic had been left in a covid ward full of patients, owing to lack of space in a hospital morgue. Staff at hospitals across India have repeatedly protested against unsafe conditions, poor equipment and long working hours. In Delhi, the capital, some 600 health workers have tested positive for covid-19—including 329 at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, the country’s grandest government hospital. Overall, India has a ratio of doctors and nurses to population that is half China’s and a quarter of Europe’s. And the virus has now spread from better-served cities to poor rural states such as Jharkhand, where there is one doctor for every 6,000 people. Doctors in Pakistan say the government’s claim that there are adequate hospital beds is nonsense. “The situation is very, very unsatisfactory,” says Qaisar Sajjad of the Pakistan Medical Association, predicting a surge in cases stemming from the recent holiday marking the end of Ramadan. Zubair Zahir, head of a local doctors’ association in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, fears its hospitals could run out of intensive-care beds and ventilators within the next two weeks. The crisis has already squeezed other services: despite a resurgence of polio, an immunisation campaign in the province has been suspended. In India treatment of endemic diseases such as tuberculosis, which kills some 400,000 people a year, has also been impeded. In normal times, the region’s rich can largely insulate themselves from the implications of decades of puny public spending on health. “If they so much as sneeze they flee to Thailand, Singapore or India,” says a doctor at a private hospital in Dhaka. Now, she says, it is “almost impossible” to gain admission to Bangladesh’s elite hospitals, whether for covid-19 or other illnesses.

Finding places in morgues, cemeteries and crematoria is also becoming a challenge. At the municipal graveyard of Narayanganj, an area with lots of garment factories on the outskirts of Dhaka, a typical month sees fewer than 250 burials. Last month it jumped to 575, only 70 of which were officially recorded as victims of covid-19. Jawahar Baug, the biggest crematorium in Thane outside Mumbai, has seen a similar jump in custom. It has boosted its staff from 30 to 50 men working three shifts a day, while the volume of bodies they manage has grown from four to six a day to sometimes as many as 20. Delhi has relaxed a ban on traditional funeral pyres made of wood, instituted to reduce pollution, because there are too few gas-fired ovens to meet the spurt in demand.

Inevitably, the failure of all three countries to control the pandemic has led to soul-searching and blame-casting. Imran Khan, Pakistan’s prime minister, has loudly pointed out that he was never a fan of the lockdown, which he had warned would hit the poor unduly hard, and could only slow the disease. His detractors respond that a big reason for failure was precisely the half-hearted and inept way Pakistan’s lockdown was enforced. In Bangladesh, inconsistent rulemaking, a collapse in average income in slum areas of an estimated 75% and the mass return to villages of hundreds of thousands of garment-workers undermined any gains from the lockdown.

Perhaps the most egregious errors were made by India’s government. Despite imposing the most stringent and heavily policed restrictions in the region, the government failed to foresee that its measures might prompt a mass exodus from cities of tens of millions of migrant workers made suddenly destitute. The authorities first tried to block the movement, bottling migrants in urban slums with the highest infection rates, and then allowed perhaps 20m workers to leave, spreading the disease across the country. In Bihar, a state whose 110m people are among India’s poorest, more than two-thirds of covid cases identified so far have been among returning migrant workers.

Whatever the cause, the damage is now done. Farid Uddin, a gravedigger in the Bangladeshi port city of Chattogram (formerly Chittagong), comes close to tears as he explains that he and his team have scarcely slept in four days. “There are so many deaths,” he gulps. “We are overwhelmed. Please pray for us so Allah forgives us and takes back this disease.” ■||1
2020-06-06||Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said Ireland has “earned the right to be hopeful about the future again” as the Government dramatically accelerated the roadmap to lift coronavirus restrictions.

The plan to reopen the country after months of lockdown will largely end on July 20th, and only comprise four phases rather than five.

People will be able to travel within their own counties from Monday and the domestic tourism industry will reopen from June 29th in an effort to salvage some of the summer season.

However, in recommending that Ireland progress to the second phase from Monday and accelerate the lifting of restrictions, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) warned that “stricter measures” may need to be reintroduced if there was an upsurge in cases of Covid-19.

In a letter sent on Thursday to Minister for Health Simon Harris, Dr Tony Holohan, the chief medical officer, said it was “impossible to predict with certainty what the future trajectory of the Covid-19 disease will be in Ireland”.

The emergency team said the “easing of measures always has the potential to increase the risk of transmission of infection” and concerns were raised that workplaces had the potential to become “foci” for new clusters as public health measures were eased.

The acceleration in reopening came after two Cabinet meetings on Thursday night and Friday morning, with Ministers choosing to deviate from the advice of the team on two issues: the decision to allow people travel within their counties from Monday; and to allow shopping centres reopen, albeit with restrictions, on June 15th.

Some Ministers said the Cabinet had taken the initiative, while Mr Varadkar and Mr Harris said the team and the Government had worked together.

Mr Varadkar said the third phase and the fourth, final phase – which will take effect from June 29th and July 20th respectively – would be redefined in the coming weeks, in a process led by NPHET.

The Taoiseach has said he wants to lift the 14-day quarantine requirement for people arriving into Ireland from other countries which have been successful in tackling the virus – effectively allowing Irish people go on foreign holidays to certain destinations – but it is not yet clear from when this might apply.

Government sources suggested the so-called air bridges could take effect from July 20th.

Announcing the changes, Mr Varadkar said: “During this emergency we have suffered as a country, lost loved ones and changed the way that we work and live. We are making progress. We are heading in the right direction. And we have earned the right to be hopeful about the future again.”

Dr Holohan said the emergency team would “develop some guidance” around the two-metre social distancing rules for the hospitality sector during periods of low transmission.

Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin welcomed the changes, particularly the easing of restrictions on travel, while Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the acceleration was “great news all round”.

Mr Harris said everyone had a role to play in ensuring the country could “safely find a way to live alongside” coronavirus. Health Service Executive chief executive Paul Reid said now was the time for “strengthened personal vigilance”, such as doing the “small hygiene things very well”.

Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty also announced on Friday that the wage subsidy scheme, which is subsidising almost 500,000 workers, and the pandemic unemployment payment, which Ms Doherty said provided help to 600,000 people, would continue until the end of August.

From June 29th, the €350 weekly pandemic unemployment payment will drop to €203 for those who earned an average wage of €200 a week or less, while those who earned more than €200 will still receive €350. Mr Donohoe said it may be the case that the wage subsidy scheme outlasts the pandemic unemployment payment.

But other challenges face Ministers, such as the request from Minister for Transport Shane Ross for a €460 million bailout for bus and rail operators whose incomes have been reduced during the pandemic.||0

2020-06-07||New Zealand Music Month may have come to an end, but for Kiwi musicians the challenges of running the business side of their music careers continue.

In an interview for small business platform Manaaki, Matiu Walters of Six60 has opened up about the business model that took the five-piece band from their first album in 2011 to performing at sold-out stadiums throughout New Zealand in February this year.

Manaaki co-founder Pat MacFie said the chat was set up to help artists hit hard by the restrictions from Covid-19.

“We are finding on the forum that creatives are really feeling the effects of Covid-19 restrictions so it is an area we are throwing some support around.”

“Matiu and the guys have created an incredible business model that disrupts everything traditional about the music industry. So we wanted to unlock their patterns and framework to help artists who are doing it tough right now."

Walters spoke candidly on Instagram about the band's method for success, which started when they hired an engineer from the Rock Shop in Dunedin to record their first album.

Matiu explained how the band’s following grew organically in the beginning but being decisive and having “ridiculous” goals helped get them to the next level.

An early goal was to maintain control over their own music, catalogue, publishing and rights, so they established Massive Entertainment.

"It wasn't good enough to just be a band and write songs. Let's be moguls," Walters said.

Walters talked about how the band held all the takings from their first Western Springs gig and used it to fund their next 'big play' which ultimately led to their biggest year yet and sold-out stadiums in Lower Hutt, Whangarei, New Plymouth, Hamilton, Auckland and Dunedin.

He also covered some of the challenges the band faced over the years, including negative opinions around their identity.

“Some were saying it’s not white enough but it’s not brown enough, we were doing whatever we felt was cool to us, and that pissed some people off.”

“We are going to do this our way and represent this place and who we are to the maximum.”

When it comes to failures, Walters believes they are equally as important as success.

“They’re two walls you bounce between. As long as you’re going in the right direction, you’ve got to take it as it comes.”

His advice to those in business now is to keep moving.

“Get off your ass and begin. And never stop. Just keep going and never take ‘no’ for an answer.”

The Government has announced a $175 million package to support jobs in the music and arts sector and last Saturday Six60 played a recording of their last Western Springs Concert on TVNZ.

MacFie said it is great to see support for the cultural sector and hoped big business and fans would get behind the industry as well.

“There are many ways we can show Manaaki. Music gets us through the tough times and now, as a country, we need to help the music makers get through. We want the creatives out there to know they are not alone.”||2

 Sunday, RTÉ One, 9.30pm

 Okay, Montrose, the jig is up. We know your little game. You’re trying to distract us during lockdown by rerunning some of the best telly programmes around. Did Leo put you up to it? First it was the return of Love/Hate, and now it’s another outing for the wonderful Derry Girls. You’re hoping we’ll be so immersed in the comedic activities of Erin, Orla, Claire, Michelle – and James – we won’t notice how our civil liberties have been trashed and we’ll be too busy laughing our heads off to bother storming Government Buildings to protest at the loss of freedoms.

Derry Girls is set in the titular city in the 1990s, at the height of the Troubles, and stars Saoirse-Monica Jackson as self-delusional teenager Erin, with Tara Lynne O’Neill as her tough, uncompromising mother, Tommy Tiernan as the hapless dad, and Ian McIlhinney as the fearsome grandad. Comedic genius runs through every scene in this series, and there are stand-out performances from the cast, including a meme-friendly turn from Siobhan McSweeney as the terminally jaded school principal Sr Michael. What, there’s an anti-lockdown rally on O’Connell Street? Sorry, I’m busy, er, washing my hands.

In times of great crisis, we look for a great leader to bring us comfort. A calm, authoritative presence to soothe our fevered brow and tell us everything’s going to be all right. And lo! Daniel O’Donnell has answered Ireland’s call, and is inviting us all into his home in Kincasslagh for a brand new series that promises to banish all pandemic anxiety from our souls. Daniel will dispense great wisdom and spiritual guidance, dish out the chat and the craic with special guests, and even demonstrate his newly acquired hula-hooping skills. The nation can breathe easier knowing that Daniel is watching out for our wellbeing from his Donegal eyrie.

In the first episode, Daniel chats with Clannad star Moya Brennan, from just up the road in Gweedore, about how Covid-19 has disrupted the band’s plans for a farewell tour. We’ll also meet one of the many Irish couples whose wedding plans have been thrown into disarray by coronavirus, and Daniel will reconnect with his old friend Gloria Hunniford. His better half, Majella, will also drop in at regular intervals, but will Daniel sing an aul’ song? Is the pope a Catholic?

Romeo and Juliet: Royal Shakespeare Company

 Sunday, BBC4, 9pm

 Shakespeare’s most tragic love story is revived in this modern interpretation by the RSC. Filmed live in Stratford-upon-Avon, deputy artistic director Erica Whyman’s lively 2018 reimagining focuses on the pains of adolescence and the difference in settling conflicts with words instead of violence. Bally Gill and Karen Fishwick are utterly believable and very touching in the title roles, joined by Afolabi Alli as Paris, Donna Banya as Gregory and Charlotte Josephine as the bold Mercutio.

In 2018 Britain was rocked by the Windrush scandal, after it emerged that the Home Office was detaining and deporting migrants and children of migrants brought to the UK from the Caribbean as part of the so-called Windrush generation. These migrants were British subjects, and many were born in the UK or had arrived before 1973. But thanks to then Home secretary Theresa May’s immigration policies, they were targeted because their papers were not “in order”. This one-off drama tells the story of one such citizen, Anthony Bryan (played by Patrick Robinson), who has been living in the UK since he was eight, and now has a family of his own. When Bryan applies for a passport in order to visit his mother in Jamaica, he learns to his horror that there is no record of him as a British citizen. Soon his life is turned upside-down as he is forced out of his job, denied benefits and idetained as an illegal immigrant.

Inside Monaco: Playground of the Rich

 Monday, BBC2, 9pm

 Last summer the BBC sent a camera crew into the tiny but powerful principality of Monaco to find out how the other 1 per cent lives. Monaco is the second-smallest country in the world, but it’s also one of the richest, and if you’re not at least a millionaire, dahling, then you’ve no business being here. So why is Monaco so attractive for the super-rich? Simple: they pay no income tax! We meet some of these super-rich on their home playground, as well as some of the army of staff on helicopters (Monaco’s taxis) superyachts and luxury hotels who must cater to their every whim. We also gain access to the palace of Prince Albert II and go trackside at the Monaco Grand Prix with former Formula One winner David Coulthard and F1 owner Eddie Jordan. Since this series was made, Monaco has been hit with coronavirus, with 99 cases and four deaths out of a population of 38,300, but you can bet its citizens are having a very comfortable lockdown.

Every aspiring writer dreams of getting that elusive book deal, but does that mean your life is one happy-ever-after? For young writer Arabella Essuiedu, the path to literary success is fraught with personal danger, and when she is sexually assaulted in a nightclub, the story takes on a decidedly darker hue. This 12-part drama, created by and starring Michaela Coel, explores issues around consent, and also asks a very pointed question: where do you draw the line between liberation and exploitation?

The Bidding Room

 Monday, BBC1, 3.45pm

 This new series comes from the makers of The Repair Shop, although some viewers may also be reminded of Channel 4’s Four Rooms. Hosted by Nigel Havers, The Bidding Room is set in an emporium in the Yorkshire countryside where a group of expert dealers will be trying to outbid each other to buy extraordinary items brought in by the public. To make sure the sellers get the best deals, they will meet the room’s valuation expert who will talk to them about their item’s history – and what it’s potentially worth. First up in this opening episode is Paul from Devon, who has an unusual piece of hairdressing memorabilia. To get a good price, the dealers will first have to work out what it is. Meanwhile, Belinda from Salford is hoping to clean up with something she salvaged from the rubbish.

Ocean Autopsy: The Secret Story of Our Seas

 Monday, BBC4, 9pm

 The world’s waters are split into five distinct oceans, but in reality, they are part of one huge global system. This system has been instrumental in shaping our destiny for millions of years. But now, in the 21st century, it’s humankind that is shaping the destiny of our oceans. In this new film, viewers will embark on a journey to carry out an autopsy on the ocean itself, where leading oceanographer Dr Helen Czerski and zoologist Dr George McGavin will reveal the startling changes it is undergoing. The duo will look at the water’s toxicity due to industrial chemicals and investigate a plague of microplastics saturating the water.

The Secret She Keeps

 Tuesday, RTÉ One, 10.15pm

Two women, both with very different lives, but both apparently wanting the same things. This new Australian psychological thriller series, based on the bestselling novel by Michael Robotham, is a tale of what happens when you covet another person’s seemingly perfect life. Meghan (Jessica De Gouw) is a successful “mommy blogger”, presenting an image of maternal bliss to her vast internet following. Agatha (Laura Carmichael) is a supermarket shelf-stacker who envies Meghan and longs for an Instagram-friendly family of her own. But of course, nothing is as it seems: Meghan’s carefully constructed online image is threatening to fall apart, and when Agatha announces to her ex-boyfriend that she’s pregnant, things really take a darker turn.

In 1972, English writer, cartographer, mathematician, artist and illustrator Tim Robinson upped sticks from his native Yorkshire and moved to the Aran Islands with his wife, Mairead. He quickly “went native”, creating magnificent maps of the local landscape, and chronicling the nature, culture, language and customs of the region. Robinson, a highly respected member of Aosdána and the Royal Irish Academy, wrote several acclaimed books, including his award-winning Connemara trilogy (Listening to the Wind, The Last Pool of Darkness and A Little Gaelic Kingdom). He sadly died in London in April after contracting coronavirus – just two weeks after Mairead’s death. As a tribute to this towering figure in the west of Ireland, TG4 is reshowing Pat Collins’s 2011 documentary on one of Connemara’s most celebrated residents.

2020-06-07||Many governments are slowly unwinding their economies from nationwide lockdowns. However, re-opening the economy entails a serious trade-off between fostering economic output and keeping the spread of infection low. This column reports several re-opening scenarios for the UK economy, documenting their projected impacts on both GDP and the spread of the virus. The results suggest that it is best to re-open upstream industries first, as they provide a large direct and indirect economic boost at a relatively lower cost in terms of further epidemic spreading.

The economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are large and have affected some industries and occupations more than others (Koren and Peto 2020, del Rio-Chanona et al. 2020). For example, labour supply shocks strongly affected construction, but were absent in sectors considered essential. Yet, given the interconnected nature of the economy, even the sectors shielded from the direct shocks eventually face adverse consequences. First-order shocks are amplified through production networks and the interaction of supply and demand (Inoue and Todo 2020, Barrot et al. 2020, Mandel and Veetil 2020, Bonadio et al. 2020, Baqaee and Farhi, 2020). For instance, in Norway, within a month, two thirds of the layoffs happened in businesses that were not directly hit by the shocks (Alstadsæter et al. 2020).

Governments that are now seeking to re-open their economies cannot ignore these network interactions. To determine the relative economic boosts of different re-opening scenarios, they need to consider the risks of an unbalanced re-opening that may worsen supply chain bottlenecks. Besides, they must also consider that the risk of infection faced by workers varies across industries and search for an appropriate compromise between increasing economic output and controlling the epidemic spreading.

In a recent paper (Pichler et al. 2020), we investigate several scenarios for the phased re-opening of the UK economy by modelling production network effects explicitly. At one extreme, we find that re-opening only a very limited number of industries can create supply chain ‘mis-coordination problems’ that may even decrease aggregate output. At the other extreme, re-opening all industries without extra precautionary measures would increase the epidemic reproduction number (R ) to above one, and may cause a second wave of the epidemic. Our results suggest that there is a reasonable compromise that yields a relatively small increase in epidemic spreading and delivers a substantial boost in economic output.

In an interconnected economy, it is intrinsically difficult to assess the economic impact of re-opening only some industries. Each industry relies on other industries, sometimes critically. For example, the metal manufacturing industry cannot operate without supplies from the mining industry. Opening parts of the economy without considering these relationships could cause severe supply chain disruptions.

We designed a novel economic model that acknowledges the unique features of the current crisis, and specifically (i) deals simultaneously with supply and demand shocks, (ii) allows for sluggish consumption recovery, and (iii) incorporates sectoral inventory buffers. The core of the model is an industrial production network that distinguishes between critical and non-critical inputs. To determine which inputs are critical, we use a survey of IHS Markit industry analysts, who were asked “Can production continue in industry X if input Y is not available for two months?”.

Our model is calibrated to the UK economy and initialised with first-order supply and demand shocks derived in del Rio-Chanona et al. (2020). Validation exercises show that our model is in good agreement with recent estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and is in line with the sectoral unemployment data of the US. Our model predicts a reduction in GDP of 1.7% for the first quarter and a reduction of 21.5% for the second quarter of 2020 (compared to the last quarter of 2019). These estimates are in the range of other forecasts for the UK economy, although on the more pessimistic side.

Figure 1 Simulation results for implementing and unwinding the UK lockdown

As in most economic models, the predicted outcomes depend fairly strongly on the choice of the production function. We assume that non-critical inputs are not necessary (to avoid the unrealistic collapse of the economy that would take place under a standard Leontief model). However, we do assume that critical inputs are absolutely necessary, and in fixed proportion, leading to non-trivial network effects. For instance, we find the counter-intuitive result that re-opening only a few industries can lower aggregate output. This happens because when some sectors of the economy are output-constrained, other industries compete for these scarce inputs. Important industries may then run out of inventory and eventually lack critical inputs to operate.

If re-opening only a handful of selected industries can cause problems, re-opening should be broad enough. However, this can of course be very risky in terms of infections. This prompted us to evaluate the effects of the re-opening scenarios on R , the reproduction number of the epidemic. We decompose the epidemic transmission rate into five sources of infections: infections at the workplace, at school, during consumption activities, during commuting, and finally, infections that are not influenced by whether or not an industry is open. We also estimate the infection risk in each industry. For instance, the healthcare sector is responsible for more work-related infections than the forestry sector. This is because health workers have more contacts, each contact has a higher infection risk, and there are more healthcare than forestry workers overall. As another example, the retail and restaurant sectors contribute much more to consumption infections than the mining sector, because there are virtually no direct consumption activities in the mining industry.

By splitting sources of infection by economic activity, we can assess both the economic and epidemic impact of different scenarios.

We then use this simple epidemic model to study five re-opening scenarios. First, to establish a proper benchmark, we quantify the effect on epidemic spreading if the lockdown continues. Second, we analyse the impact of fully re-opening agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and construction (which were not entirely closed during the UK lockdown). Third, we open all upstream industries but leave all non-essential sectors in consumer-facing industries closed (retail, accommodation and food, recreational and personal services). The fourth scenario is the same as the third but assumes that schools are fully open instead of receiving only children of workers who cannot work from home. In the fifth scenario, we re-open all industries for work and consumption.

Figure 2 shows the economy-epidemic trade-off. There is considerable uncertainty in our predictions, but one conclusion appears robust: A large part of the ‘upstream’ economy (that was closed until recently) tends to have a relatively lower risk for workers, little risk for consumers, and also has higher economic value. Essentially, this is because large parts of manufacturing and business services have high ‘value-added’ and are upstream, meaning that they provide inputs to other industries. Also, these upstream industries are rarely selling directly to consumers, and thus present limited risks in their contribution to the pandemic. As a result, there is a ‘sweet spot’ in which we can re-open upstream industries but leave many consumer-facing industries closed. This results in a relatively small increase in risk of infection and a significant economic boost.

Figure 2 How different re-opening scenarios impact R0 and GDP

Notes: The left-hand vertical axis shows the reproduction number R0 (multi-coloured bars). The right-hand vertical axis gives the share of GDP compared to pre-lockdown levels (blue bars).

As Figure 2 makes clear, the scenario “All except consumer-facing industries” increases the reproduction number only marginally but increases GDP by 8%, relative to lockdown a month after these industries are re-opened. In contrast, re-opening the entire economy only increases GDP by an additional 2%. Thus, our recommended scenario has most of the economic benefits, and only minimal cost in terms of increased infections. Of course, there remains a lot of uncertainty in many estimates, and we cannot be sure that this scenario would not bring R above one. Similarly, we cannot be sure that re-opening completely would bring R above one (if stringent physical distancing and environmental health measures are in place). However, our results do indicate that the cost-benefit ratio of an industry being open is likely to be lower for upstream industries.

2020-06-07||In and out of lockdowns: Identifying the centrality of economic activities

The effects of the Covid-19 lockdowns have been severe worldwide. Although most activities were reopened in May, Italian GDP is expected to drop by around 10% in 2020. This column argues that a targeted exit from the lockdown in Italy could have been implemented instead. It identifies those activities with the greatest impact on the national economy, but with low risks for those returning to work and for the country at large. The methodology could also be applied in other countries and in the in the unfortunate event of a new wave of contagion and a new lockdown.

The effects of the Covid-related lockdowns are massive (see McKibbin and Fernando 2020). In Italy, we estimate a 44% reduction in the value of potential output produced, peaking at 69% for construction and real estate and 63% for mechanics. Activities were closed following an administrative decision of the government, differently from other countries like Germany or France, where the lockdown was in most cases the indirect effect of social confinement (Barrot et al. 2020, Fadinger and Schymik 2020). As a result, GDP in Italy is expected to drop by around 10% in 2020, according to most forecasts.

In Italy, most activities were reopened in May, although with social distancing and health safety guidelines. In this column, we argue that a targeted exit from the lockdown could have been implemented instead, giving priority to those activities with the greatest impact on the national economy. This targeted strategy, combined with an assessment of the inherent health risks of each activity (as done by the government), would have reduced the risks of a second wave of contagion for those returning to work and for the country at large, while achieving a reactivation of gross output and jobs similar to the general reopening actually implemented.

In a recent paper (Barba Navaretti et al. 2020), we propose an approach to identify production activities for which total or partial closures (and consequently reopening) would have the greatest impact on the country's GDP, output, and employment, using input-output tables and network centrality measures in production chains. Our approach provides an operative tool for clearly identifying the economic effects of lockdowns at a granular level. We show, for example, that the activation of just 20 core micro-sectors would raise the capacity of the Italian economy, as measured by the value of gross output, from 56% (under the administrative lockdown as of 4 May) to 76%, with respect to the pre-Covid-19 level. The impact would be especially sizeable in core production chains. For instance, the value of gross output of mechanics would increase from 37% to 84% and of constructions from 31% to 77%. We estimate that the administrative lockdown, as of 4 May, if kept for an entire year, would have implied a drop in GDP of 52%. The reopening of the sectors identified in our analysis would limit this fall to 16% (assuming the other activities remain closed for a whole year).

Understanding how to minimise the impact of the lockdown on the economy is of course important to design the re-opening strategy, but it is even more crucial in the event of having to face a possible resurgence of the Covid-19 pandemic or a new pandemic in the future. We all wish these events would never happen, but the main lesson from these tragic months is that we can no longer be unprepared in confronting them.

Identifying core sectors of the economy is not easy, because size is not the only issue. Given the tangled nature of value chains, there are activities that may seem insignificant from a quantitative point of view, but are fundamental links in several production chains, and therefore have a significant indirect impact on the production capacity of the country. Input-output (IO) tables are the starting point to unfold the interconnections among different sectors of activity. A parallel strand of analysis, closer to the business and management literature, has developed from the concept of production or supply chains, building on the seminal contribution of Porter (1985). We merge these two strands of the literature, integrating information from the IO matrices of the Italian economy (produced by Istat), with those from the structure of the value chains of the Italian economy, built by Prometeia. In our analysis, we exploit two sets of analytical tools that have been developed in the recent years: the methodology to extract some sectors of economic activities from IO matrices proposed by Dietzenbacher and Lahr (2013), and the techniques used by social network analysis to identify key players within a system (Jackson 2010).

The tangled web of the economy

To disentangle the intricacies of the Italian economy we move in three steps.

First, among the 63 sectors of the national IO tables , we identify those in which closure causes the largest drop of GDP, thus simulating the effect of their total or partial lockdown as implemented by the government decrees of 22 March and 10 April (Dietzenbacher and Lahr 2013).

Table 1 below lists the sectors for which a yearly closure (as of Italy’s Prime Minister Decrees of 22 March and 10 April 2020) would have an impact on GDP greater than 3%.

Table 1 Impact of one year of administrative lockdown on GDP by industry, as of IO tables

Notes: The table reports the estimates of the drop in GDP caused by the lockdown of a sector’s economic activities as of Italy’s Prime Minister Decrees of 22 March and 10 April 2020, if kept for an entire year. Only sectors with an estimated drop larger than 3% of GDP are listed.

The size of the decline in GDP can be decomposed into three factors: (i) the size of the sector, (ii) the degree of interconnection between the sector and other upstream and downstream sectors, and (iii) the degree of closure of the sector imposed by the Ministerial Decrees (i.e. the larger the extent of the lockdown, the larger the economic impact).

The sectors identified at NACE 2 digits are large and made of heterogeneous activities. At the same time, activities which are relatively small and have small weights in input-output tables may provide crucial inputs or crucial outlets to more than one production chain. Hence their closure may nevertheless endanger a large share of national output. This effect would not be detected by input-output table.

For this reason, as our second step, we revert to finer industry statistics, and also to the analysis of specific production chains.

Our units of analysis are the 192 micro-sectors included in production chains. We focus on those included in the core NACE 2 digits sectors identified above in Table 1. We use social network analysis to study the links among each micro-sector and identify the most central ones within and between production chains.

The literature on social networks has proposed several measures to characterise the relevance of each node in addition to the number of connections. We choose eigenvector centrality, which estimates the relative relevance of a node within a network. Micro-sectors with a higher eigenvector centrality, therefore, are more relevant within each production chain and across a larger number of production chains.

Figure 1 provides a representation of our network. Each dot represents a micro-sector, with its size proportional to its eigenvector centrality. The ‘tails’ in the picture represent production chains and their dots correspond to micro-sectors which only belong to a single production chain, therefore having lower centrality values. Dots in the centre represent micro-sectors with high centrality values because they interact with many micro-sectors across different production chains (e.g. wholesalers of intermediate industrial goods).

The micro-sectors are then ranked according to their eigenvector centrality. We have identified three groups of micro-sectors. A first group includes the 20 most central micro-sectors, with a total value of production when fully open of over €820 billion (23% of the total production of the Italian economy). As of 4 May, these micro-sectors were operating at a mere 13% of their potential output. Of the approximately four million people employed before the crisis, just over half a million were at work on 4 May. If these 20 micro-sectors were allowed to operate at full capacity, the total value of output of the Italian economy would rise from 56% of its potential to as much 76%.

Nonetheless, while inspecting production chains, one immediately realises that in some of them (e.g. fashion) many core activities, such as clothing and footwear, would still remain closed, making the opening up of the identified micro-sectors ineffective for these production chains. We therefore consider a second set of the next 20 micro-sectors in terms of centrality, which are less central than the initial 20, but still large and with a crucial role in core production chains.

Finally, by combining information on the centrality of the network with qualitative assessments regarding the articulation of the individual production chains, one can also identify ten additional micro-sectors. Since they are relatively small, accounting for only 3.9% of total production, they cannot be identified by our procedure. Yet they are crucial enablers of entire production chains (e.g. packaging paper for the food industry or textile finishing in fashion).

Table 2 reports output capacity for each production chain (measured as gross value of output) compared to pre Covid levels, under four scenarios: the administrative lockdown as of 4 May (only essential activities are allowed - column 1) and following the opening up of the core 20 (column 2), 40 (column 3), and 50 (column 4) micro-sectors.

2020-06-07||The Office of the Basic Education Commission (Obec) on Saturday promised students entering Mathayom 1 and Mathayom 4 levels will have seats at some schools for the new semester despite national examinations being delayed for more than two months because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

"Parents of students who fail the exams and cannot get into the schools they wanted can contact Obec offices in their areas. Obec will find seats for these students so they can go to a new school on July 1," Amnat Wichayanuwat, Obec's secretary-general said yesterday after inspecting an examination room arrangement at Bodindecha (Sing Singhaseni) School in Bangkok.

Examinations for obtaining places in state schools for Mathayom 1 and Mathayom 4 were arranged over the weekend after a two-month delay caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Mr Amnat said Obec has tested a system of on-air and online education from May 18 to June 30 in schools before they reopen on July 1.

He said he had sent health plans to be implemented at schools to the government's Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) for approval. In the meantime, Obec has trained teachers and schools how to teach remotely to prevent the spread of Covid-19 among students.

"Obec expects that students will return to study at schools," Mr Amnat said. "We give priority to how schools manage social distancing in classrooms. However, we also prepared online education infrastructure as a backup system."

Teachers at state schools across the country have conducted test runs for online teaching from May 18.

He said state schools nationwide have been ordered to prepare social distancing measures for schools opening on July 1.

Under the "new normal", schools must arrange seats in classrooms and canteens that enable students to sit 1.5 metres to 2 metres apart, air conditioning is banned, and face shields and hand gels must be provided.

Mr Amnat and Khunying Kalaya Sophonpanich, deputy education mister, yesterday visited the entrance exams at Bodindecha (Sing Singhaseni) School to inspect sanitation and arrangements to manage any overcrowding.

Khunying Kalaya said the school strictly followed health instructions.||0
2020-06-06||At daybreak on Saturday, Charles Shay stood lonesome without any fellow veteran on the very same beach where he waded ashore 76 years ago, part of one of the most epic battles in military history that came to be known as D-Day and turned the tide of the Second World War.

Compared to last year, when many tens of thousands came to the northern French beaches of Normandy to cheer the dwindling number of veterans and celebrate three-quarters of a century of liberation from Nazi oppression, the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restrictions turned this year's remembrance into one of the eeriest ever.

"I am very sad now," said Shay, who was a 19-year-old U.S. Army medic when he landed on Omaha Beach under horrific machine-gun fire and shells. "Because of the virus, nobody can be here. I would like to see more of us here," he told The Associated Press.

Normally, 95-year-old Shay would be meeting other survivors of the 1944 battle and celebrating with locals and dignitaries alike, all not far from his home close to the beaches that defined his life.

"This year, I am one of the very few that is probably here," he said, adding that other U.S. veterans could not fly in because of the pandemic.

When a full moon disappeared over land and the sun rose the other side over the English Channel, there was no customary rumble of columns of vintage jeep and trucks to be heard, roads still so deserted hare sat alongside them.

Still the French would not let this day slip by unnoticed, such is their attachment to some 160,000 soldiers from the United States, Britain, Canada and other countries who spilled their blood to free foreign beaches and fight on to finally defeat Nazism almost one year later.

"It's a June 6 unlike any other," said Philippe Laillier, the mayor of Saint-Laurent-Sur-Mer, who staged a small remembrance around the Omaha Beach monument. "

But still we had to do something. We had to mark it."

The moment the sun broke over the ocean, the Omaha Beach theme from the film Saving Private Ryan blared across the sand for a few dozen locals and visitors dressed in vintage clothing.

The pandemic has wreaked havoc across the world, infecting more than six million people, killing over 391,000 and devastating economies. It poses a particular threat to the elderly — like the surviving D-Day veterans who are in their late nineties or older.

It has also affected the younger generations who turn out every year to mark the occasion. Most have been barred from travelling to the windswept coasts of Normandy.

The lack of a big international crowd was palpable.

In the afternoon, a flyover of French fighter jets leaving a trail of the national colours was reminiscent of the one U.S. President Donald Trump and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron watched from Colleville last year. This time, though, only a sparse crowd craned necks upward.

At the American cemetery on a bluff overseeing Omaha Beach, Shay went to pay his respects to over 9,000 servicemen, and again was the lone U.S. veteran at an intimate ceremony.

U.S. President Harry Truman's quote, "America will never forget their sacrifices," is etched into the cemetery's Orientation Pavilion.

With Americans unable to come over to Normandy this year, the French proved to be trustworthy alternates in fulfilling Truman's vow.

Ivan Thierry, 62, a local fisherman who catches sea bass around the wrecks that still litter the seabed nearby, was holding an American flag in tribute even before dawn.

"There is not nobody here. Even if we are only a dozen, we are here to commemorate," he said.||0
2020-06-06||Temyia Taiaroa winning on Satin Belt at the Foxton trials on Thursday.

Promising rider Temyia​ Taiaroa​ is proud to be the third generation of her family to become a jockey.

The Central Districts apprentice has been riding since before she can remember, and she is pleased to be following in her forebearers' footsteps.

“My granddad, Arnold Taiaroa, he was a jockey, as well as my dad (Evan), he is riding amateurs at the moment,” Taiaroa said.

“I have been riding ponies since I could walk. Mum and dad started off in Levin and I mucked out boxes when I was younger and I have just kept going. I just want to follow in my granddad and dad’s footsteps.”

While she has always enjoyed riding and being around horses, it was a horse called Fred that got Taiaroa hooked on a career in the irons.

“I started riding track work at about 12 and that was on a trotting track on an old horse called Fred, for Jack Scott.

“Back then I thought they were pulling, but now looking back on it I just wasn’t strong enough.”

Taiaroa is into her third season of riding, and like most young New Zealand jockeys, aspires to ride in Group One features across the Tasman.

“I would definitely like to ride some Group One winners and to ride in a Melbourne Cup one day.”

While Taiaroa dreams of one day riding at Flemington on the first Tuesday in November, she was content to be back riding at the trials at Foxton on Thursday, despite the wet conditions.

It was a successful day for the 18-year-old hoop, who kicked home three heat winners, including two for employer Kevin Gray.

“It’s definitely good to be back at the trials. It was a good comeback and I had a good blowout,” Taiaroa said.

“It was very wet, coming to the last heat it was nearly a Heavy11 I reckon.

“Floral Belt went very well, I was happy with her, Satin Belt was very good as well and had a good blow, and Leighs Mate finished off very strong.”

With Gray having his own private training property, Taiaroa said she was one of the lucky few jockeys who were able to maintain their fitness and continue riding over the Covid-19 lockdown.

Taiaroa has been pleased with the way her riding has progressed this term, and she is hoping to add to her 15-win tally in the last month of the remaining season.

“I’m very happy with the way things were going with 15 wins. Hopefully this winter will be very good.”

Taiaroa highlighted Credit Manager’s win over 1400m at Trentham on Wellington Cup day as a clear highlight, and she is looking forward to being reunited with the four-year-old gelding this coming season.||2
2020-06-06||The June 2020 world trends explore a new way of living and adapting to the new normal to live through the threat of COVID-19 and what is to follow after. Many brands are catering to an altered way of living by ensuring safe practices and new designs that focus around health protection.

 

 Duty Free Innovation created the special FlySafe Travel Kit for airport retail stores as an affordable addition to traveler's safety. The kit features a reusable face mask, a few pairs of disposable gloves, sanitizing wipes, and an information card. Another new concept was released by Aviointeriors and its 'Glassafe' shield concept. It is a seat design concept for airplanes made for a post-COVID reality -- it is a clear glass that separates passengers.||2
2020-06-06|In order to determine the presumed number of people who have recovered from the virus, state health officials say the patient must meet one of two criteria. For patients who were NOT hospitalized, they are considered recovered if they have not tested positive for the virus after 14 days. For patients who were hospitalized or if hospitalization was unknown, they are presumed recovered if it has been 21 days or more since they tested positive.|1
2020-06-06||Kate Langbroek's son Artie was rushed to hospital in Italy on Saturday.

The Australian radio host, 54, revealed that the 12-year-old required urgent medical assistance after suffering an allergic reaction to a bee sting.

Earlier this year, Kate revealed her family's move to Bologna, Italy had turned into a nightmare, and they hoped to be deported amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Saturday, Kate shared a picture to Instagram of Artie in a wheelchair while being treated by a doctor.

'Italian emergency room in action. Artie got stung on the foot by a bee. Allergic reaction... magnificent care,' the 54-year-old wrote.

She clarified that 'all was okay' and Artie was feeling better after leaving hospital

The sting came after the family recently ended their gruelling 10-week quarantine.

Kate said the lengthy period of self-isolation, as Italy suffered over 33,000 deaths from the virus, had made her 'a better mother' to her four children.

She also said she had learned to be 'more patient' with her family during this time.

The star and husband Peter Lewis relocated to Bologna, Italy with their four children, Lewis, 16, Sunday, 15, Artie, 12, and Jan, nine, in January 2019.

During self-isolation, Kate and husband Peter suffered several run-ins with the local police in Italy.

She said Peter was 'interrogated' for 40 minutes after being caught on his bicycle as he collected supplies for the family, accused of breaking lockdown rules.

'They basically interrogated him and gave him a piece of paper even though it was in Italian, and he couldn't understand it,' she told Fox FM's Hughesy and Ed.

'It said he's being sued by the police. I laughed and said: "Good, I hope they deport us. It's the only way we can get out of here!'''||2
2020-06-06||More than 720 new cases of the novel coronavirus were reported in Canada on Saturday — all but 41 of them from Ontario and Quebec.

As Canada surged past 95,000 cases of COVID-19, the two most populous provinces continued to account for the vast majority of new cases and deaths reported daily.

Nearly 53,000 people around the country are considered recovered.

Ontario saw 455 new cases — but only 387 of them were new since Friday — while Quebec reported 226 new infections. Quebec has more than 52,000 cases so far, while Ontario has seen more than 30,000.

Quebec has seen nearly 5,000 deaths so far, accounting for almost 64 per cent of the national death toll. Ontario has the second highest number of deaths, at just over 2,400.

Out of 70 new deaths reported on Saturday, Ontario and Quebec both reported 35 fatalities each. Quebec saw hospitalizations go down, and only 22 of the 35 deaths were classified as new.

2020-06-06||LONDON, ONT. -- Thousands of people gathered in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement in Victoria park on Saturday.

The anti-racism rally started at Victoria Park with protestors marching through Clarence Street and Wellington at 3 p.m, and ended shorty after 6 p.m on Richmond Street.

“When we are walking and we see a cop our heart just starts beating,” said Kwasi Ofosu, a protestor who was marching with his younger brother.

“What is going to happen to us, why is my heart beating, they’re [police] supposed to be protecting us not trying to destroy us or make us feel not worthy of ourselves,” says Ofosu.

The protest was peaceful except for one moment where a small group of people tried to disrupt the crowds.

The response from those involved in the march, “No violence, do not retaliate.”

The group was forced out of Victoria Park without any reported injuries.

The spokesperson of the London Black Lives Matter rally, Alexandra Kane, says the rally was in preparation for months but the message of inequality and police brutality against black people goes back centuries.

“[Racism] exists right here in London it affects me all the time,” Kane says.

“It affects me when I want to apply for a job, it affects how people view me when I cross the street…it’s starting to affect my son who is a little boy who is one-years-old and has already had racial epitaphs thrown at him,” Kane said.

Some members from London police were present at the rally but mostly stuck to the sidelines as a preventative measure.

“The London police service is committed to a safe and secure community and right now we do recognize a person’s right to freedom of expression and opinion,” said Const. Sandasha Bough.

“Our job is to make sure that it is being done safely today.”

Most people wore masks and gloves at the rally but there are criticisms surrounding the large gathering due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mayor of London Ed Holder told CTV News that he supports the Black Lives Matter message but would be attending the rally online in order to practice physical distancing measures.

The medical officer of health for Middlesex-London Health Unit, Dr. Chris Mackie, did in fact attend the rally, but he stayed inside his car.

Kane says she understands why some people did not show up and respects their choice because of the risks of spreading COVID-19, but adds that racism is a pandemic in itself.

“Movement is greater than anything I could imagine. I think we joined the world in what we are feeling and our passion and our motivation. This intensity in the air speaks volumes, this can’t happen anymore, I’m so glad we are here and able to join the world and say, ‘Black Lives Matter.’”||1
2020-06-08||SOME MIGHT dispute whether America remains the “indispensable nation”, a phrase deployed in 1998 by Madeleine Albright, then the country’s secretary of state. But it is certainly still the nation that cannot be ignored, the one that, in a sense, sets the political weather globally. So when it goes through a trauma as it has since the killing by the police of George Floyd, the impact is felt worldwide. Mr Floyd’s death has provoked popular protests in dozens of countries; it has also been an opportunity for gloating from the governments of America’s foes and rivals, and has been an embarrassment for its friends and allies.

This past weekend saw hundreds of protests not just in America, but around the world. On Saturday in Parliament Square in London, the largest of many demonstrations in Britain, tens of thousands of people braved chilly squalls and the risk of covid-19, which had led government ministers to call for protests to be shunned. They shouted Mr Floyd’s name, chanted “Black Lives Matter” and, every now and then, dropped to one knee with one clenched fist raised skyward. The crowd, overwhelmingly young and racially mixed, mostly wore masks but paid no attention to social-distancing constraints. Many regarded the danger posed by the virus as proof of their commitment to the anti-racist cause. Their parents or grandparents might have been hurt or arrested in the battle outside the American embassy that followed a protest against the Vietnam war in March 1968. But they too, in their own eyes at least, were putting themselves on the line.

They were protesting against not just violence by the American police, or President Donald Trump’s handling of the unrest, but against racism at home. Many placards listed names of black victims of police violence in Britain, such as Mark Duggan, a 29-year-old whose shooting by the police in London in 2011 sparked widespread rioting. They also recalled the victims of other crimes whose perpetrators had not been brought to justice, such as Belly Mujinga, a railway worker who died of covid-19, allegedly after being spat at by a carrier of the virus.

In other countries, too, George Floyd’s murder has resurrected old worries about the justice system’s treatment of ethnic minorities. In France, for example, protesters remembered Adama Traoré, a young Frenchman of Malian descent who died in police custody in 2016. And Brazil on Sunday saw nationwide marches against President Jair Bolsonaro and police violence against black people, including the accidental killing of a 14-year-old in Rio de Janeiro on May 18th.

Elsewhere representatives of entire communities have drawn parallels between their plight and that of African-Americans. Palestinians saw echoes of George Floyd’s fate in the shooting by police in Jerusalem on May 30th of Iyad Halak, a 32-year-old with severe autism, who was apparently mistaken for somebody else. In Australia, Aboriginal activists pointed out that more than 400 indigenous people have died in police custody since 1991, when a commission of inquiry, held to investigate the problem, made hundreds of recommendations to promote reconciliation between Aboriginal and other Australians. The “Black Lives Matter” slogan has been adopted in Indonesia by indigenous people in the provinces of Papua and West Papua. Darker-skinned than many Indonesians, many Papuans complain of widespread discrimination, and hanker after independence.

That no country is entirely free of racism and discrimination may have restrained some politicians from commenting on America’s problems. Its strongest critics, however, showed no such reticence. After all, American leaders rarely pull their punches.

China in particular relished accusing America of hypocrisy. The timing was poignant. On May 28th China’s parliament rubber-stamped a proposal to impose a security law on Hong Kong that America insisted robbed the territory of the autonomy it was promised. June 4th marked the anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre in 1989. Mike Pompeo, America’s secretary of state, undeterred by the irony that America now appeared far more likely than China to deploy armoured vehicles against peaceful protesters in its national capital, observed the date by meeting veterans of China’s democracy movement. Hu Xijin, editor of Global Times, a tub-thumping party-controlled tabloid, clearly enjoyed drawing attention to these coincidences. On Twitter, he called on Mr Pompeo to “stand with the angry people of Minneapolis, just like you did with people of Hong Kong”.

Iran’s leaders have been milking America’s predicament for all it is worth. “A cop kneeling on a black man’s neck and letting him choke to death...is the nature of the American government. They have done the same to such countries as Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria," said Ayatollah Khamenei, the country’s supreme leader, in a televised speech. Authoritarian leaders elsewhere—in Russia and Turkey, for example—have similarly jumped to criticise America, and, by implication, try to vindicate their own repression. Even North Korea, by many assessments the world’s most thuggish and despotic regime, tried to seize the moral high ground. “Demonstrators enraged by the extreme racists throng even to the White House. This is the reality in the US today,” claimed a spokesman quoted in the ruling-party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun.

America’s friends and allies, by contrast, have found themselves in a tight spot. Few want to antagonise America, or Mr Trump. So many have sought refuge in keeping their mouths shut. Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, for example, has been uncharacteristically taciturn on the issue. And Justin Trudeau, his Canadian counterpart, responded to a question about Mr Trump’s handling of recent events with more than 20 seconds of eloquent silence, before beginning his answer: “We all watch in horror and consternation what’s going on in the United States...”, before turning to racism and inequality in Canada.

On the other hand, the pressure from the streets means that Western leaders cannot ignore racism either in America or at home. A young generation for whom this has become, along with climate change and sexual inequality, one of the big political issues will force an examination of many national blindspots. In the British port city of Bristol, for example, protesters toppled a statue of Edward Colston, a 17th-century slave-trader, and heaved it into a canal. And in the Netherlands, the prime minister, Mark Rutte, said he had changed his mind about his previous defence of the “Zwarte Piet” tradition cherished by many Dutch people: when Santa Claus visits the country each December, he is accompanied by “black Petes”, helpers played by children or adults dressed up in blackface, big red lips and curly wigs.

The pandemic has marked a pause in the wave of unco-ordinated but simultaneous protest movements that crossed much of the world last year. They seem to be resuming, starting in America. Its position as the sole superpower may be under threat. But its political agonies still sway opinion around the world.■||1

2020-06-08||Despite being a far less mobile population, immigrants never seem to be able to leave behind the mantle of “foreigner.” Right-wing advocates, based on little but poorly-disguised racism, use pandemics and other disruptions to the international order (like terror attacks) as evidence of the dangers of immigration. Their narratives disregard that immigrants overwhelmingly make up a country’s essential workforce. Such fear-mongering escalates xenophobia already percolating in society. Popular media and political discourse link immigrants to dangers unfolding in faraway lands, highlighting the “foreign-ness” of immigrants and their descendants. Immigrants consequently become depicted as internal threats. This holds true even when immigrants are not from or have never visited the places where the threats originate (I expound on this subject in my book Here, There, and Elsewhere: The Making of Immigrant Identities in a Globalized World).

Many segments of the American public blamed Latinos for Zika, and African immigrants for Ebola, regardless of which South American or African countries the immigrants came from. Today, the COVID-19 crisis, having originated in China, is feeding into pre-existing anti-Chinese racism. This is despite the fact that the virus that led to the outbreak in New York, which has the largest U.S. death toll, came from Europe. Hate-crimes against those perceived as Chinese has similarly risen in Canada.||1

Targeting policy responses to Covid- 19 appropriately is important but requires information such as which groups in society are most affected by the pandemic. This column uses data on Covid-19 infections and mortality for small local areas in England and Wales to study the link of Covid-19 with socioeconomic factors. The findings suggest that areas with larger households, worse levels of self-reported health and a larger fraction of people using public transport have higher infection rates. Areas with an older population, a larger black or Asian population and worse levels of self-reported health have higher mortality rates. Particular attention should hence be paid to reducing the risk of infection on public transport when relaxing lockdown measures.

There is wide variation in Covid-19 infection rates and mortality rates across England and Wales. The local authority with the highest infection rate in early May 2020 was Barrow-in-Furness in the northwest, with over 800 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people. Nearby Lancaster and South Lakeland as well as the North East region around Gateshead, Sunderland and South Tyneside were further hotspots. Wales also has very high infection rates, but this is mostly due to a higher frequency of testing compared to England.

The picture is different for mortality rates. As of 24 April 2020, the local authority with the highest mortality rate was Hertsmere in Hertfordshire, with 131 deaths per 100,000 people. The neighbouring north London boroughs of Harrow, Barnet and Enfield also had high mortality rates. Out of the 10 local authorities with the highest mortality, six are in Greater London.

Source: Author’s calculations using data on the number of deaths that mention Covid-19 on the death certificate from the ONS weekly deaths dataset up to 24 April 2020.

Health, ethnicity, household size and use of public transport matter

Two studies for New York City (Borjas 2020, Almagro and Orane-Hutchinson 2020) examine the correlation between Covid-19 infections and socioeconomic variables and find that infection rates are higher in zip codes with a larger black population, with on average larger households and with more people working in occupations with a high degree of human interaction.

I use simple correlation and regression analysis to examine this question in England and Wales, looking not only at infections but also at mortality (Sá 2020). Data on the number of deaths that mention Covid-19 on the death certificate are available from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) at a fine level of geographic disaggregation (over 7,000 Middle Layer Super Output Areas). This allows me to include local authority fixed effects in the analysis, capturing local characteristics that have not been included in the model. I find that local areas that have larger households, worse levels of self-reported health and a larger fraction of people using public transport have more Covid-19 infections per 100,000 people. For mortality, household size and use of public transport are less important, but there is a clear relation with age, ethnicity and self-reported health. Local areas with an older population, a larger black or Asian population and worse levels of self-reported health have more Covid-19 deaths per 100,000 people.

Some of these socioeconomic factors were highlighted by Aron and Muellbauer (2020), who note that the number of excess deaths in London – measured as the number of deaths relative to the average number of deaths in the same period in the past five years – increased ahead of other regions, probably due to high population density and a crowded public transport system which make it difficult to social distance. Overman (2020) points out that the economic impacts of Covid-19 are likely to be unequal across different areas of the UK, affecting especially areas where workers cannot easily work from home.

The relation between self-reported health and infections and mortality suggests that encouraging a healthy lifestyle can help prevent the spread of infections and reduce mortality. Also, as many countries now begin to relax lockdown measures, policymakers should pay particular attention to reducing the risk of infection in public transport. This can be done by encouraging people to use other forms of transport, as is being done in the UK, but also by increasing the frequency of services to avoid overcrowding. Businesses should also take the risk of infection in public transport into account when deciding how to get their employees back to the office. Working from home should continue to be encouraged when possible, especially for those who have to travel to work by public transport. This is particularly relevant in London, where more than half of employed workers travel to work by public transport, compared with a national average of 13%.

2020-06-08||Contact-tracing and risk-tracing technologies could help ease the ‘health–wealth trade-off’ confronting many countries in the wake of COVID-19. But privacy and security concerns are preventing such technologies from being widely adopted. This column suggests a way to ease those concerns by endowing individuals with property rights to the digital information that concerns them. A ‘self-sovereign identity system’ could assure users that their data would be exploited only for specified purposes, such as containing a pandemic. The data would revert to being private property once the pandemic is over.

At present, countries around the world face a terrible trade-off between a health crisis and an economic crisis, which can be called the ‘health–wealth trade-off’. To avoid the health crisis, many countries have implemented lockdowns, which generate an enormous economic cost in terms of lost income and output (e.g. Portes 2020). This trade-off could be eased substantially through contact tracing, risk tracing, testing, isolating, and treatment.

‘Contact tracing’ involves identifying people who may have come into contact, directly or indirectly, with an infected person. The contacts of infected people can then be tested for infection; those infected can be isolated and treated; their contacts can be traced, and so on (Galeotti et al. 2020). Implementing contact-tracing would greatly reduce the need for social distancing, particularly if contact-tracing were supplemented by ‘risk tracing’, which involves dividing people into risk categories on the basis of readily available information, such as age, occupation, residence, workplace, and pre-existing health conditions (Mesnard and Seabright 2020). The effectiveness of contact- and risk-tracing can be enhanced significantly through the application of AI technologies in areas such as early warnings, tracking and prediction, visualisation, diagnosis and prognosis, monitoring crowds, and treatment support (e.g. Vaishya et al. 2020).

If AI-enhanced contact and risk tracing were implemented, social distancing would be necessary primarily for people who have not been tested and are in high-risk categories. Consequently, the health–wealth trade-off would be vastly improved because it would no longer be necessary for countries to send most of their residents into lockdown. Many people would return to work, with social distancing regulations becoming more stringent for the more vulnerable groups.

For countries where contact and risk tracing is feasible, people are generally willing to provide the requisite data in return for protection from infection, with three provisos: that others do the same, that their data are used only for the purpose of containing the pandemic, and that their data are adequately protected from hacking and malicious use. The great interest in providing data in return for health security is exemplified by the widespread attention and positive response PwC has received for its plans to deploy an Automatic Contact Tracing check-in app for its employees, also to be made available to its clients (e.g. Leswing 2020).1 Other companies, such as Locix and Microshare, are working on tools permitting not only people but the surfaces with which infected people have come into contact to be retraced. Such initiatives will help companies reopen operations after lockdown by ensuring employees’ workplace safety. Though contact tracing at the workplace is certainly welcome, it is far less effective than systems providing comprehensive contact tracing throughout time and space.

In order for contact and risk tracing to become manageable in countries with significant infection rates, it needs to be done automatically through digital technologies rather than through personal interviews. Apple and Google have partnered to assist in contact-tracing through a system that includes application programming interfaces (APIs) and operating system-level technology. These companies also plan to offer a Bluetooth-based contact-tracing platform “that would allow more individuals to participate, if they choose to opt in, as well as enable interaction with a broader ecosystem of apps and government health authorities” (Government Technology 2020). The opt-in condition is meant to overcome privacy and security concerns. As Apple and Google emphasise, “privacy, transparency and consent are of utmost importance in this effort” (Apple 2020).

But the opt-in condition is expected to limit severely the uptake of this system.2 Opt-in policies produce far lower participation rates than opt-out policies in a wide variety of settings, from organ donations to pensions. This is so for a variety of well-known reasons: changing the default requires mental effort; the default is usually considered the preferable or acceptable choice; and people are more sensitive to losses than to gains relative to the default, making them more likely to retain the default. Governments and businesses are increasingly using opt-out design to promote socially desirable outcomes in many domains though not, as noted, in pandemic containment (e.g. Johnson and Goldstein 2003, Sunstein 2017, Thaler and Sunstein 2008).

Needless to say, contact tracing software is effective only when it is widely deployed. The system only has a high chance of detecting when a person in the system has been in contact with an infected person if a large proportion of the population has signal-emitting devices. Thus, the Apple-Google contact-tracing system is widely deemed unlikely to play a major role in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic in many Western countries.

The opt-in policy of Apple and Google with respect to their contact-tracing app stands in stark contrast to their standard policy with regard to the use of private data for advertising purposes, as well as derivative digital strategies designed to attract user attention. In practice, smartphones can be understood as surveillance devices, used by digital network providers (such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and others) to target advertising individually to users. These users implicitly consent to this surveillance by agreeing to the digital services’ terms and conditions, which they rarely attempt to read and which they would be unable to read (with all hyperlinks to other relevant documents) even if they wished to, due to the time and effort required.3 In some cases, users have the possibility of opting out of some surveillance, but often in return for significant loss of service.

Currently, most people are highly sensitive to the potential misuse of their data with regard to contact tracing, but remain largely unaware that their smartphones are de facto surveillance devices for advertising and attention-capturing purposes. Since the digital network providers earn their incomes from pursuing these purposes, they have a natural incentive to keep this asymmetric awareness intact. Apple, Google, and other digital network providers’ sensitivity to privacy and security concerns in contact tracing is understandable.

Because policymakers are often afflicted with the same asymmetric awareness, or are unwilling to address the problem of surveillance for advertising openly, the central questions concerning the future of contact and risk tracing are never asked. How can users be given the opportunity to share information for containing the pandemic while safeguarding their privacy and security? Can the degree of surveillance that is standard for advertising also be applied to saving lives?

To address these questions productively, we need to think beyond the existing institutional framework. The critical insight is simple: the current obstacles to trustworthy information sharing arise from a fundamental misallocation of digital property rights. In the current digital world, users generally do not have property rights to the data about them, not even to the data that they generate about themselves. This data usually belongs to digital network providers, such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. Users are free to leave these networks, but information about users remains in the hands of the networks.4

In the absence of individual digital property rights, it is not surprising that users are highly concerned about the privacy and security of their data. Living in a world in which much of the data about themselves are not in their own hands, they are understandably worried about the possibility of making these data available to a new set of decision makers, including government agencies fighting the pandemic. After all, it is difficult to assure them that data which do not belong to them will not be used by third parties for other purposes.

The straightforward way of tackling this problem is to give users residual property rights to the digital information about them. This solution is feasible and implementable. People can be made ‘sovereign’ over their digital identities (i.e. the information representing them) by implementing a ‘self-sovereign identity system’ whose properties have been well-explored (Der et al. 2017, Tobin and Reed 2017; the economic implications of a self-sovereign identity system are described in Snower 2018). In such a system, each person is given a private digital key to certified, encrypted data about himself or herself for a potentially unlimited number of recipients who can access the data, provided that they have the corresponding public key. The system can be implemented through distributed ledger applications (such as blockchain) and smart contracts (e.g. Jacobovitz 2016, Meitinger 2017). These applications permit search for decentralised identifiers without centralised directory, so that data can be authenticated with decentralised, verifiable credentials. Digital identities need to be persistent, portable, interoperable, and secure (see Allen 2016 for a more detailed description of these requirements). Then each person can choose what inf||0
2020-06-08||The D3.js visualization library can be used for creating beautiful graphs and visualizations using data from external sources including CSV files and JSON data.

To give you an example, this D3.js animation inside the Google Sheets associated with the COVID-19 tracker project visualizes the growth of Coronavirus cases in India over time. It uses the Google Visualization API, D3.js and the very-awesome Bar Chart Race component built by Mike Bostock, the creator of D3.js.

This guide explains how you can use data in your Google Spreadsheets to create charts with D3.js using the Visualization API. The data is fetched in real-time so if the data in your Google Sheets is updated, it is reflected in the graph as well.

Make your Google Spreadsheet public - you can either share the sheet with “anyone who has the link can view” access or make it public so even search engines that find your sheet that has the Charts data.

We are using this Google Sheet for this tutorial.

Load the D3.js (v5) and the Google charts library in your index.html file. The JavaScript for rendering the D3 chart is written in the index.js file.

Here specify the URL of your publish Google Spreadsheet (the gid should point to the sheet that has the data). The Google Visualization API Query Language (reference) lets you use SQL like syntax to specify columns that should be used for fetching data from the Google sheet. You can also use , and clauses to limit the data that is returned by Google Sheets.

After the spreadsheet data is available, manipulate the response in an Array of Objects that can be read by d3.js. Google Sheets returns numerical data as String so we can either use parseInt or the Unary (+) operator to convert the String to Integer.

Next, we create a Bar Chart in D3.js using the data from Google Sheets. You may follow this tutorial on @ObservableHQ to understand how to make bar charts inside D3.js. The chart is rendered in SVG.||2
2020-06-08||The German administration has just released their €130 billion economic stimulus package, the most prominent measure of which is an unconventional fiscal policy in the form of a sudden drop in VAT. The aim is to create a future path of increasing sales taxes by increasing prices and hence stimulating inflation expectations and aggregate demand today. This column argues that earlier episodes have shown that unconventional policy is effective because it is easily understood by non-expert households and households react to it strongly. Alternative unconventional measures, instead, such as forward guidance, are largely ineffective in part because households do not understand what such policies imply for their consumption.

As many economies are planning a slow reopening after the COVID-19 containment measures, the question of how to jumpstart the economy and stimulate aggregate demand has taken centre stage (Furman 2020). When conventional monetary policy is constrained and high debt burdens limit the scope of conventional fiscal policy, unconventional policies enter the policy toolbox.

On 3 June 2020, the German government released the measures that will constitute an unprecedented €130 billion stimulus plan. The most unexpected and prominent measure is a form of unconventional fiscal policy (Feldstein 2002, D’Acunto et al. 2016, 2018), whereby the government changes VAT rates to create a future path of increasing sales taxes and hence stimulate inflation expectations and spending at impact. Germany will implement an unexpected, sudden, and temporary drop in VAT, starting in July 2020 until the end of 2020, which will increase households’ expected inflation for 2021 and hence should stimulate spending for the rest of 2020, until prices increase again. The same exact effect could also be obtained by pre-announcing a future increase in VAT, without first cutting the tax. Both measures incentivise households to move their spending forward as long as VAT is lower, although the measures differ in terms of implications for government budgets.

Unconventional fiscal policy is part of a set of non-conventional policies designed and implemented to tackle the main conundrum of the euro area since the Great Recession: stimulating inflation expectations and ultimately aggregate demand in a setting in which traditional monetary policy measures are not viable, and governments can barely support growth with fiscal spending because of their large debt-to-GDP ratios. Another popular unconventional policy that has entered the standard toolbox of many central banks is forward guidance – central banks’ explicit commitment to keep interest rates low until after the end of a liquidity trap, which will generate inflation then and hence should increase inflation expectations today.

In theory, unconventional fiscal policy and forward guidance act through the same channels. They both aim to increase households’ inflation expectations in times in which the effective lower bound on nominal rates binds, and hence changes in inflation expectations should translate one-to-one into changes in perceived real rates by households. Because households perceive lower real interest rates, their incentives to save decline and their willingness to consume should increase based on the consumer Euler equation. These channels are unconventional in the sense that policymakers aim to manage households’ behaviour directly, as opposed to changing the incentives of financial intermediaries and firms and transmitting policy measures indirectly to households.

Despite the same theoretical channels, in the aggregate, forward guidance seems to have been ineffective (Del Negro et al. 2015), and only scant evidence exists to assess the effectiveness of unconventional fiscal policy (D’Acunto et al. 2019). Given the prominence of these measures to jump start the economy after the COVID-19 crisis, in this column, we discuss whether any of these policies appears to have been successful using the same identical microdata and surveys for both policy measures.

Figure 1 reports the central findings in D’Acunto et al. (2020) using data from the harmonised European Commission Consumer Confidence survey for Germany. The figure compares German households’ reaction to a measure of unconventional fiscal policy in 2005 and two forward guidance announcements in 2013-2014.

Figure 1 Inflation expectations and readiness to spend on durables: German households

The top panels report the fraction of the German population expecting higher inflation over the following 12 months; the bottom panels report their average willingness to purchase durable goods. The left panels plot these measures for the unconventional fiscal policy episode. In November 2005, the German government unexpectedly announced a rise in VAT from 16% to 19%, but the increase was only effective in January 2007 and hence, the government engineered a path of future price increases. The right panels plot these measures for the first two explicit forward guidance announcements by former ECB President Draghi in July 2013 and January 2014.

Although theoretically both policies should raise households' inflation expectations and spending on impact, only unconventional fiscal policy has produced these outcomes in the micro data. Forward guidance announcements do not appear to manage expectations or spending plans. The raw data time-series evidence in Figure 1 is interesting, but any unobserved shock contemporaneous to the policy announcements could explain those dynamics.

Methodologically, we need a scientific approach that helps reduce the endogeneity concerns inherent to these policy measures. We propose an identification strategy in the spirit of Poterba (1996), in which other EU consumers not exposed directly to the German VAT shock and/or to the ECB measures of forward guidance act as counterfactual for the behaviour of Germans had the policy announcements not happened. Because different households with different demographics react differently to changes in inflation expectations (Bachmann et al. 2015), we match German households to similar foreign households based on observables. Moreover, our data allow us to control directly for important determinants of spending plans, such as households' income expectations, financial outlook, employment status, and housing choices.

Figure 2 plots the average treatment effect (ATE) of the unconventional fiscal policy announcement on durable purchases (top panel) and of forward guidance (bottom panel). We find no differences in the readiness to spend on durable goods between German and matched households before the announcement of the VAT change. Starting in December 2005, after the future VAT change was announced, German households' willingness to spend increased relative to matched households: German households were 3.8 percentage points more likely to declare it was a good time to purchase durable goods after the announcement relative to before and to matched foreign households. The effect increased in magnitude throughout 2006 and peaked at 34 percentage points in November 2006. The average treatment effect dropped to zero in January 2007 once the VAT increased and higher inflation materialised.

For forward guidance, instead, we find no difference in the readiness to spend on durable goods between German and matched households before the first forward guidance announcement in July 2013. Germans' propensity to spend did not change after the first forward guidance announcement relative to before and relative to matched foreign households. Even around the second announcement in January 2014, the announcement had no effect on the willingness to spend. The propensity to spend did not move after the second announcement either. Ultimately, forward guidance announcements had no effect on impact nor delayed indirect effects through financial intermediaries, such as due to an effect of lower long-term interest rates on credit-financed consumption.

Given the novelty of unconventional fiscal policy, we now discuss in more detail its features and intellectual background. Feldstein (2002) introduced the notion of unconventional fiscal policy measures at times of liquidity traps. Among several possible interventions, he proposed a series of pre-announced increases in VAT to generate consumer price inflation, and hence increase private spending via intertemporal substitution. In his words: “This [VAT] tax-induced inflation would give households an incentive to spend sooner rather than waiting until prices are substantially higher.” The intuition for this proposal is based on a simple logic: announcing higher prices in the future – either with a sudden but temporary cut, or with an outright future increase in VAT – will increase current inflation expectations. Higher inflation expectations at times of fixed nominal interest rates should reduce real interest rates (Fisher equation), and lower real interest rates should increase households’ incentives to consume rather than save (Euler equation). Because imposing higher VAT reduces households’ wealth (especially poorer households’ wealth) and might affect households’ labour supply, lower income taxes (or transfers to those households that do not pay any income tax) should accompany the increase in VAT.

Designing such a measure with a sudden but temporary VAT cut with a pre-specified date in which the VAT will revert back to its original level is exactly what the German administration announced as part of their €130 billion stimulus package. A pre-announced tax increase and a sudden temporary drop in VAT differ in terms of budget neutrality: the former policy is budget neutral for the government if paired with income tax cut or even generates revenues, whereas the latter policy creates budget deficits. In both cases, unconventional fiscal policy incentivises households to consume immediately, jump-tart the economy, and hence help the economy ||0
2020-06-08||Face coverings may have the order of the day at Foxboro High School’s 145th commencement exercises on Sunday — at least for everyone but graduates and their immediate families.

But even the personal protective equipment worn by faculty, administrators and support staff couldn’t mask the pride displayed for members of the Class of 2020 who reveled in the school’s first-ever drive-thru graduation.

The hybrid ceremony was planned by school and public safety officials to minimize health risks and comply with state guidelines stemming from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Assembling at the Ahern Middle School according to a staggered schedule designed to promote social distancing, students and family members were escorted to the high school in groups of 40 vehicles, according to Police Chief Michael Grace.

“This is very festive,” Grace said. “Everyone has been great about adhering to the restrictions.”

Once arriving at the high school, vehicles queued up in the driveway loop and awaited their turn to pull up at a makeshift stage erected in front of the main office. One by one, class members were personally greeted by Principal Diana Myers-Pachla before mounting the stage to retrieve their diploma — then pausing as the family paparazzi snapped away.

Although some had lamented missing the pomp and circumstance typically associated with a conventional graduation, feeling they were shortchanged by history, local families clearly embraced the novelty of Sunday’s drive-thru format — celebrating the milestone by outfitting cars with balloons, ribbons and other creative decorations.

The unusual format also afforded graduates an opportunity to make impromptu statements before the TV cameras — with many taking advantage of their face time.

“I would just like to thank my parents, my best friends and my teachers for helping me through these four years of high school,” said graduate Alexya Eliopoulos while family members stood outside their car snapping photos.

“A shout out to my family and all of my friends and all of my teachers for helping make this happen,” Fawaz said. “Love you guys.”

Commencement speeches and other remarks typically delivered at graduation were recorded in advance and will be broadcast on Foxboro Cable Access.

In those remarks, class President Sam Belanger suggested that commencement marks a beginning not an end, and voiced confidence that this year’s graduates will make an impact in myriad ways.

“I regret that I am unable to deliver this message in person,” he added. “The circumstances that we are facing are unfortunate. But it is important to keep perspective.”

In conclusion, Belanger counseled classmates to keep a positive attitude and live every day to its fullest.

“We are living in the richest country in the history of the world with opportunity at our fingertips for all of us,” he said. “We’re strong and resilient as a class and we will bounce back from this to accomplish great things. Stay positive and stay strong.”

In her remarks, class Valedictorian Amy Traianou characterized 2020 as “the year that just keeps getting weirder.”

“We may have lost the last couple months of our senior year, but the last three months don’t take away from the four years it took to get here,” she said. “We worked hard and we should be proud of ourselves.”||2
2020-06-08||The easing of restrictions brought in to contain the spread of Covid-19 has been accelerated with what has been termed "Phase 2+" beginning today, here's what you need to know about the changes.

Everything outlined in Phase 2 has been given the green light while some of Phase 3 has been brought forward.

Stay Local: You may travel within your own county, and up to 20 kilometres from your home if crossing county boundaries.

Meeting other people: You may meet up to six people from outside your household both indoors and outdoors for social gatherings.

Sports: Organised outdoor exercise, sporting, cultural or social activities of up to 15 people may take place. Behind-closed-door horse and greyhound racing can commence. Elite athletes may return to their training facilities.

The Irish Greyhound Board said it has arranged for a "comprehensive schedule" of greyhound trials to commence on 8 June at all 14 greyhound tracks with the intention of returning to racing behind closed doors early in the week commencing 15 June.

Shops: Most retailers are reopening - but not all. Penneys will not begin reopening stores until 12 June. Shopping centres can only reopen from 15 June. Opening times will be staggered. Shopping centres must take measures to ensure people do not congregate at benches, fountains or food courts.

Transport: Walk or cycle if you can. Only use public transport if you absolutely need to.

Masks: It is recommenced that face coverings be worn in public places, such as shops, and on public transport.

Funerals: Up to 25 immediate family and close friends may attend funeral services.

Children: Outdoor summer camps may operate for post-primary children in groups of no more than 15. Playgrounds and commercially-serviced outdoor amenities may also reopen. However, Dublin City Council said it does not operate supervised playgrounds and pending further clarification, its playgrounds will not reopen from Monday.

There will be a new Summer Education Programme for children with special educational needs and disadvantaged children. Minister for Education joe McHugh will bring proposals to Government on this next week.

Work: The advice remains to work from home where possible. The Return to Work Safely Protocol is the operative guide for employers and employees. Marts may open where social distancing and hygiene can be maintained.

Read all about it: Public libraries will commence reopening.

International travel: All non-essential overseas travel to and from Ireland should be avoided. Passengers arriving from overseas are expected to self-isolate for 14 days.

Advice for cocooners: If you are over 70 or medically vulnerable, continue to stay home as much as possible. You may welcome small numbers of people to your home, but maintain social distancing. When out shopping, you are advised to use the times specially allotted by retailers. If you are visiting someone who is over 70 or medically vulnerable, be extra-vigilant.

Two metre social distancing: This remains the public health advice.

Nursing homes: Limited nursing home visits will be allowed from 15 June under certain circumstances.

Drinking and eating: Bars (with or without restaurant licences, as long as they serve food) can reopen with table service only and restaurants will reopen alongside hotels. The Taoiseach said detailed guidance will be published next week for hotels, bars, restaurants.

Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan, when asked if people had to eat a meal if they were going to be in a pub, said that "a few fellas getting together for a few pints and having a packet of peanuts" does not constitute a meal in a restaurant.

He said people had to be sensible and not congregate at a bar, they had to sit down and be served. Dr Holohan said most Irish people know the difference between a restaurant and a pub and he felt they would be sensible.

Health: Minister Simon Harris says there will be a "clear timeline" on resumption of screening programmes expected by the end of June.

Tourism: Hotels, hostels, caravan parks, galleries and museums will welcome visitors again.

Travel: All restrictions for travelling within Ireland will be lifted. There is no date set yet for people to be allowed travel abroad again. Mr Varadkar said he would not encourage anyone to book flights.

Hair salons/barbers: At present, they remain in the Phase 4 stage (20 July).

Weddings: There is no decision yet as to if they can be held in Phase 3 or 4 and the numbers that will be allowed to attend.

Religious services: People can attend services at places of worship from the beginning of Phase 3, with physical distancing measures in place. Catholic Archbishop Diarmuid Martin said "this will be a consolation to many people and preparations will be intensified to ensure this can be done safely".

Dr Martin also said that communions and confirmations in small groups may now be able to take place later in the summer.

Childcare: Crèches, childminders and preschools will open for children of all workers who need childcare to return to work. However, where capacity is limited, preference will be give to children of frontline workers. Children will be grouped into pods, of between six and 12, to reduce the risk of transmitting coronavirus.

Phase 4 (20 July) - this is now the final phase

Hair salons/barbers: At present, they will not reopen until this phase.

All bars back: Pubs that do not serve food can reopen. However, Brian Foley from the Vintners' Federation of Ireland has warned that many will remain shut if the two metre social distancing advice remains. "This is because it would reduce capacity by up to 87% of standing customers and 65% of those seated in a typical bar layout. So it would simply not be viable for many pubs to run a business."

Socialising: A slightly larger number of people - the exact number yet to be decided - may visit another household for a short period of time while maintaining social distancing. Small social (non-family) gatherings will be allowed but will be limited to a maximum number of participants.

Culture/recreation: Theatres and cinemas can reopen with social distancing in place. Indoor recreational venues, such as bowling alleys and bingo halls, will also open their doors.

Work: There will be a phased return to work across all sectors. Employees who cannot work remotely will be the first to return to onsite working. Depending on the business, measures such as shift work and staggered hours will be implemented. Remote working will continue for those who can do so.

Sport: Close physical contact sports, such as rugby and boxing, can resume. Gyms, dance studios and sports clubs can reopen alongside effective cleaning and social distancing.

Spectators can begin to attend live sporting events only in accordance with both indoor and outdoor number restrictions and where social distancing can be complied with.

Larger gatherings: Some larger social gatherings can take place (for example, weddings). But these will be restricted due to the risks involved.||0
2020-06-08||This post really is off-topic.

It seemed that 2020 started to get a good year. Life was kind of normal and I was looking forward to the upcoming events. Community events as well as family events. I was really looking forward to the MVP Summit 2020, to meeting good friends again and to visit my favorite city in the US.

But life wouldn't be life if there were no changes and challenges.

February 1st was the end of my old life but the start of a new one. A challenging one and a life full of new chances and opportunities.

My wife and I, we broke up. Without any drama and stuff like this. It was a kind of spontaneous decision but a needed one. It was unexpected for our family and friends but we kind of knew about this for the last three years. It was a shock for the kids for sure but, as I said, there was never any drama and we are still friends and are talking and laughing together. The shock for the kids was a small one and a short one. Actually nothing really changed for the kids, except living in two houses which for sure is a huge change but they seem to love it, to enjoy it like a kind of adventure. Every house has other things they like, other rules and it seems they love to live in both houses.

This might also be shocking for friends who are reading this right now.

To leave the wife that was on my side for around 16 years felt strange and odd. But at the end it was a good decision for both of us.

This for sure results in new challenging situations, like moving into a new apartment and stuff like this.

What else did change?

The second challenging situation is the one that happens to all of us all over the world. The COVID-19 lockdowns all over the world are challenging for everyone. Especially the kids and their parents. Fortunately, I am able to work from home and, fortunately, child care is divided 50/50 between me and my wife. (She is still called my wife because we are still married.) But to work and to do home-schooling and child care in parallel is different, challenging and might be really hard and almost impossible for some parents.

Since COVID-19 happened to central Europe, I was working from home. Actually, today is the first day since weeks I commute to work. Feels strange sitting in the train, for more than one hour, and wearing a face mask. The train is almost empty. Only a few people are talking because of those annoying masks.

And, the first time since months, I have some time to write a blog post. I used to write while commuting, so I took the chance to write some stuff.

What comes next?

The new situation and the less commute time are the reasons why I didn't write a blog post ore something else since January.

The move to the new apartment is done. The kids know the new situation since more than a month and get used to it. It is all settling and calming down and the numbers around COVID-19 are getting better and better in central Europe. Let's have a small look into the future:

I'm going to start challenging myself again to do some more stuff for the developer community:
• Writing a blog post at least every second week
• Just ask for topics.
• Rewriting my book to update it to ASP.NET Core 5.0 and really, really, really get it published
• Writing some more technical articles for my favorite magazine.
• Trying to do some talks on conferences and user groups
• The next planned talk is at the DWX in November this year
• Getting my streaming set up and running in the new apartment and start streaming again
• The bandwidth could be a problem in the new apartment.
• But just recording and feed a YouTube channel could be an option, too.

Actually, this is kind of challenging but why not? I really love challenges :-)||2
2020-06-09||From trade-offs to synergies: COVID-19, populism, and sustainable development

Concerns are growing that the COVID-19 crisis could be exploited by populists claiming to be the voice of those who have been ‘left behind’. This column presents a new framework which could help shed light on the relationship between sustainable development and populism. Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals may be associated with diminishing electoral support for populism, but humanity must still get better at turning the trade-offs between SDGs into synergies. During the COVID-19 recovery, an effective way to prevent populists from exploiting the crisis may involve making the SDGs the policy blueprint.

This column is a lead commentary in the VoxEU debate on "Populism"

In the academic literature, as well as within the VoxEU debate, a number of reasons for the recent rise of populism have been brought forward (for an overview of the literature, see Norris and Inglehart 2018). However, no study has yet looked systematically at the relationship between the rise of populism on the one hand, and the historic Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development on the other. To address this gap, we recently introduced the first systematic classification of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) performance and populism (Kroll and Zipperer 2020). We performed the first empirical analysis of the relationship between populism and the SDGs by examining how countries have progressed on the SDGs over time, and how their development in terms of sustainability relates to subsequent electoral support for populism. We used data from the SDG Index and Dashboards (Sachs et al. 2019 and www.sdgindex.org) which provides “the most comprehensive picture of national progress on the SDGs and offers a useful synthesis of what has been achieved so far” (Nature Sustainability 2018).

The SDGs provide a new and enlarged understanding of sustainability as an economic, social, and environmental challenge. The goals are firmly rooted in the concept of sustainable development, i.e. “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (Brundtland Commission 1987, Sachs 2015). They comprise 17 goals and 169 targets that span a range of topics, from ending extreme poverty (SDG 1) to affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), or a global partnership for the goals (SDG 17) (UN 2015) (see Figure 1).

What makes pursuing the SDGs a particularly challenging task is the fact that these goals have, at present, antagonist tendencies among themselves. In other words, there are numerous trade-offs between SDGs, such as between reducing poverty and climate action, which, in the future, will need to be turned into mutually reinforcing synergies in order to achieve a “virtuous cycle of SDG progress” (Kroll et al. 2019). Colleagues and I have performed a first analysis of future interactions for projected SDG trends until 2030 within and between goals. We analysed how trade-offs and synergies have evolved globally in the recent past. We found an alarming inability to overcome certain persistent trade-offs, as well as the deterioration for some SDGs. These findings seriously threaten the achievement of the Agenda 2030 (ibid).

In order to enable a structured and fine-grained interpretation of the nexus between sustainability and populism in future research and policy debate, we have recently proposed a Sustainability–Populism Framework (Kroll and Zipperer 2020, see Figures 2 and 3). It elaborates on the four possible outcomes for the relationship between SDG performance over time, and subsequent electoral support for populism.
• Quadrant I: “disillusioned performers” (SDG improvement, rising populism). The countries named “disillusioned performers” have been making progress towards the SDGs. However, populist parties were able to gather increased support (e.g. by capitalising on potential fear of regress or scapegoating towards minorities).
• Quadrant II: “failing prey (to populists)” (SDG deterioration, rising populism). Countries in this category have been failing to advance on the SDGs, and they are falling prey to populists and the political recipes they propose.
• Quadrant III: “resilient believers (in liberal democracy)” (SDG deterioration, falling populism). Even though the situation with regard to the SDGs has deteriorated over the last years, countries in this group keep their faith in traditional mainstream parties and the solutions they propose to overcome the challenges.
• Quadrant IV: “consolidating achievers” (SDG improvement, falling populism). These countries have been making progress towards the SDGs, and the calls by populists to steer in a different direction are not heeded by voters.

The SDGs as an answer to populism

For illustrative purposes of the framework’s analytical value, we examined data on SDG progress and populist vote shares that were available for 39 countries (SDG progress data for 2010 – 2015). Although, due to a time lag, the raw data sometimes precede that period; populist vote share data represent the change from second-last to last election, with the last election mainly taking place between 2015 and 2018 (for details, see Kroll and Zipperer 2020). Most countries fall into Quadrant I and IV. In other words, while most of the countries examined have experienced progress towards the SDGs, they differ in terms of whether the electorate has subsequently turned to populists or not. A number of countries have also experienced SDG regress, and subsequently seen an increase in electoral support for populists (Quadrant I). Almost no countries can be found in Quadrant III, with Greece being an exception where possibly a disillusionment with populists has meant that voters turned away from them. An additional analysis for each SDG separately can be found in the paper.

As political systems in many nations continue to be faced with growing populist parties, our analysis sheds some light onto examples where mainstream political parties prevailed as unchallenged political hegemons in light of their good performance on economic, social, and environmental SDGs. A particularly promising avenue for future research may be dissecting the political discourses in the countries where populists have triumphed despite progress towards the SDGs being made (Quadrant I: “disillusioned performers”), and what differentiates such a political discourse from that taking place in countries of the other categories, especially the “consolidating achievers” group. In other words: Why does success on the SDGs result in diminishing support for populists in certain countries but not in some others?

In order to further explore the nature of the statistical relationship between the two concepts beyond the aforementioned framework, we also performed a linear regression analysis. We thereby examined the SDG performance over time as a potential determinant of the populist vote share in the subsequent election. We find a significant negative effect of overall SDG country performance over time on the change in populist vote share (controlling for GDP per capita change PPP). For each one-point increase on the aggregate SDG Index (out of 100), the vote share of populist parties on average drops by about two percentage points. We also find significant negative effects of progress in SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), and SDG 15 (Life on land). The effect sizes vary as follows. For each one-point increase on the SDG 1 indicator (out of 100), the vote share of populist parties on average drops by about 0.3 percentage points, while for SDG 2 it drops by about 2.4 percentage points. For SDG 11, the drop is by about one percentage point, and for SDG 15 by about half a percentage point.

Making the SDGs the blueprint for the COVID-19 recovery

As countries are now beginning to organise the recovery after COVID-19, many commentators have expressed concerns that the hardship associated with the crisis might be exploited by populists in numerous countries, potentially leading to a new wave of electoral support for populism. The lessons from recent findings discussed here lend support to the notion that a strong commitment to the SDGs (overall, as well as in particular to the SDGs 2, 11, and 15) could be part of an appropriate and effective answer to populism. The SDGs would therefore be a very suitable blueprint for the COVID-19 recovery.

Grieving and frustrated: Black scientists call out racism in the wake of police killings

As marchers in the United States and around the world filled the streets this past week to protest against police brutality and racial injustice, Black scientists grieved openly on social media, calling for action on racism in society and in science. Many stated ways in which institutions and colleagues, from collaborators to meeting organizers, could support Black scientists. Some pushed universities and scientific societies to release statements against racism. And several posted that the weight of the current events has made it even harder to do their jobs in a profession that already marginalizes them.

Hundreds are planning to stop their research tomorrow (except for time-sensitive activities related to COVID-19) as part of an academic strike in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. The goal is to take “time to learn, reflect, critique, and chart a course of action”, writes Particles for Justice, a group of physicists co-organizing the strike.

“Horrible.” “Totally unreliable.” “A buggy mess.” Over the past month, software engineers have sharply criticized the code underpinning an influential coronavirus simulation by scientists at Imperial College London, one of several models that helped sway UK politicians into declaring a lockdown. Now, a computational neuroscientist has reported that he has independently rerun the simulation and reproduced its results. And other scientists have told Nature that they had already privately verified that the code is reproducible.

IBM will no longer sell “general purpose” facial-recognition technology, chief executive Arvind Krishna wrote in a letter to US Congress. The letter addressed the need for reforms and policy proposals to address racial disparities, and mentioned that the company opposes using technology for mass surveillance, racial profiling and violations of human rights. Krishna wrote that “vendors and users of Al systems have a shared responsibility to ensure that Al is tested for bias, particularly when used in law enforcement”.

Archaeologists have mapped a full ancient city with ground-penetrating radar. Falerii Novi, a 30-hectare settlement near Rome that was occupied between 241 BC and AD 700, is now almost entirely buried under agricultural land. The team towed their radar antennas with a quad bike. Their finds include a mysterious public monument — possibly linked to pre-Roman religions — and an extensive network of water pipes that was evidently planned and laid before the city was built. The non-invasive technique has a lot of potential, says archaeologist Martin Millett. “As I wander around the Roman empire, I look at all kinds of places and think, ‘Wow, what we could do there.’”

Lockdowns and other distancing measures have had resounding success at thwarting the new coronavirus, according to two independently conducted studies. One found that stay-at-home orders and policies that restrict face-to-face contact were especially effective in 11 European countries, reducing transmission by 81%. The combination of policies aimed at slowing the virus’s spread prevented more than 3 million deaths from the epidemic’s start to early May. Another study that looked at China, the United States and 4 more countries showed that across all 6 countries, anti-transmission measures averted roughly 500 million infections. Contaminated surfaces might have only a minor role in transmitting COVID-19 within households. Researchers looked for traces of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in 21 households that each included at least one infected person. They found viral RNA in just 3% of samples from the most frequently touched objects, such as door knobs, and in 15% of samples from bathroom drains and toilets. The team could not grow infectious virus from any of the samples. Researchers have identified two human gene variants that could make people more susceptible to lung failure associated with COVID-19. One variant lies in the swathe of the genome that determines blood groups. People with blood type A+ had an increased risk of lung failure compared with those with other blood types, whereas those with type O blood were protected to some extent. The second variant, on chromosome 3, is near six genes, including one that interacts with the molecular receptor that the virus uses to enter human cells.

2020-06-09||Since the first case of Covid-19 was found in New Zealand on 28th February we have all had to change our way of life. These Wellington images and video portray some of that journey.

Real estate agents are adopting new strategies to survive the lockdown and do business in the transformed economic landscape, writes Rakesh Krishnan.

Not surprisingly, the lack of ability to conduct business face to face during the lockdown has caused major disruption in the way people function in this sector.

With people generally insecure about their jobs or maybe even having lost their jobs, many potential home buyers are – at least for the short term – reluctant to plonk down their cash on a big-ticket purchase. Consequently, many real estate agents have adopted innovative strategies to cope during these unprecedented times.

Some of the agents Prosper talked to said the first few days of the lockdown felt really strange and it took a bit of getting used to, but after a week or so a new normal emerged. There was a realisation that you had to make the best of a dicey situation.

Green Bay-based Vicky Ingham of Ray White had a new listing ready to go live in the week of the lockdown but after discussion with the vendor she held it over until level 3. "I made myself available to buyers and sellers who needed advice over the lockdown period but took care not to contact people who may have been under stress during that time," she said.

The new normal in real estate is that if you can't hit the bricks, go online. Ingham points out that some of her colleagues were able to secure contracts over the lockdown which included a clause 'subject to the purchaser viewing in level 3'. "This worked well for buyers who loved the look of a home online, with the option of being able to view at a later date before declaring a contract unconditional," she said.

Ingham, who has been in the industry for close to a decade, points out that many aspects of real estate work can be effectively managed online. FlexiSign is a product which allows for signing of contracts online; virtual tours are now offered by most real estate photographers; and online auctions are being further developed.

So what's in store for Auckland's real estate industry?

"Contactless online marketing will become more dominant than ever and being up to speed with product development will be vital," Ingham said.

"Going forward, technology will just get better and while it allows us to do a high quality job, everything in the short term will run at a slower pace to enable us to keep buyers and vendors and their properties safe."

Robbie Bhullar and Vish Bhati of Barfoot & Thompson agree technology is rapidly transforming the real estate industry. Until recently, the two West Auckland agents were selling a property every 4.74 days, so the Covid-19 pandemic has been especially hard on them.

However, being early adopters of technology helped them mitigate some of the after-effects of the slowdown. "Even as trading remained restricted during the lockdown, we were able to do digital negotiation and contactless transactions with existing customers," they said. "Electronic platforms such as DocuSign, Trello and CRM systems made things easy during the lockdown."

South Auckland-based Heather Obern and Kevin Arthur of Ray White Manukau observe online marketing and communication has already become the primary medium of selling in the industry. "During the lockdown it was our window on the world," they said. "Properties can and are being sold without physical viewing, especially for investment, but most home buyers still want to view the home and see what it 'feels' like. Enhanced digital viewings will help people decide whether they really want a physical viewing."

According to Heather and Kevin, off-market listings are becoming a significant segment of the market and may be more appealing in the post-Covid marketplace. These are listed properties that are not widely advertised but available through an agent. "This gives tighter control around viewing, more vendor privacy and better qualified buyers. We also think more salespeople will work away from their offices, using virtual communications and online meetings at times. Offices may shrink in size as a result."

Clearly, the real estate landscape has changed, and not everyone will come unscathed through the current crisis. The industry is based on commission-only income, so agents without a reservoir of experience or in offices that aren't professional or using new strategies will struggle – they will be outclassed by savvy competitors.

Agents believe the removal of the loan-to-value restrictions (LVR), attractive low interest rates and a lower median price should bring in more first-time buyers, giving the market a boost. While this may not be the best time to be a real estate agent, those with skin in the game are putting up a brave front. Perhaps there's no other alternative.||2
2020-06-09||The Australian Dollar extended its recent upturn, consolidating a break above 0.70 US cents on Monday. Equity markets and a sustained risk on move dragged the currency higher, while broad based US dollar weakness helped mark fresh highs at 0.7029. With much of the country enjoying an extended long weekend in observance of the Queen’s birthday the AUD took its cues from offshore risk flows, while reports New Zealand is now COVID-19 free and moving to level 1 restrictions helped bolster demand and drag the AUD higher still. The AUD advanced against the USD, GBP and EURO while giving up ground against the NZD, JPY and CHF. The correction against the JPY and CHF suggest the weeks early moves weren’t driven by typical risk on dynamics rather mounting USD uncertainty. With recent gains pushing the top-end of short term models we expect some resistance on moves beyond 0.70. That said the AUD advance can be supported by improving fundamentals and as the Australian economy looks set to rebound at a faster pace than first anticipated there is scope to suggest further upside in the medium term.

Attentions this week remain with risk drivers while the Fed and FOMC policy meeting Wednesday dominates the macroeconomic docket.

The US dollar remains under pressure, slipping against all major counterparts through trade on Monday. The Japanese Yen and Swiss France both enjoyed strong gains, recovering much of lasts weeks losses and topping gains across majors for the day. The upturn for the JPY and CHF suggests Monday’s move was not a typical risk on shift but rather broad-based USD weakness. With the US struggling to contain the coronavirus and Congress slow to deliver Fiscal support investors are moving away from the USD as the safe haven dynamic shifts.

The Euro continues to enjoy sustained upside support, holding near 1.13 on open this morning, while the GBP advanced four tenths of a percent pushing toward 1.2750. Despite its own underlying instability, the GBP has enjoyed strong gains through the last month, bouncing off lows at 1.2080. Given the broad-based USD weakness a better measure or Sterling is its performance against key crosses. The GBP has plunged against both the NZD and AUD while Euro/pound despite moderating through the start of June is up almost 2 cents since the start of May. The Coronavirus continues to plague the UK, and while they reported the lowest number of fatalities since the March lockdown began, 55 people still lost their lives to COVID-19 a number much to high if restrictions are to see any meaningful easing. As the UK struggles to throw off the coronavirus and Brexit looking ever larger there is little to drive GBP upside through the medium term.

Attentions today remain with risk and broad-based US direction ahead of tomorrow FOMC meeting and Fed policy announcement.

2020-06-09||Ireland is facing a “tsunami” of mental health problems due to the coronavirus pandemic, with early indications showing an increase in suicide and self-harm, health experts warn.

Data collection on suicides by Irish hospitals were suspended as a result of the lockdown, meaning there are no current figures on suicide and self-harm rates, according to the National Self-Harm Registry.

However other data sources point to a significant upward trend. In March and April of this year, 17 per cent of patients admitted to the National Spinal Injuries Unit in the Mater Hospital had sustained injuries in a suicide attempt compared to one per cent in the same period last year.

The numbers involved are small but they reflect a trend which is being seen elsewhere. According to a recent US study, 45 per cent of people with suicidal thoughts explicitly linked them to Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.

On Monday, the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland (CPI) concluded a survey of 615 consultants. The data is still being analysed but there are early indications of a worrying trend, the college said.

“A large proportion of consultants are reporting that they are now seeing an increase in people experiencing both new-onset and relapse of mental illness compared to the early stages of the lockdown but also to before the lockdown came into place,” said Andrea Ryder of the CPI.

Increasing numbers of patients are presenting with suicidal ideation and signs of self-harm, she said.

“We can see and we know that a tsunami of mental health issues are coming. We know that anecdotally from us working as clinicians in emergency hospitals and in community settings,” said Professor Fiona McNicholas, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist.

There is particular concern about the mental health of young people already prone to anxiety and the elderly who have been forced to cocoon since the start of the pandemic.

In one young person, the lockdown exacerbated an eating disorder, said Prof McNicholas.

“The loss of their ability to engage in their usual exercises led them to over focus on eating. They presented in a very malnourished state with typical anorexic behaviour.”

In a second case, a previously healthy young boy started exercising on his own to maintain his fitness during lockdown.

“Unfortunately for him, it led to exercise addiction,” said Prof McNicholas. “To the point where he lost 20 per cent of his body weight and was medically compromised.”

Dr John Lyne, a consultant general adult psychiatrist and editor of the IJPM, said there is potential for an increase in suicides, particularly if there is a severe economic depression. In the past social upheavals such as the Troubles or the 2008 recession, were associated with raised suicide rates, which can last for years.

The pandemic has also coincided with an increase in other mental health crises. In March and April the number of applications by gardaí to the Mental Health Commission (MHC) for the involuntary admission of mentally ill people increased by 7 per cent compared to the same period last year.

“However, the reason for this slight increase is not possible without a more detailed analysis,” the MHC said.

2020-06-09||Several large-scale genomic studies are gearing up to pin down the genes underlying individual responses to COVID-19. Genomics England is partnering with Illumina and the UK National Health Service (NHS) to sequence the genomes of 35,000 patients: 15,000 with mild symptoms and 20,000 who required intensive care. A separate group, UK BioBank, is assembling research materials from data on patients with COVID-19 collected by Public Health England, which they will share with 15,000 approved researchers from 85 countries. Finally, nearly 1,000 human geneticists formed the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, organized by the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland.

Private companies are also contributing. Consumer genomics companies 23andme and Ancestry.com are setting up programs to link COVID-19 symptoms and experiences with genomic information contained in their databases. In the first few weeks 23andme identified 6,000 people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and in May stepped up its efforts to assemble thousands more by offering free genome analysis to non-members who qualify and are willing to join a COVID-19 research program. Ancestry.com has asked its customer base to fill out a survey on their COVID-19 experiences, the results of which they will share with qualified researchers at no cost.

In the largest study of any kind on COVID-19, a team led by Ben Goldacre at the University of Oxford reported in the preprint server medRxiv that Asians and members of minority groups in the UK face an increased risk of death by COVID-19. Analyzing health records of over 17 million patients from the NHS, the researchers found that comorbidities (such as heart disease, diabetes, asthma and obesity), largely assumed to be behind the increased risk, accounted for only about half the disparity in deaths between minority and white populations. A smaller study by the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners looking at risk factors for testing positive for COVID-19 was published in mid-May.||2
2020-06-09||The killing of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police department, and President Donald Trump’s crushing of protests across the United States, has angered the world, and led to marches in cities globally. The repeated killings of Black people in the United States serve as reminders — reminders that should not be needed — of the injustice, violence and systemic inequality that Black Americans continue to experience in every sphere of life.

Black people are more likely than white people to die at the hands of the police; more likely to become unemployed; and, as COVID-19 has laid bare, more likely to be burdened with ill health. Black people are similarly marginalized in most nations where they are in the minority.

Nature condemns police prejudice and violence, we stand against all forms of racism and we join others around the world in saying, unequivocally, that Black Lives Matter.

Such statements are necessary, but they are not sufficient. They need to be followed by meaningful action.

Black people, including researchers, are taking to social media to spell out what that action should look like, calling attention to decades of literature on the steps necessary to make academia and science equitable. This outpouring is, in part, because Black researchers have long been denied a space and a platform in established institutions and publications such as this one.

We recognize that Nature is one of the white institutions that is responsible for bias in research and scholarship. The enterprise of science has been — and remains — complicit in systemic racism, and it must strive harder to correct those injustices and amplify marginalized voices.

At Nature, we will redouble our efforts to do so, and commit to establishing a process that will hold us to account on the many changes we need to make.

In addition, we commit to producing a special issue of the journal, under the guidance of a guest editor, exploring systemic racism in research, research policy and publishing — including investigating Nature’s part in that.

Together with the rest of the research community, we must listen, reflect, learn and act — and we must never shirk our responsibility to end systemic racism.||1
2020-06-09||In times of crisis, humans have a tendency to turn to religion for comfort and explanation. The COVID-19 pandemic is no exception. Using daily data on Google searches for 95 countries, this column demonstrates that the COVID-19 crisis has increased Google searches for prayer (relative to all Google searches) to the highest level ever recorded. By the end of March 2020, more than half of the world population had prayed to ‘end the coronavirus’. Prayer searches rose at all levels of income, inequality, and insecurity, but not for the 10% least religious countries.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought sizeable costs for societies across the globe. A pandemic of this size potentially changes our societies for years to come, especially if it impacts our ingrained values and beliefs. It may have impacted values such as populism, nationalism (Morelli 2020, Baldwin and Weder di Mauro 2020), and economic anxiety (Fetzer et al. 2020). In a new paper (Bentzen 2020), I document the manner in which the COVID-19 crisis has influenced one of the most deeply rooted human behaviours: Religion. People pray in order to cope with uncertainty and adversity.

This rising religiosity may have implications for the economy in various ways. First, a large part of the economic downturn in the face of COVID-19 is due to economic anxiety (Andersen et al. 2020, Fetzer et al. 2020). If religion dampens anxiety, religious societies may experience smaller reductions in consumption. It is evident that religion worked as such a buffer during previous large macroeconomic downturns caused by the Spanish flu and WWI (Bentzen and Dalgaard 2020).

Second, COVID-19 may increase religiosity permanently, which in turn could impact the wider economy. Likewise, it should be noted that earthquakes increase religiosity permanently across generations (Bentzen 2019). Previous research has documented a multitude of correlations between religiosity and socio-economic factors: from peoples’ ability to cope with stress and uncertainty, to reductions in criminal behavior (Guiso et al. 2003, Miller et al. 2014), to lower GDP growth and more traditional gender roles (McCleary and Barro 2006, Inglehart and Norris 2003).

Third, rising ‘prayer intensity’ reveals that people from across the globe experience emotional distress in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, and they use religion in order to cope. The economic consequences of these emotional effects may be large (Andersen et al. 2020), with the main part of the economic downturn being due to the perceived risk of the virus, rather than government mandated lockdowns.

In my recent paper, I identify empirically the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic has induced people across the globe to pray, whether the phenomenon is global, and who prays in times of crisis. Google searches for religious terms, as a share of all Google searches, provides a signal of peoples’ interest in religion in real time. Various research suggests that our behaviour on the internet reflects our personal interests and the actions we take in the real world (Moat et al. 2016, Olivola et al. 2019, Ginsberg et al. 2009). Likewise, whether or not we search for religious terms on the internet reflects our religious preferences (Yeung 2019, Stephens-Davidowich 2015).

The main analysis focuses on searches for the topic ‘prayer’, including all topics related to prayer in all languages. Searches for other religious terms also rise, such as God, Allah, Muhammad, Quran, Bible, and Jesus, and, to a lesser extent, searches for Buddha, Vishnu, and Shiva (the latter two being Hindu gods).

Events that instigate intensified prayer are clearly visible in the data. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Ramadan contributed to the largest yearly increase in the global search intensity for prayer (Panel A of Figure 1). Also, prayer search shares spike upwards on Sundays everywhere. Searches for prayer surged in Iran on 07 January 2020, coinciding with the funeral of Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian major general killed by US troops. Similar spikes were seen in Australia on 05 January 2020, when the movement "Prayer for Australia" swept across the world in the midst of the unprecedented bushfires, and in Albania on 26 November 2019 when the country was hit by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake.

In March 2020, the share of Google searches for prayer surged to the highest level ever recorded, surpassing all other major events that otherwise call for prayer, such as Christmas, Easter, and Ramadan (Figure 1). The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The level of prayer search shares in March 2020 was more than 50% higher than the average during February 2020. For comparison, the surge in Google searches for prayer was 1.3 times larger than the rise in searches for takeaways, and amounted to 12% of the rise in Netflix searches or 26% of the fall in searches for flights, which all saw massive changes globally (since most countries were in lockdown and air traffic was shut down).

Figure 1 Worldwide Google searches for “prayer” during the past 4 years

Notes: Google searches for prayer relative to the total number of Google searches. The maximum shares were set to 100. The searches encompass all topics related to prayer, including alternative spellings and languages. The vertical stippled lines in panel (a) represent the first week of the Ramadan. The period in panel (a) is the longest period for which comparable data was available at the time of writing. The period in panel (b) is the period used in the main analysis (starting before COVID-19 became a pandemic and ending before the onset of Easter and the Ramadan).

Google search results for ‘prayer’ usually provide prayer texts to use when praying. Prayers may be recited from memory or read from a book. In modern times, these books or verses of prayer can be found on the internet. One of the most searched for prayer categories in March 2020 was "Coronavirus prayer", which are prayers that ask God for protection against the coronavirus, prayers to stay strong, and prayers to thank nurses for their efforts. According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, more than half of Americans had prayed to end the coronavirus (Pew 2020b).

Using daily data on Google searches for prayer for 95 countries across the globe, I find that the rise visible in Figure 1 occurs around 11 March 2020 for most countries, and increasingly so after their own populations had been infected. The rise in prayer is a global phenomenon, with all countries (except the 10% least religious) seeing significant rises in prayer search shares. Figure 2 illustrates which countries saw the largest rise in searches for prayer, indicated by darker shades of green. Regionally, the largest increases occur in South America, Africa, and Indonesia, some of the most religious areas of the world. In general, the more religious societies searched more for prayer on the internet. Prayer searches rose for all major religious denominations, but only significantly for Christians and Muslims. The rise was more modest for Hindus and Buddhists.

Figure 2 The rise in prayer search shares across the globe in March 2020

Notes: Darker green indicates larger rises in prayer search shares. Missing data is indicated with grey.

Prayer search shares rose more in poorer, more insecure, and more unequal countries. However, this impact is exclusively due to these countries being more religious. This indicates that the availability of religion may be more important for its’ use in coping, rather than the potential need for religion.

Using these results (and the Pew (2020b) survey documenting that more than half of the Americans had prayed to end the coronavirus), a back of the envelope calculation shows that more than half of the global population had prayed to end the coronavirus by the end of March 2020.

The main reason for the rising interest in prayer on the internet is religious coping, where people use their religion to cope with adversity (Pargament 2001). They pray for relief, understanding, and comfort. Research has documented that people struggling with cancer, death within their close family, or severe illness are more religious. Recent research shows that adversity in the form of natural disasters causes people to use their religion more intensively (Bentzen 2019, Sibley and Bulbulia 2012).

People may use Google to search for prayer for a reason unrelated to religious coping. They may be searching for online forums to replace their physical churches that closed down in an attempt to enforce social distancing. Theoretically, we would not expect this to be the main explanation for the rising search shares for prayer. People tend to use mainly their intrinsic religiosity (such as private prayer) rather than their extrinsic religiosity (such as churchgoing) to cope with adversity (Pargament 2001 and Bentzen 2019). In addition, a recent survey reveals that 95% of Americans who pray, pray alone, while only 2% pray collectively in a church (Barna 2017). Thus, even if the churches had been open, we would expect prayer to rise more than churchgoing. Another survey shows that 24% of Americans respond that their faith has strengthened since the onset of the coronavirus crisis, which we would not have predicted if people were simply replacing their physical churchgoing with online church (Pew 2020a). They must be doing something that strengthens their faith. The empirical results support the claim that replacement of physical churches is not the main reason for the rise in Google searches for prayer. For instance, searches for the topic "internet church" also rise but follow a distinctly different pattern than the prayer searches (and the change is of a much smaller magnitude). Also, the search shares for prayer continue to rise long after the church closures. Further, the rise in prayer searches is not limited to Sundays, where most masses are held, but occur on al||0

2020-06-10||Part of the rationale for such barriers is the critical importance of Canadian experience and the need for medical professionals to meet Canadian standards. Requirements for residency experience within Canada are coupled with a limited number of spots, which essentially forces many physicians to start over despite having potentially decades of experience under their belt. Even Canadian-trained medical students can struggle to find placements, but for internationally trained physicians it is even more difficult. In 2019, the Canadian Residency Matching Service reported that out of 1,758 international medical graduates, 1,360 were not matched with residency placements. And even if internationally trained physicians receive a spot, they are often underemployed and unsupported, leading to financial and emotional hardship.

As foreign experts languish in the system, the need for physicians continues to be great. Many institutions have noted Canada falls behind the majority of OECD nations when it comes to physicians per capita. According to the World Bank, Canada has only 2.6 doctors for every 1,000 residents. Italy, which until recently was the epicentre of the pandemic, has about 50 per cent more per capita.

The COVID-19 crisis has spurred some promising initiatives to leverage this untapped talent pool to address an immense need. Italy, the United Kingdom and some American states have eased the requirements for internationally educated physicians and novice medical graduates to contribute to national COVID-19 efforts. For example, in New Jersey, authorities have granted temporary licences to doctors residing in state with good standing in foreign countries. In New York, internationally trained medical graduates are now allowed to treat patients after one year of residency, compared to the regular requirement of three years.

Some medical licensing bodies in Canada are taking similar steps. For example, in Ontario, international medical graduates who have passed their exams in Canada can apply for a 30-day medical licence. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia has fast-tracked a new bylaw to amend the province’s Health Professions Act so international medical graduates can apply for a supervised associate physician licence allowing them to work under the supervision of attending physicians.

These efforts to lower barriers to entry show promise as a way to address the immediate health crisis. But the pandemic also presents a crucial opportunity to leverage this globally educated talent pool over the long term. The Canadian population is aging and more health care is being delivered outside of hospitals, so we will continue to need more health professionals in the community. Many Canadians also find it challenging to find a physician who understands their mother tongue and cultural context; internationally trained medical professionals can help plug those health equity gaps.

We need federal leadership during this crisis to ensure there is coordination across all jurisdictions to achieve clarity for internationally trained physicians. Canada should consider several options to achieve this:
• Adopt the solution proposed by the Ontario Council of Agencies Serving Immigrants, Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council and World Education Services to recruit, train and deploy internationally trained physicians to support our health-care systems during this time of emergency.
• Automatically grant physicians who have been provided a temporary licence during the pandemic the ability to practise to their full capacity afterwards.
• Increase the number of residency spaces for internationally trained physicians.
• Once this pandemic passes, a federal-provincial-territorial working group should be established to examine the issue more deeply and build pan-Canadian consensus. One of the first tasks assigned to this entity should be to create a simplified accreditation process across the country.

Over the past number of years, we’ve seen various orders of government, academic institutions and self-governed medical professions work together to make some progress, such as investing in bridging programs and placements for internationally trained physicians. This is a helpful start but more needs to be done. COVID-19 provides an opportunity to accelerate the many good program and policy ideas that have already been discussed or introduced in ways that are too limited. Now is the time to make real and lasting progress to help our health-care system, internationally trained medical professionals and Canadians in need of health care.

2020-06-10||Because prison visits and social mingling have been curtailed recently as part of Covid-19 precautions, the New York City Department of Corrections have decided to buy 5500 handheld gaming machines at a cost of $US15 ($22) each to try and give inmates at the city’s prisons something else to do.

As the Daily News reported last month, the handhelds—which look like Game Boys but most definitely are not—were purchased in March from a distributor for a total of $US82,500 ($118,475), and came in red, blue and yellow variants. They’ve been handed out to the 3800 prisoners still in detention at places like Rikers Island (many inmates on minor sentences have been freed as part of prison system’s attempts to curb the spread of Covi-19 in jails).

They’re clearly a version of those shitty “1000-in-1″ systems that include a bunch of pre-loaded stuff, but interestingly—for Nintendo’s lawyers if nobody else—every version I’ve seen matching this case design online is also advertising that it’s loaded with a bunch of bootleg Nintendo/Capcom/Konami games.||1

2020-06-10||A quarter of all rural US hospitals, most of which are highly essential to their communities, are at high risk of closing.Hospital closures may increase transport time and delay treatment. This column examines hospital closures in California from 1995 to 2011 to assess the effects of rural and urban hospital closures on inpatient mortality. Mortality increases after a rural hospital closure not only in the local rural area but in the neighbouring urban areas as well. This adverse effect is larger for Medicaid patients and racial minorities.

About 15% of all US hospitals have closed since 1990, and the rate of closures has accelerated in recent years, in part due to declining inpatient use (Carroll 2019, Lindrooth et al. 2003). Rural closures have increased since 2010 and 25% of all rural hospitals – of which 82% are considered highly essential to their communities – are at high risk of closing (Mosley and Debehnke 2020, North Carolina Rural Health Research Program 2020, Holmes et al. 2017). There have been prominent media outcries regarding the rural hospital crisis, including in 2020 presidential campaign discussions (McCausland 2019, Tribble 2019, Estes 2020, Raffa 2019, Frakt 2018).

Internationally, too, smaller, rural, and remote hospitals are under the threat of closures (Vaughan and Edwards 2020). Low patient volumes, low reimbursement rates, and costly uncompensated care are commonly cited reasons for weakened hospital finances that lead to closures (Carroll 2019, Lindrooth et al. 2018, Kaufman et al. 2016).

The COVID-19 pandemic (or any future economic downturn) is expected to worsen the situation. COVID-19 has led to a 12.1% drop in the US GDP component related to hospitals, and as millions of workers lose their employer-covered insurance, hospitals could be facing unprecedented levels of uncompensated care, drastically increasing the risk of and concerns related to hospital closures (Federation of American Hospitals 2020, Mosley and Debehnke 2020, Ellison 2020).

Hospital closures pose a conundrum for economists, policymakers, and hospital administrators. Closures may seem reasonable and inevitable if hospitals are suffering financially, but they can severely fracture patient access and cause enormous harm to patient health (Kaufman et al. 2016).

In a well-functioning market, a firm’s shutdown often signals underlying inefficiency or low product demand. Previous studies have shown this to be the case for the hospital industry, where closures – especially urban ones – were positively associated with inefficiency (Capps et al. 2010, Lindrooth 2003).

A large body of literature suggests that the risk of closure is higher for smaller and non-profit hospitals. Large hospitals can achieve greater efficiency through economies of scale and for-profit hospitals are more responsive to competitive pressures and can ‘cream-skim’ or choose patients that enhance profitability (Allen 2017, Hodgson, et al. 2015, Lindrooth et al. 2003).

The natural divide between rural and urban hospitals

The cost structure, profit motives, and patient mix of hospitals thus engender a natural divide between rural and urban hospitals, one that has continued to widen in recent years (Lindrooth et al. 2018, Thomas et al. 2016, Kaufman et al. 2016).

Rural hospitals may be too small to operate efficiently (Song and Saghafian 2019, Carroll 2019), and economic downturns lead to shrinking populations in rural areas, implying lower patient volumes at hospitals.

Populations left behind may be older, sicker, and more reliant on Medicaid and Medicare, which are financially less favourable payer-mixes for hospitals, making rural hospitals more susceptible to closures and cause for high concern (Kaufman et al. 2016). The same concerns regarding financial viability may also deter new hospitals from entering rural healthcare markets.

Effects of rural hospital closures on patient access and health outcomes

Efficiency considerations of closures must, nonetheless, account for their effect on patient welfare. Urban closures may increase overall patient welfare through by way of cost savings for all patients from the closure of inefficient hospitals (Capps et al. 2010), but patient access and outcomes are also crucial components of patient welfare (Gaynor and Town 2011).

Even if market forces drive hospital shutdowns, closures raise significant concerns about increased transportation time, treatment delay, and adverse health outcomes, especially for emergency care (Miller et al. 2020, Carroll 2019, Sun et al. 2005, Wishner et al. 2016). Patient disutility from access issues can offset utility gains from cost savings, particularly in rural markets (Hsia and Shen 2011, McNamara 1999).

Compared to studies examining reasons for or the financial impact of closures, literature studying the effect of hospital closures, both rural and urban, on patient outcomes is relatively sparse and lacks consensus. Large-scale published studies have found no impact of closures on patient mortality with some evidence of improved outcomes, i.e. a reduction in mortality, for heart attack patients (Joynt et al. 2015). Only one published county-level study (Buchmueller et al. 2006) thus far has shown adverse patient-level impact, i.e. increased deaths due to urban closures.

Given the recent increase in closures, crucial efforts to ascertain the patient-level impact are currently underway; recent working papers (Song and Saghafian 2019, Carroll 2019) do find that closures can increase mortality. However, the emerging and existing work has focused almost exclusively on Medicare patients; there is a need to also study potentially more vulnerable non-Medicare populations.

Patient outcome studies either examine rural closures while ignoring concurrent urban closures (making it difficult to disentangle the isolated effect of rural closures) or study the general effect of closures without distinguishing rural from urban. However, there are baseline and post-closure differences between rural and urban hospitals and markets that suggest potentially different effects of rural and urban closures.

At baseline, rural patients face larger transportation times and access barriers, bypass nearby hospitals, and are more likely to use hospitals for primary care needs, compared to urban patients (Wishner et al. 2016, Escarce and Kapur 2009). Rural patients experience a 76% increase in ambulance transportation time post-closure in their ZIP code, whereas urban patients do not experience any such change post-closure in their ZIP code (Troske and Davis 2019).

While urban patients may shift their usual source of care from hospitals to physicians’ offices (Buchmueller et al. 2006), no such favourable substitution is observed for rural patients (Rosenbach and Dayhoff 1995), most likely because there are fewer remaining alternatives in rural areas.

Additionally, rural closures can lead to immediate, substantial, and persistent outmigration of healthcare professionals (Germack et al. 2019, Manlove and Whitacre 2017), dismembering patient access and jeopardising patient outcomes. As rural hospitals are an integral part of the community’s economic foundation, closures also have dire consequences on the local economy (Manlove and Whitacre 2017, Holmes et al. 2006, Probst et al. 1999).

Given such baseline and post-closure differences, the overall adverse effect of a rural hospital closure, which includes transportation delays and related spillover effects, is likely larger than that of an urban closure.

Our recent working paper (Gujral and Basu 2019) uses a difference-in-difference approach to study the impact of rural and urban hospital closures in California in 1995–2011, on adjusted inpatient mortality for time-sensitive conditions. Outcomes of admissions in hospital service areas with and without closure(s) (‘treatment’ versus ‘control’, respectively) are compared before and after the closure year (Figure 1).

Notes: Map of California showing rural and urban ZIP codes, closure ZIP codes, and hospital service area boundaries that indicate affected patients.

We focus on: (1) the differential effects of rural and urban hospital closures, and (2) the effect on Medicare as well as non-Medicare populations.

Figure 2 shows trends in unadjusted inpatient mortality before and after closures. The control group and the general (non-differentiated) treatment group follow a similar trajectory prior to closure, and there does not appear to be any change post-closure for the treatment group.

Figure 2 Unadjusted inpatient mortality for admissions in hospital service areas with and without hospital closures

This graphical observation is supported by the difference-in-difference estimation, wherein we find no measurable impact of closures on inpatient mortality, similar to Joynt et al. (2015) and Hsia et al. (2012).

We then differentiate the treatment group by rurality, as shown in Figure 3. The left-hand side shows that in urban areas, there is no change in unadjusted inpatient mortality after the hospital closure, similar to Figure 2 above. However, the right-hand side shows a post-hospital-closure increase in mortality for rural areas.

Figure 3 Unadjusted inpatient mortality for urban and rural areas with and without hospital closures

Notes: Unadjusted inpatient mortality for: control vs urban treatment group (top), and control vs rural treatment group (bottom).

The difference-in-difference estimation shows that rural closures increase inpatient mortality by 8.7%, while urban closures have no measurable impact. This suggests that when no distinction is made between rural or urban closures, the null effect of urban closures have the potential to dominate and mask the significant and detrimental impact of rural closures.

Our subgroup analyses indicate that Medicaid patients and racial minorities are relatively worse affected by rural closures (11.3% and 12.6%, respectively), which supports the ||1
2020-06-10||The role of social capital in promoting social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US

Reducing social contacts can slow the spread of COVID-19. This column examines mobility patterns across US counties between mid-February and mid-May 2020. It finds that reductions in mobility differed across counties, and that community-level social capital can explain the geographic variations in mobility trends. Individuals reduced mobility earlier and to a higher degree in counties with high levels of social capital. Many counties, particularly in the Southeast US, may be especially vulnerable to COVID-19, matching low levels of social capital with high rates of chronic disease.

Until a vaccine or effective pharmacological treatments for COVID-19 become widely available, individuals can protect themselves and others around them through a combination of social distancing and behavioural changes that reduce transmission when contacts occur. The scientific community has highlighted the importance of limiting social contacts and governments worldwide have either advised or mandated sheltering-in-place orders to promote behavioural changes (Hartl et al. 2020). However, social distancing has major economic and social consequences for both individuals and communities (Glover et al. 2020, Coibion et al. 2020). Therefore, rather than a prolonged period of strict distancing until treatment or immunisation make social gatherings safe, coexisting with the virus is most likely to entail the monitoring of local epidemiological curves and by a sequence of tighter and looser restrictions moving in sync with such curves. It is therefore important to identify what factors are associated with individuals and communities being able to alter their behaviour either voluntarily or in compliance with regulations.

Evidence from the H1N1 pandemic reveals that the likelihood that individuals implemented behavioural changes in 2009 to reduce H1H1 transmission depended, among other things, on their social capital (Chuang et al. 2015; Rönnerstrand 2013, 2014). Social capital reflects the resources and benefits that individuals and groups acquire through connections with others and involves both shared norms and values that promote cooperation as well as actual social relationships (Kawachi et al. 2008).

Evidence on the role of social capital in shaping behavioural responses during the COVID-19 pandemic is beginning to emerge (see Borgonovi and Andrieu 2020, Bargain and Aminjonov 2020, Durante et al. 2020). We contribute to this line of work by examining data from US counties to identify how communities with different levels of social capital responded to the threat posed by COVID-19 by changing one type of behaviour: mobility. We examine mobility patterns between 17 February, when there was little awareness of the public health threat posed by COVID-19 among the general population in the US, and 10 May, by which point as many as 1.3 million individuals had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and about 80 thousand were reported to have died because of COVID-19.

Data on county-level social capital come from the “The geography of social capital” project and mobility data come from the Cuebiq's Mobility Index (CMI). Data from Cuebiq has been used to map movements in Italian provinces prior to and following the implementation of restrictions to movement because of COVID-19.

Figure 1 reveals that both communities with high levels of social capital (counties in top quarter of the social capital index) and communities with low levels of social capital (counties in bottom quarter of the index) changed their mobility patterns between 17 February and 10 May. Mobility was already lower at baseline in areas with higher levels of social capital and decreased markedly in such areas from the week starting on 9 March onwards. Such communities reduced mobility sooner than communities with lower levels of social capital, i.e. when reducing mobility was not yet legally mandated. These communities also reduced mobility to a much greater extent than communities with lower levels of social capital. Mobility returned close to baseline in both high and low social capital communities by 10 May, although observing mobility levels in mid-May that are comparable to those observed in February should be viewed as a form of behavioural change: mobility tends to be greater when the days are longer and weather conditions are more favourable to outdoor activities.

Figure 1 Changes in mobility in US counties in high and low social capital communities

Results presented in Figure 1 do not consider differences across counties with different levels of social capital which may also shape behavioural responses during the pandemic. In Figure 2, we highlight the weekly evolution in mobility differentials across counties that are associated with a one standard deviation difference in social capital after accounting for county-level characteristics (weather conditions, the number of COVID-19 cases diagnosed the week before, if the county was subject to shelter-in-place orders in the week under analysis, the percentage of votes cast that were in favour of Trump in the 2016 presidential elections, the primary economic activity of the county, population density, the share of people over 65, and the share of people living in poverty) as well as state fixed effects.

Figure 2 Social capital differentials in mobility between 17 February and 10 May in the US

Notes: The balanced panel covers 2715 counties which account for 96% of the total US population in 2018. All models are based on Cuebiq Mobility trends data. Dependent variable: mobility index. The figure highlights the change in mobility associated with a one standard deviation difference in social capital while accounting for weather conditions (precipitations), the number of covid-19 cases diagnosed the week before, if the county was subject to shelter-in-place orders in the week, the percentage of votes cast that were in favour of Trump in the 2016 presidential elections, the economic dependence of the county (reference category undifferentiated economic activity), population density, the share of people over 65, and the share of people in poverty.

Figure 2 illustrates the average within state, between county variation in mobility between 17 February and 10 May that is associated with a difference of one standard deviation in social capital. It indicates that the social capital differential in mobility became very large between March and 13 April and decreased from 13 April on but remained statistically significant. This result should be considered in light of Figure 1: at the start of the study period the differential occurred while levels of mobility were declining while at the end of the study period the differential occurred when overall mobility levels were increasing. Crucially, the social capital differential grew before shelter-in-place orders were implemented.

Because behavioural changes in the early stages of COVID-19 are crucial to halt the spread of the virus before cases start to rise exponentially (Dave et al. 2020) these findings are particularly relevant. They also indicate that although sheltering-in-place orders can effectively alter individual behaviours across all communities, they are especially effective in communities with high levels of social capital.

In order to evaluate the likely risk different communities face because of COVID-19 we combine information on community-level social capital and the prevalence of chronic conditions such as diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, lung disease, and heart disease in the population. Individuals with pre-existing conditions are in fact more likely to face complications if infected with COVID-19 (Jordan 2020). We consider counties with a high prevalence of chronic conditions and low levels of social capital to be very vulnerable while counties with a low prevalence of chronic conditions and high levels of social capital to have low levels of vulnerability. Figure 3 indicate that many counties, particularly in the Southeast, face very high levels of vulnerability, combining high rates of chronic conditions and low levels of social capital.

Sources: Author’s calculations based on data from www.policymap.com (risk index) and “The geography of social capital” (social capital index).

Our findings may be important not only to evaluate what happened in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, but also to consider where efforts should be put as legal barriers to the SARS-CoV-2 virus are relaxed. Governments around the world have lifted some of the restrictions to movement that were implemented in February and March 2020 when the number of COVID-19 cases rapidly increased. Our work suggests that the stock of social capital in a community is a crucial factor. Reinforcing the social capital available in a community when this is present and supporting communities when social capital is lacking should be just as much of a priority as sourcing stocks of face masks or testing kits to protect population health.

2020-06-10||Southland Stags player Scott Eade is the host of a new podcast that looks at all things rugby in Southland.

Stags player Scott Eade is shining a spotlight on Southland rugby as the skipper of a new podcast which has quickly attracted a strong fan following.

The 27-year-old has combined with fellow Marist clubmen Jeremy Boyle and UK-based Bryce Morgan to create The Brains Trust rugby pod, which describes itself as a look at all things rugby in the deep south, “a mix of serious footy chat with a bit of banter thrown in”.

At a time when rugby has been little more than a romantic memory and there was even less certainty about when, or even if, the season would get underway, the pod has scratched an itch and attracted about 2500 listeners after just eight episodes.

Not bad for what is a reasonably niche subject.

“We thought we’d just give it a crack and the first couple went alright, and so we’ve just stuck at it,” Eade told SouthlandSport.com.

Eade, who combines his rugby with a role as a development officer with Touch Southland, studied journalism after high school and has an interest in media generally.

He’s also become a fan of the podcast medium and when lockdown provided him with a bit more spare time, the gem of an idea, which he’d had for a while, sprouted.

While working for Rugby Southland as the union’s women’s development officer, Eade had seen the decline in club rugby coverage and began thinking about ways the void could be filled.

“We’ve had a few messages from people who know us or have enjoyed hearing about club footy. There’s quite a few boys who are from Southland but are living in Aussie or the UK, it gives them an idea of what’s going on back here,” Eade said.

“I suppose that’s given myself and now Jeremy and Bryce the motivation to keep going with it. Now that we are about to start the season, it will be good to get into some weekly wraps and get some guys on from different clubs and teams.”

Despite letting itself down somewhat with its unashamed green-and-black bias – full disclosure, I am a Blues supporter – the podcast has struck a delightful balance between the humourous, eg, the selection of a Southland all-time under 85kg team, and the serious, eg. the always contentious debate around the value of the Eastern-Northern Barbarians concept.

Another interesting recent debate centred around whether the standard of club rugby in Southland had declined over the past 20 years.

“When we started, we talked about the fact people don’t just want to listen to serious stuff,” Eade said.

“We have a bit of a laugh about things, but we don’t shy away from polarising topics. We had Ben McKerchar on last week, and he’s never short of a word. We knew that he would give his honest opinion.”

Another strength of a longer-form platform like a podcast is that it creates the time and space to develop a deeper story, as the Brains Trust has done with in-depth interviews with current and former Stags players Javaan Fa’amoe Ioane and Liam Howley.

It’s a chance to let the subject tell their own story, something that’s hard to encapsulate in 500 words.

The podcast has also provided Eade with a rugby outlet at a time when he’s desperately needed one.

His 2019 season came to an abrupt end at a Stags training run when he dislocated his shoulder so badly he had to go to hospital to get it put back in.

Surgery and then a long rehab followed. With the club season beckoning, Covid-19 stepped up and changed the game again.

“It’s felt like forever, to be fair, especially for me because I did my shoulder right back at the start of September last year. I was just in the process of getting back into playing and then [the pandemic] happened,” Eade said.

“There was that period when we weren’t even sure if we were going to play club and there were murmurs that there might not be a Mitre 10 Cup, or that Southland wouldn’t be in it. It’s exciting to be back with the Marist boys and just chucking a ball around really.”

Marist will take on Woodlands in a preseason game this weekend, another tangible sign that some sort of normality is returning to the Southland way of life.

Eade isn’t expecting to take over the world with the Brains Trust, but he’s interested to see where it goes next.

“I don’t really have any expectations of it getting too big, or anything. It was more just about entertaining people who have an interest in Southland rugby, want to listen to a few yarns and get an idea of what’s going on,” he said.

“We’ll just keep plugging away and hopefully a few people tune in.”

2020-06-11||Bullish sentiment appears to have returned to the stock markets with a vengeance. In a historic rally that has taken even die-hard bulls by surprise, the S&P 500 has managed to claw back all of its 2020 losses, taking just 53 sessions for the index to fully restore the nearly $10T in value it shed in an epic bear market.

The oil markets have been nearly as impressive.

After entering negative territory for the first time in history, U.S. WTI prices have briefly touched $40/bbl amid record production cuts and an uptick in global demand. Oil and gas stocks have doubled from their March 23 nadir, marking a sharp reversal from the precipitous drop that wiped out nearly two decades of gains.

There’s no shortage of bottom fishing opportunities in this market, with shares of bankrupt or near-bankrupt shale companies including Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL), Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), California Resources Corp. (NYSE:CRC) and Valaris Plc (NYSE: VAL) as well as offshore drillers Borr Drilling Ltd (NYSE:BORR), Noble Corp.(NYSE:NE), Seadrill (NYSE:SDRL) and TransOcean (NYSE:RIG) recording triple-digit gains over the past week alone.

But analysts are now saying investors need to pump their brakes.

A cross-section of Wall Street has warned that there’s too much irrational exuberance in the markets, and the oil price rally is not fully supported by fundamentals.







Source: CNN Money

According to Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING, as well as analysts at Goldman Sachs, refining margins, aka crack spreads, across different regions around the globe are still way off their norms, portending continuing weak global demand for distillates.

U.S. crack spreads clocked in at a mere $9/bbl last week, compared to $21 at the same time last year according to Reuters, while crack spreads for European diesel dropped to a record low of $2.90.

Related: The True Impact Of COVID-19 On Natural Gas Demand

Crack spreads are a good proxy for oil demand with falling spreads a sign of weak demand and vice-versa. The badly squeezed margins for refiners is a worrying sign that global demand remains way below normal levels, with the ongoing pick-up in crude prices only serving to worsen the margin contraction for the likes of Valero Energy Corp. (NYSE:VLO), Marathon Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:MPC) and Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX).

WTI and Brent prices have staged a strong rally over the past few weeks after production cuts by OPEC+ and independent producers in the U.S. and elsewhere helped ease a huge supply glut and storage buildup. On Saturday, OPEC and its allies agreed to extend the cuts by an additional month with plans to review progress on a monthly basis. Global oil demand particularly in the giant markets of China and India appears to be recovering at a faster-than-expected clip, with crude imports in China surging 13% in May to a record 11.3 million barrels per day and demand back to 90% of pre-crisis levels. Meanwhile, May sales in India were recorded at ~76% of normal levels while U.S. gasoline demand has seen a 7% uptick during the final week of May to clock in at 75% of pre-COVID-19 levels.

But analysts are now questioning whether the rebound in demand is the result of rising consumption or simply the result of refiners and traders stocking up on cheap crude.

ING’s Patterson and Ehsan Khoman at Japanese bank MUFG say the surge in demand could partly be the result of opportunistic buying by refiners. Consequently, Goldman has predicted that Brent prices will pull back to $35 per barrel in the coming weeks from a recent high of $43. According to Bloomberg, the United States’ largest refiner by capacity, Valero Energy, is currently running its two crude units at just 58% of their maximum rate of 424K bbl/day due to low demand and storage filling up. The refinery's fluid catalytic converter as well as all the hydrotreaters except the distillate hydrotreaters are running at minimum rates while rates on the coker have also been lowered. In a previous article, we reported that giant oil traders have been storing millions of barrels of crude in the seas with a view to selling when prices improve in the coming months, which could also be driving the surge in demand. At this juncture, it’s best for investors to adopt an attitude of cautious optimism. On one hand, the bulls argue that OPEC+ has curtailed production too fast, with some oil executives eyeing the seemingly untouchable WTI prices of $70 in the current year. On the other hand, poor refining margins are telling a different story while oil prices have, worryingly, been strongly pulling back from recent highs on fears that increased production by U.S. shale producers and Libya will offset the OPEC+ cuts. As many analysts have pointed out, the biggest wild card in this market remains the speed at which demand is going to bounce back in the coming months. The current evidence though appears to lend support to the bull camp.||1
2020-06-11||The nationwide protests against police brutality and systemic racism have caused many long-standing American institutions to look inward and figure out how they can do the bare minimum to support the cause. The Marines have ordered the removal of Confederate flags from their bases; the Army has expressed openness to the idea of renaming bases named after Confederate generals; and now, the Navy has joined in with its own performative gesture .

CNN reports that an order is being crafted to ensure the removal of all Confederate iconography from Navy institutions. “The Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Mike Gilday, has directed his staff to begin crafting an order that would prohibit the Confederate battle flag from all public spaces and work areas aboard Navy installations, ships, aircraft and submarines,” Cmdr. Nate Christensen, Gilday’s spokesperson, said in a statement.



Initially, U.S. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley expressed openness to holding bipartisan discussions to rename approximately a dozen military bases named after Confederate generals—b ut President Trump shut that shit down with the quickness, though. In a series of tweets sent out Wednesday, the president said: “my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations…”

If I seem cynical about these moves, well, that’s because I am. While these are cute gestures, until the military makes active efforts to combat white nationalism within its ranks, the gestures will ring hollow. Last year, a measure designed to combat white nationalism in the armed forces had the phrase “white nationalism” removed. In March, an active duty member of the Army plotted with a white nationalist to bomb a Kansas City hospital as the COVID-19 pandemic intensified. There’s a clear problem here that the military just seems content to ignore.||1
2020-06-11||Shubhangi, congratulations, you just defended your PhD, what was it on?

“I looked at how the active ingredients in drugs form crystals in liquids. Crystallisation is important for making and formulating many medicines, and I looked at the first step in the formation of these crystals, where I analysed how these molecules of the drug’s active ingredient cluster together.

What did it involve?

I did lots of experiments, thousands of them. I measured the size of molecular clusters of various active pharmaceutical ingredients, which changed with time due to clustering in different liquids under different conditions. It involved lots of calculations from those experiments too.

It is fundamental science, rather than applied, but the applications depend on knowing the fundamental science, so what I found should be helpful for industry.

How did you come to study that?

I did a primary degree and a master’s degree in nanotechnology in India, then I worked in Karlsruhe in Germany. I wanted to do a PhD, and was looking for projects online. I saw this one advertised in Limerick, so I applied, and I went out of my workplace to an internet cafe and did an online interview with Prof Åke Rasmuson in the department of chemical sciences at UL.

What was the toughest challenge of doing a PhD?

I think it was writing up the thesis. In one way, it was good timing because I wrote up a lot of it during the lockdown restrictions for Covid-19, so I didn’t feel I was missing out on a social life and I could get up late in the morning and work right through until after midnight, which suits me. Even still, the writing was challenging, but I think it really helped me to get a deeper understanding of my PhD, I needed to go through that.

Because of Covid-19, you did your PhD defence, or viva, online. How did that work?

Normally a PhD viva takes place in a room, where you have your professor and examiners present. But we couldn’t do that now because of Covid, so we did the viva over Skype. I was in Limerick, and my professor was in Sweden and my external examiner was in France and there were other examiners on the call too. I did a presentation and then the examiners asked me questions.

How did you feel before the PhD viva? I did mine 23 years ago, and I can still recall the terrifying pre-exam nerves!

I was really nervous. I couldn’t sleep the night before. I had prepared well for my presentation, but I felt like I was a different person presenting it, and then I had to answer the questions. It is a long exam, it takes hours, and I was very relieved when it was over.

What was the high point of the exam?

I think it was when they told me at the end that my presentation was excellent, that I got my PhD and that I didn’t have to make any corrections to my project. That means I can relax a bit!

Now that you have finished, what will you do for the next few months?

I had planned to go home and visit my family in India as I have not seen them for a year and a half, but I can’t go because of Covid. So I am going to apply for post-doctoral positions and jobs, and see what comes down the road next.”||2
2020-06-11||Once Hertz declared bankruptcy, the rental car company pushed a ton of their inventory onto the used car market. While some industry experts predicted this would cause a blow to used car values, prices have started to stabilize a little, but according to iSeeCars.com, you can still score some great deals buying from Hertz.

Millions of Americans are feeling the negative economic impact of Covid-19, and while states are slowly opening up and folks are returning to work, it’s hard to make up for lost income. Buyers that are in the market for a car would be wise to pivot to a cheaper pre-owned car. Indeed many car shoppers are doing just that, as the used car market is bouncing back while new car sales still lag. If you’re looking for a deal, buying from a rental fleet like Hertz could be a good move.

According to iSeeCars, vehicles in the Hertz fleet can often be a bit cheaper than the average market price for a similar used car.

iSeeCars analyzed over 20,000 used cars from model years 2017 to 2019 listed by Hertz Car Sales® in May 2020, to see which vehicles provide the biggest cost savings. Hertz vehicles can currently be found on average for $1,389 below market value, which is 43.3 percent more than the average discount for Hertz vehicles in April at $969. Some vehicles can be found with savings far greater than average.

However, the cars with the best savings seem to be luxury models, which may not be the right fit for budget-focused shoppers.

You might be surprised to see such low miles on excellent cars like the BMW 7 series or the Infiniti QX50, but renters don’t tend pay for the upgrade for a premium ride. Renting a car is generally just about getting there and getting back for most people.

Here is a sampling of 2019 740 models all with reasonable mileage for a rental car.



Considering the 7 series had a starting price of around $84,000 before options picking up a one-year-old example with plenty of warranty left for almost half-price is a heck of a value.

Hertz’s no-haggle price and return policy can ease the stress of shopping, especially in the more challenging, affordable segment (around $15,000), where dealers will play games and add fees in order to squeeze whatever they can out of the customer.

2020-06-11||I , Jean-Paul Sartre, everything is complicated by the presence of the other team. Pierre Nkurunziza had ways of simplifying things. Burundi’s president, who died on June 8th, would travel with his football team, Hallelujah . At matches opponents would shy away from tackles. Some who did not were arrested—a terrifying experience in Mr Nkurunziza’s police state.

The despot’s foul play was apparent off the pitch, too. He became president in 2005, at the end of a civil war, ushering in hope that the country of 11m people could, like neighbouring Rwanda, enjoy some stability. But in 2015, at the end of his term limit, Mr Nkurunziza refused to go. His obstinacy set off tit-for-tat violence, assassinations, a failed coup and the displacement of 400,000 people.

“People hate him,” says a journalist in the country. “During his reign so many people died.” Mr Nkurunziza’s regime murdered and tortured opponents. Corruption and punitive taxes have further impoverished Burundians, 72% of whom live on less than the equivalent of $1.90 per day.

The president agreed not to run for a fourth term in elections in May. Instead he agreed to a new job title: Paramount Leader, Champion of Patriotism and Leadership Core. The vote was rigged in favour of Évariste Ndayishimiye, who is not scheduled to take office until August. Pascal Nyabenda, the speaker of the national assembly and Mr Nkurunziza’s first choice as successor, should fill in as interim president.

Mr Nkurunziza had wanted to run the country from behind the scenes. Now possible rivalry between an interim president and the president-elect could create instability. Then there is the regional picture. Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda have long waged proxy wars in eastern Congo. A power vacuum in Burundi presents a chance for further meddling in its affairs.

The president’s death may, though, allow the country to face up to another pressing issue. He ignored covid-19 and turfed out experts from the World Health Organisation, saying that God would protect Burundi. This may have been his downfall. The government says he died of a heart attack, but local sources whisper that he succumbed to covid-19. His wife was reportedly in Kenya for treatment. His death gives Burundi a chance to tackle the pandemic—and, perhaps, of a bit less foul play. ■||1
2020-06-11||Public debt has risen to unprecedented peacetime levels, due to policies put into place to address the economic fallout from COVID-19. Nevertheless, as this column reveals, the Centre for Macroeconomics panel was nearly unanimous that the Treasury should not take any action to decrease the deficit in the upcoming budget. The panel is split on when it would be wise to publicly announce long-run plans to address the deficit and the debt. The majority of the panel supports a mix of financing options when action is taken, with tax increases receiving strong support and not a single panellist supporting public spending cuts.

The UK government has supported the economy with a variety of measures in response to the COVID-19 crisis. This has led to an unprecedented increase in public deficits in peacetime. The Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts a budget deficit of £300 billion this year, more than 15% of UK GDP. Public debt is expected to exceed 100% of GDP by the end of the year. Despite this increased borrowing, the UK government is borrowing at negative rates for horizons of up to three years and can currently borrow at 50-year maturities for less than half a percent annually.

Internal Treasury documents indicate that the Exchequer has begun planning measures to reduce the deficit in upcoming years. Goodhart and Pradhan (2020) predict rising inflation if public and private debts aren’t addressed. Others have suggested that it is premature to take action or even commence planning for deficit reduction. Nick Macpherson, a former top Treasury official, said: “You don’t want to have a Budget while the crisis is in full throttle.” Paul Johnson of the Institute of Fiscal Studies suggests waiting until the end of 2021, “once we have a better idea how well the economy has recovered.” The Economist has also opined that “rich-world governments will make a big mistake if they succumb to premature and excessive worries about budgets.”

In this month’s CfM survey, panellists were asked about the urgency of deficit reduction and how this deficit reduction should be achieved.

Question 1 How urgently should the UK government address the rise in public debt?

Thirty panellists responded to this question. The panel was nearly unanimous (one dissent) that no measures should be taken in the upcoming budget. The vast majority of the panel (63%) stated that there was no need to take any action or announce budgetary changes to address public debt until the pandemic subsided. The remaining panellists were split on whether the government should present concrete plans sooner rather than later (20%) or that focus on the public debt was counterproductive (13%).

Uncertainty on the scale and duration of the pandemic and its economic consequences was the main argument for postponing the discussion on public debt. David Cobham (Heriot-Watt University) thinks it “[b]est to wait until some of the dust at least has settled, otherwise we can't see what we're doing.” Thorsten Beck (Cass Business School) elaborated that at this stage, “it is not even clear how long the pandemic will last and how many waves there will be and what the ultimate economic cost will be.” Panellists furthermore didn’t see room for concern that requires immediate action. Wouter Den Haan (London School of Economics) notes that “we know countries like the UK can deal with high debt levels and right now there are obviously more important concerns.” Some participants, like John Van Reenen (London School of Economics) views austerity during the global financial crisis as a mistake, from which we should now learn.

Those supporting long-term plans raised concerns that ignoring the deficit entirely would create uncertainty that might hamper the recovery. Ricardo Reis (London School of Economics) notes that “having a clear long-term plan for fiscal policy would anchor expectations. It would remove one of the usually bigger sources of uncertainty for investment.” Kate Barker (British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme) suggests that instead of a plan, “HMT should introduce a few measures but launch a consultation on the pace of deficit reduction and tax and spend measures.” She also notes that this would be an opportunity to address some longer-term challenges: “The National Infrastructure Statement is needed to help with recovery and the way forward on climate change. And it would be very appropriate for a proper policy on social care finally to get the priority it deserves.” While only 20% of panellists supported long-term plans to address the deficit, a few supporters of the majority view implied in their comments that long-term fiscal plans would be wise.

The minority opposing plans to address the public debt in the foreseeable future instead expressed concern that excessive focus on the public debt would come at the expense of aiding the recovery. Simon Wren-Lewis (University of Oxford), for example, opposes any budgetary deficit reduction unless interest rates begin to rise. Wendy Carlin (University College London) also asked that the discussion be shifted from public debt concerns to “minimizing the damage to education, R&D, investment, start-ups etc. and on supporting incomes until economic activity can resume.”

A debate has emerged on financing methods for the massive increases in government debt worldwide. The most direct way to reduce deficits is by cutting public spending or increasing tax revenues. The Treasury’s internal estimates suggest that freezing public sector pay for two years would lead to savings of £6.5 billion by 2023-24. The Social Market Foundation points to the generous indexing of public pensions (the triple lock) as an attractive target for spending reductions. Although the Conservative Party manifesto promised no increases in income, VAT, or National Insurance taxes, the Treasury is contemplating tax hikes. The Chancellor has indicated that the crisis might be an opportunity to increase self-employment National Insurance tax rates to better align with those of wage earners. The Labour manifesto called for wealth taxation even prior to the pandemic, although support for such measures from Labour’s new leadership is yet to be seen. The Financial Times provides a useful summary and a podcast on the panoply of budgetary measures that could be used to reduce the public debt.

Debt reduction efforts following WWII point to other debt reduction strategies. Public debts of high-income countries eroded through a combination of higher inflation and artificially low interest rates supported by regulatory measures such as capital controls (financial repression). A number of commentators have advocated a return to these practices. Adam Tooze points to these historical experiences and proposes direct monetary financing of deficits: “Under ordinary circumstances one might worry about that causing inflation. But given the recession we face that is a risk worth running. Indeed modest inflation would help us by taking a bite out of the real value of the debt.” Willem Buiter has suggested that increasing inflation targets to 5% would do the trick, but notes little appetite for such policies in high-income countries.

Following the Napoleonic Wars, the UK took a different approach of issuing consols (or perpetual bonds). The US took a similar approach following the Civil War and the UK issued some consols following WWI. These are bonds that never mature, but whose coupons are serviced indefinitely. George Soros has advocated issuing consols to address COVID-19-related public debt and the Spanish government has proposed these debt instruments as a way to finance recovery efforts in the euro area (see also Giavazzi and Tabellini 2020 and Verhofstadt and Garicano’s April 15 editorial; Corsetti et al. 2020 argue against these instruments). Current yields on UK bonds are at unprecedented lows.

Economic growth could reduce the deficit and debt as a share of GDP, but it is unclear which policies would guarantee higher economic growth in current circumstances.

In this regard, the CfM panel was asked:

Question 2 What is the best way to (eventually) reduce public deficits and debt?

Thirty panellists responded to this question. Many respondents supported a policy mix that involves more than one of the proposed policies. Several respondents expressed hopes that economic growth would do its share in reducing the effective size of the public debt. In ranking individual policies, respondents were nearly equally split between those supporting tax increases and those supporting the issuance of perpetual bonds, with 30% support for each, although supporters of tax increases expressed greater confidence. A smaller share (13%) supported higher inflation. Not a single panellist expressed support for public spending increases (or financial repression).

Supporters of tax increases noted that the UK public sector, whose importance the COVID-19 crisis has further underlined, has been stretched for some time. Tony Yates (University of Birmingham) argues that “a larger and more resilient state is likely to be needed to put us in a better position to fight future pandemics, and also to redress some for the regressive aspects of them.” Jagjit Chadha (National Institute of Economic and Social Research) notes that “we have a sustained increase in the demand for the provision of public goods.” Kate Barker (British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme) suggests that higher taxation might be necessary to support the economic recovery. She writes: “There is a high risk that the better-off will continue to save more - taxing in order to support demand may be important - and in the longer run part of the deficit reduction.” Andrew Mountford (Royal Holloway) suggested specific tax measures, including “property tax as the most efficient way to do so and to use the revenues not only for debt reduction but also for substantial public investments.”

2020-06-11||Northern Ireland’s health minister, Robin Swann, has criticised the Government in Dublin for its failure to keep the Executive in Belfast informed of its plan for easing lockdown restrictions. He has a point.

This has been a recurring problem. After First Minister Arlene Foster complained rather justifiably that she and her colleagues had learned of the Republic’s lockdown plans through the media, and amidst concerns about the divergent approaches to the pandemic on both sides of the Border, the authorities in Dublin and Belfast were eager to show determination to coordinate better.

In April a Memorandum of Understanding was agreed between North and South which recognised a “compelling case for strong co-operation, including information-sharing and, where appropriate, a common approach”. When the Government announced its accelerated roadmap last Friday, it said the Executive was informed in advance. But this appears to have been no more than a courtesy call.

The authorities in Northern Ireland made serious errors early on in the pandemic. Some, such as the failure to carry out community testing and set up a contact tracing system, were the result of a policy reliance on London, whose approach to the pandemic has been muddled and chaotic. But important strides have been made since then.

A rapprochement between Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill produced a useful model that reflected Northern Ireland’s own needs. The compromise was that the DUP accepted a plan closer to the Republic than to Britain, while Sinn Féin accepted the principle of a bespoke plan for the North. No deaths from coronavirus have been reported in the North in four days.

We are in a dangerous moment, reopening society while the virus still circulates among us. Radically differing approaches North and South would leave everyone on the island more vulnerable. If the Government means what it says about the importance of cross-Border coordination, then it should make a genuine effort to work with the Executive.||1
2020-06-11||The Australian dollar was the greatest beneficiary of renewed risk appetite overnight, as US equity markets were buoyed by the FOMC’s dovish monetary policy statement. The AUD has round-tripped from 0.6980 to touch 11-month highs of 0.7063 before retreating into this mornings’ open with the pair currently oscillating around the 0.7000 handle. Despite the NZD also benefiting from the risk rally, AUD/NZD was able to rise from 1.0680 to 1.0730 overnight.

With the AUD/USD’s tight correlation with global equity markets still intact, the Aussie’s rally was largely unsurprising as the FED’s dovish monetary policy statement stimulated US equities. The US central bank left the policy rate unchanged at 0%-0.25%, delivered lower inflation and growth forecasts and made no mention of slowing down its policy stimulus even as equity markets rally.

Thursday is set to be a pretty quiet day. On the data front, we have MI inflation expectations for June on the domestic docket before retail card spending across the pond. Neither of which are expected to be market movers. Attentions will then turn the May PPI and jobless claims out of the world’s largest economy. Given the AUD/USD’s current consolidation around the 70c mark, a continuation of the Aussie’s recent uptrend could see it test 0.7080 on the topside whilst downside moves are expected to meet initial resistance at 0.6989.

As we touched on above, the major story overnight was the dovish monetary policy statement from the FOMC. The worlds largest economy opted to maintain its current monetary policy stance, continue its COVID 19 stimulus packages and lowered its CPI and growth forecasts. The moves translated into a weaker USD in currency markets, allowing the EUR, GBP and JPY to all rise against the greenback.

The EUR was able to break through the 1.14 mark overnight as it rose from 1.345 to 1.1422, representing a three-month high. The sterling also broke through 1.28 with USD/JPY falling to trade below 107.

Global markets will be looking towards the US may PPI and initial jobs claims numbers which are due out tonight before attentions turn to Friday’s session. Friday delivers Industrial production data out of New Zealand, Japan, the UK and the Eurozone. WE will also see UK GDP and trade balance data for April before US consumer confidence and JOLTS jobs data for April to round out the week.

2020-06-12||The cost of staying open: Voluntary social distancing and lockdowns in the US

Lockdown policies have been found to be effective in promoting social distancing and slowing down the spread of COVID-19. Yet, such measures are often blamed for downturns in the economy. This column argues that the lockdowns in the US are in fact efficient in minimising the costs of the epidemic, once both the economic and medical burden that would arise in the absence of such policies are considered. Estimates from a controlled SIR model, which includes the possibility for changes in behaviour, suggest that lockdowns reduce the costs of the pandemic by at least 1.7% of annual GDP compared to a no-lockdown scenario.

With few exceptions, governments around the world have implemented lockdown policies in order to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Public debates over the costs of such measures have typically assumed that the extent to which populations socially distance, and the associated economic costs, are mostly within the government's control. What is largely missing in these debates, however, is the recognition that the economic costs of the pandemic will be substantial even in the absence of lockdowns, since the spread of the virus causes a significant increase in voluntary social distancing (Chudik et al. 2020, Brzezinski et al. 2020a). This suggests that the counterfactual additional costs of a lockdown might be lower than commonly assumed.

Indeed, in a recent paper (Brzezinski et al. 2020b), we find that lockdown policies have been economically more efficient than staying open in the US. To obtain these results, we combine microeconometric methods with an epidemiological model that allows for societal and political response to the virus in order to estimate the costs and benefits of lockdown policies.

Our argument builds on two pillars:
• First, we find that the additional economic costs due to lockdowns are relatively low, once accounting for the voluntary response that would occur in the absence of such policies. This is in line with forecasts for 2020, which predict similar contractions in most developed countries (European Commission 2020) even if they did not impose lockdown measures, like Sweden. It also aligns with earlier research that showed credit card consumption only marginally less in Sweden, than in neighbouring Denmark, which did lock down (Andersen et al. 2020). Research on unemployment data from the US further suggests that only one fourth of the claims has been caused by lockdowns (Baek et al. 2020).
• Second, the medical benefits of a lockdown are high because of the high hospitalisation rate of COVID-19. Taken together, our findings indicate that lockdown measures generate efficiency gains in terms of medical expenditures that offset the comparatively small economic losses caused by lockdown policies.

We leverage daily county-level mobile phone data on movement patterns to study the impact of local outbreaks and lockdown policies on mobility. These data are considered crucial in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 (Oliver et al. 2020) and have been used in a wide range of applications (Allcott et al. 2020, Andersen 2020).

Our events of interest are the first county-level case and state-level stay-at-home orders issued over the course of March and April 2020. These allow us to estimate the voluntary and lockdown responses to an outbreak, respectively.[1] Due to the gradual occurrence of these events across the US, we are able to construct viable counterfactual scenarios using difference-in-differences designs. Our outcome variable of interest is the percentage of devices that stay home all day.

Figure 1 shows the estimated uptake in social distancing following the first COVID-19 case by state. The horizontal line indicates the estimated coefficient for the US as a whole, while the points correspond to state-specific estimates. Overall, the share of people that stayed home all day increased by around 1.8 percentage points in the US. This constitutes an increase of 5.1% compared to February 2020. As reduced mobility maps into lower economic activity, this implies that economic costs are inevitable even in the absence of lockdown measures.

Notes: The figure plots the difference-in-differences estimate for the change in the percentage of devices that stay completely at home following the first case in a county. Blue (red) lines correspond to Democratic (Republican) states as per the 2016 presidential election; dashed lines indicate parameters that are insignificant at p<0.05; confidence level: 95%.

This substantial uptake in social distancing is comparable in magnitude to citizens' response to lockdown orders. Using a similar approach, our results show that the additional lockdown-induced impact on social distancing is 5.3%. Thus, governments that rely solely on voluntary social distancing need to take into account that the behavioural change will be significantly smaller without a lockdown policy in place, but will nonetheless still lead to sizeable decreases in activity.

How do these patterns in social distancing map into medical and economic costs? We answer this question by studying a controlled SIR model (Gros et al. 2020) (the acronym stands for Susceptible – Infected – Recovered). In addition to the standard epidemiological SIR model, this framework introduces the possibility for changes in behaviour, such as social distancing, which influence the rate at which the virus reproduces. This additional parameter can be interpreted as the joint social and political effort to promote social distancing and therefore to mitigate the spread of the virus. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the model allows us to split the reaction strength into the components related to voluntary and mandated social distancing. Then, based on the previously estimated coefficients, we simulate the outbreak for both a lockdown and a no-lockdown scenario.

Based on these simulations, we separately estimate the economic and medical costs arising from the pandemic. The medical costs are composed of the production loss due to infected workers going on sick leave and the medical expenses associated with infections. These costs are directly proportional to the number of infections over the course of the pandemic.[2] The economic costs depend negatively on the degree of social distancing, which can be measured by the relative decrease in the reproduction number. Overall, the model reflects the trade-off faced by governments between balancing medical and economic costs. Less-restrictive policies increase medical costs through the total number of infected individuals, while lowering the burden from reduced economic activity.

The medical and economic cost estimates are presented in Figure 2 for a selection of US states that imposed lockdowns. It shows the costs in terms of GDP per capita associated with the estimated total containment response (T) and the counterfactual voluntary response (V).[3] For the US as a whole, we estimate that COVID-19 generates costs of around 13.9% of annual GDP per capita under a laissez-faire scenario compared to 12.2% if a lockdown is imposed.[4] In other words, imposing a country-wide lockdown would reduce the loss incurred by as much as 1.7% over the course of the pandemic compared to a no-lockdown scenario.

The finding that lockdowns are efficient in lowering the overall costs holds consistently across all states considered.[5] Decreasing the measured containment response by lifting a lockdown would only marginally increase the economic costs, while at the same time drastically increasing the medical costs. This pattern is more pronounced in states where the overall containment response was insufficiently effective, such as New York, Delaware and Massachusetts. In these states, voluntary social distancing leads to relatively larger decreases in economic costs compared to states with more efficient containment responses such as Vermont and New Mexico. Yet, the small reductions in economic activity are more than outweighed by the much larger relative increases in medical costs.

Notes: The figure shows estimated costs under voluntary social distancing (V) compared to total social distancing (T) – which includes voluntary (V) and lockdown-induced reductions (L) in movement. Estimated costs for (T) are based on simulations of the discretized C-SIR model. Costs for (V) are re-estimated with α scaled by the estimated ratio V/(V+L) = V/T. Costs are in terms of GDP per capita. Costs for both (V) and (T) are broken down into economic (red) and medical (blue).

We provide evidence for the efficiency of lockdown policies in mitigating both the overall costs to the economy as well as the spread of COVID-19. The reason for this is that individuals engage in voluntary social distancing even in the absence of lockdowns, once the virus takes hold in their area. Hence, substantial economic costs are unavoidable, even when not locking down. Yet, the additional lockdown-induced social distancing plays an important role in preventing further medical costs. Indeed, for our estimates of the voluntary and mandated social distancing responses, all US states that imposed a lockdown would have incurred larger overall costs had they stayed open. Considering the correct counterfactual costs is therefore key in informing policy decisions during potential future waves of COVID-19.

2020-06-12||After my grant application was rejected, I needed something to cheer me up. I found it in three crucial words in the ‘Going to work’ section of the UK government’s catchily titled document ‘Staying alert and safe (social distancing)’, published on 11 May. The words in question were “and scientific research”. They signalled the phased lifting of some aspects of lockdown in England; specifically, they paved the way for a limited return to work for scientists who work in wet laboratories and cannot work from home.

The priority for reopening the laboratory is ensuring that it is safe for everyone. My lab is lucky to have experience in assessing the risk of infection from viral pathogens because we work with them routinely — admittedly from a safety cabinet and in full personal protective equipment. Importantly, each person’s final decision on whether to go into the lab is down to that individual, and no one is under any pressure to return. The riskiest part of reopening isn’t found in the lab at all: it is the use of public transport, where people are in much closer contact, to get to the lab.

Coronavirus and COVID-19: Keep up to date

I’m excited about the prospect of the lab reopening, even at reduced capacity. I would very much like to return to doing new science now. We have exciting questions that I want to answer: does Sophie’s vaccine work, will Emily’s wonder-drug kill all microbes, will David’s DNA do the deal, is Katie’s RNA stable? And there are numerous side projects and collaborations that, if I had some time, I could restart.

However, not every research scientist across the country will be able to come back immediately. For parents and caregivers in the United Kingdom, until schools and nurseries reopen for all children, it is going to be extremely difficult to physically return to work.

Getting labs up and running again will not be immediate, especially for those that were completely shuttered. Experiments take time to coax back to life. In this respect, my group is in a slightly different situation, because we are not returning to an empty lab. We share space with Robin Shattock, an immunologist at Imperial College London, and his amazing team, who have been leading the charge on one of the United Kingdom’s COVID-19 vaccine candidates. People have been in the lab continually, working at a sensible, safe distance from each other. On the two occasions that I have been back, the lab looked more or less the same as it did before. Even more importantly, Charlie in the molecular-diagnostics lab has, between developing and running COVID-19 detection tests, coaxed my lemon tree back to life.

What does reopening more of the lab mean for me personally? As someone who didn’t spend a significant proportion of their time in the lab, it will not lead to much change. I can do most of my job from home, so am condemned to do so. It certainly doesn’t mean an instant return to pre-2020 work practices, as evidenced by the fact that I wrote the first draft of this from my allotment, while loosely childminding, and not from my office at Imperial, while loosely supervising. Getting back to normal will be a very long process.

For those of you returning imminently, I can share some of my experiences of the limited return to work I have made. On the occasions I’ve returned to the lab, one of the things I have noticed is anxiety. It is like the beginning of the school year after a long summer holiday: will I still know what I am doing, will people still like me, will I still like them, will I remember not to call the teacher mummy? The easiest way around this anxiety is to jump straight in and get to grips with the matter in hand. Being busy is one of the best ways to stop overthinking. If need be, do a small, simple experiment just to blow away the cobwebs of imposter syndrome.

The reopening of some lab activity does mean that, in the United Kingdom, we are moving to a different phase. We are in the end of the beginning. I am not a modeller, so I have no inkling of where this path leads us. There is the distinct possibility that infections will rise again, and we will enter a second cycle of lockdown. I need to manage my own expectations as much as my team’s that, no sooner than picking them up, we might have to down our pipettes again.||2
2020-06-12||The grudging tone emanating from those involved in the talks on government formation and the glacial pace of progress do not auger well for the future of the three-party coalition struggling to be born. The decision of Green Party deputy leader Catherine Martin to challenge Eamon Ryan for the leadership has added another layer of confusion and distrust to a process that was already being regarded with suspicion by a significant number of people in all of the three parties taking part in the process.

There is still some doubt about whether the talks will finally conclude with an agreement this weekend although the general expectation is that they have gone too far to end in failure. Even if there is agreement there is no guarantee that it will be ratified by a two-thirds majority of Green Party members. That will depend to a large degree on whether the party’s 12 TDs give it their enthusiastic backing.

So far a number of them have given the impression that being in coalition with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil is the last place they want to be and a number of people in the other two parties share that sentiment with regard to the Greens. “Even if Eamon Ryan manages to drag the Greens to the altar this has all the signs of a loveless marriage in the making. You have to ask how long it is going to last,” remarked one Fine Gael politician.

The scale of the problems facing the country in the post Covid-19 world will require a government that has the ability to take decisive action which will inevitably generate vociferous opposition from political opponents and constant media criticism. Surviving the pressure will require strong nerves and strong personal bonds between the party leaders as well as a mood of trust among ministers.

Unless a new cabinet is able to unite in a spirit of solidarity behind a programme for government the tensions which have characterised the negotiating process are likely to re-emerge. That is why a bad start will undermine any chance of dealing successfully with the country’s problems, however long the government lasts.

The record of past coalitions may be some guide to the pitfalls that await if one of the parties lacks wholehearted commitment. A classic example is the Fine Gael-Labour coalition of the 1980s led by Garret FitzGerald and Dick Spring which took over the country after the appalling mismanagement of the public finances by Charles Haughey.

From the beginning a significant element of the Labour Party, most notably current President Michael D Higgins and Kildare TD Emmet Stagg, opposed going into coalition and subsequently did everything possible to make life difficult for Spring and his colleagues in government.

Just 18 months into the lifetime of the government Spring almost lost control of his party at its annual conference when he only defeated the anti-coalition faction by 363 votes to 324. Higgins, then party chairman, led the frontal assault denouncing coalition with “the redneck fundamentalists” of Fine Gael.

Having to deal with such inveterate opponents of coalition meant that Spring effectively had one hand tied behind his back and could not agree to the kind of difficult measures that were needed to drag the country out of recession. The diary of Fine Gael minister for education Gemma Hussey gives a flavour of the kind of tensions that beset that government.

When the worsening state of the public finances prompted cuts in food subsidies in the summer of 1984 there was a political storm. “Appalling flack going on about the food subsidies. The hysteria from Michael D Higgins, Joe Higgins of the Labour left, John Carroll [trade union leader], the housewives, you name it, as well as Fianna Fáil’s Michael O’Kennedy being extremely rude on radio. The media are totally gone off mad.”

The miracle of that government was that it managed to survive four years and did have some notable achievements to its credit but it was unable to do what ministers knew needed to be done about the economy. The lesson is that if the Greens go into coalition divided from the start the government will be distracted by interminable internal party wrangling.

A more hopeful example of how a coalition can work well was the three-party coalition of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left that held office from late 1994 until 1997 after the tumultuous events that brought Albert Reynolds crashing down. Many forecast disaster for the only government formed without an election, particularly because of past tensions between taoiseach John Bruton, tánaiste Dick Spring and Democratic Left leader Proinsias De Rossa.

In the event it was a reasonably happy and a successful government which left the country it a better position than it found it with the first budget surplus in a generation. The key to its success was the level of trust between the party leaders and the discipline shown by the TDs of the three parties in keeping the focus on the big issues and refusing to be panicked by every passing storm. If the new government can follow that example it might succeed but it will need to put the difficult birth behind it as quickly as possible.||1
2020-06-13||WASHINGTON - In a move applauded by President Donald Trump’s conservative religious base, his administration on Friday finalized a rule that overturns Obama-era protections for transgender people against sex discrimination in health care.

The Department of Health and Human Services said it will enforce sex discrimination protections “according to the plain meaning of the word ‘sex’ as male or female and as determined by biology.” This rewrites an Obama-era regulation that sought a broader understanding shaped by a person’s internal sense of being male, female, neither or a combination.

LGBTQ groups say explicit protections are needed for people seeking sex-reassignment treatment, and even for transgender people who need care for common illnesses such as diabetes or heart problems.

But conservatives say the Obama administration exceeded its legal authority in broadly interpreting gender.

The reversal comes in the middle of LGBTQ Pride Month. Activists and Democratic lawmakers noted that Friday was also the four-year anniversary of the mass shooting at the Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in which 49 people were killed.

Behind the dispute over legal rights is a medically recognized condition called “gender dysphoria” — discomfort or distress caused by a discrepancy between the gender that a person identifies as and the gender at birth. Consequences can include severe depression. Treatment can range from sex-reassignment surgery and hormones to people changing their outward appearance by adopting a different hairstyle or clothing.

Many social conservatives disagree with the concept.

“Under the old Obama rule, medical professionals could have been forced to facilitate gender reassignment surgeries and abortions — even if they believed this was a violation of their conscience or believed it harmful to the patient,” said Mary Beth Waddell of the religious conservative Family Research Council.

But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, “Religious freedom is no justification for hatred or bigotry, and every American has the right to seek and receive care without intimidation or fear.”

The American Medical Association strongly criticized the Trump administration’s action.

“The federal government should never make it more difficult for individuals to access health care — during a pandemic or any other time,“ said Dr. Susan Bailey, the group’s president.

Under the Obama-era rule, a hospital could be required to perform gender-transition procedures such as hysterectomies if the facility provided that kind of treatment for other medical conditions. The rule was meant to carry out the anti-discrimination section of the Affordable Care Act, which bars sex discrimination in health care but does not use the term “gender identity.”

Women’s groups say the new regulations also undermine access to abortion, which is a legal medical procedure.

“No one should fear being turned away by a medical provider because of who they are or the personal health decisions they have made,” said Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women’s Law Center.

The ACLU says it has already moved to try to prevent the rollback of protections for transgender people. The LGBTQ civil rights group Lambda Legal said it will sue.

More than 1.5 million Americans identify as transgender, according to the Williams Institute, a think-tank focusing on LGBT policy at the UCLA School of Law. A bigger number — 4.5% of the population— identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, according to Gallup.

Roger Severino, head of the HHS unit that enforces civil rights laws, said transgender people continue to be protected by other statutes that bar discrimination in health care on account of race, colour, national origin, age, disability and other factors.

“Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and according to the law,” said Severino. “Our dedication to our civil rights laws is as strong as ever.” He cited recent actions to safeguard access to treatment for disabled people in the coronavirus pandemic.

For the Trump administration it’s the latest in a series of steps to revoke newly won protections for LGBTQ people in areas ranging from the military to housing and education.

The administration also has moved to restrict military service by transgender men and women, proposed allowing certain homeless shelters to take gender identity into account in offering someone a bed for the night, and concluded in a 2017 Justice Department memo that federal civil rights law does not protect transgender people from discrimination at work.

The new rule would also affect the notices that millions of patients get in multiple languages about their rights to translation services. Such notices often come with insurer “explanation of benefits” forms. The Trump administration says the notice requirement has become a needless burden on health care providers, requiring billions of paper notices to be mailed annually at an estimated five-year cost of $2.9 billion.||1
2020-06-13||Principals and deputy principals all around the country are wondering how on earth they are going to re-open their schools at the end of August. While everyone is anxious to facilitate a return to face-to face teaching, the logistics are challenging. Meanwhile, the recent reopening of UK primary schools was a shambles. In the first week, only 52 per cent managed to reopen and only 11 per cent of pupils attended. Several schools reopened and had to close again immediately for deep cleaning because a pupil or teacher was infected.

Irish principals and deputy principals have been working flat out since the lockdown and there is no end in sight. They are currently supervising calculated grades for Leaving Certs, which is an unprecedented pressure even if few parents are attempting to lobby.

Many of them would in other years have the timetable for next year done or mostly done. A normal timetable makes three-dimensional Sudoku look like a snap. Not only is the timetable not ready, but principals have no idea what kind of timetable to formulate.

For example, while it will be very, very difficult for primary schools to reopen, there is one teacher and perhaps a special needs assistant or two per class. In secondary schools with 40-minute class periods, pupils can have nine different teachers in a single day, and no two days of the week are alike. Even in schools with one-hour periods, students will have up to six teachers.

Experts currently believe that, under existing guidelines, schools will only be able to have 50 per cent of their student body in the building at one time.

Some subjects have three periods a week, like history. It is conceivable that if one half of a year is in the school on alternate days, a class might end up with one period in a subject.

The complications do not end there. What about the other half who are at home? There has been vague talk of teachers broadcasting (or more accurately, narrowcasting) their classes as they teach.

How? Teaching is not lecturing. In theory, you could set a camera in a lecture theatre and the lecture could be delivered from one point.

At second level, a teacher talking for 40 minutes or an hour is a very bad class. Students should be active, interacting with the material, each other and the teacher. Good luck with capturing that with one iPad perched on the teacher’s desk.

Schools are not set up to work in this way. They do not have the necessary equipment and some do not even have decent broadband. While online teaching was very demanding and no one wants to go back to it, at least it did not involve engaging with pupils in the classroom while also teaching remotely.

One of the key reasons for going back is to resume productive interaction. Social distancing will make standard classroom strategies like pair work and group work almost impossible. Imagine a migraine-inducing situation where students are merrily yelling at each other from a two-metre distance in the classroom.

Obviously, the 50 per cent who will apparently be at home watching on devices will be very disadvantaged and the pace at which material can be covered will slow to a crawl.

For those in school, what happens at break and lunchtime? Do students stay in a classroom? How do they visit the toilets? Most schools do not have sufficient toilets to allow for queuing in a socially distanced fashion.

I know schools where heating is rationed in the depths of winter because the school cannot afford it. How will they pay for all the additional costs of hand sanitiser, soap, hot water and face masks for staff and so on?

What happens if a teacher or student contracts Covid-19? Teachers and students have underlying conditions, too. Testing and tracing are still not up to speed after months of undelivered promises.

When I wrote recently about my fears for incoming first years, third years and most importantly, sixth years, I was inundated with comments from people annoyed that I had forgotten the particular difficulties facing transition years and second years. Transition year normally involves extensive interaction with the community, for example.

While it is a concession that classroom-based assessments have been modified for third years, much more certainty is needed about what accommodations will be provided for sixth years in terms of adjusted exams and course work.

It already looks like two-metre social distancing is unsustainable for the retail and hospitality industries. I suspect it will be rapidly reduced to one metre and then disappear altogether. (Whether or not that will lead to a second wave of Covid-19 is another day’s work.)

Yet principals and deputies in schools who are already exhausted will spend weeks preparing plans on the basis that social distancing will still exist. Are they supposed to prepare Plan A, Plan B, and Plan C for various contingencies ranging from full social distancing to one metre to none? They will get no break whatsoever. It is poor thanks for all they have given already. They need clear guidance, additional staff and financial assistance. And they need it now.||1
2020-06-13||“It was a good boost to the morale, because the last few months have been pretty difficult,” Morin said.

While COVID-19 restrictions have shut down many restaurants and bars in downtown Billings, Le Fournil was able to operate as a food producer through the closures. The small entryway into the bakery forced Morin to limit one person in the business at a time. The bread is now wrapped in paper sacks, and a plexiglass barrier separates customers and staff. Morin said delivery and curbside pickup have also been available to customers.

But while the new coronavirus added some stress in business operations, the road construction on First Avenue North has been a bigger issue. Curbside pickup hasn’t been available for the past two months as the City of Billings reconstructs parts of the roadway in the area.

“It has affected our business much more than the COVID,” Morin said.

Morin didn’t have much luck when he applied to a few grants to help with operating costs, but he said that it’s better that the money goes to restaurants and other businesses that couldn’t stay open. He’s seen fewer customers compared to the last two years, but the bakery was able to continue operating.||2
2020-06-13||Inflation after the pandemic: Theory and practice

The correlation between monetary growth and inflation has an historic pedigree as long as your arm. This column argues that rejecting the likelihood of (eventually) rising velocity following the current massive monetary expansion requires an alternative theory of inflation that has successfully eluded all of us thus far. Ignoring the potential inflationary dangers is the equivalent to an ostrich putting its head in the sand, and while the path towards disinflation may be well known, it simply isn’t available today.

“Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon in the sense that it is and can be produced only by a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output.” Thus, wrote Milton Friedman in 1970 (The Counter-Revolution in Monetary Theory). And for much of the rest of the last century that doctrine was treated as almost self-evident, and taught in most macroeconomic classes at our universities.

Of course, there are many qualifications, to many of which I contributed in my role as a Bank of England economist at the time. Let us take three such:
• First, the money stock is endogenous (even monetary base in a world where central banks use the short-term interest rate as their primary instrument). While inflation requires monetary growth to facilitate and enable it, it may not be the ultimate cause of that pressure. Using monetary measures alone to offset inflationary, or deflationary, pressures may be somewhat of a blunt instrument, and sometimes with undesirable side-effects, whereas focusing on the treatment of the deeper causes, though in concert with complementary monetary measures, could be preferable.
• Second, there are numerous definitions of monetary growth, and they frequently move in divergent ways.
• Third, and related to the second qualification, the velocity of each, or any, of these can change quite dramatically, even over short periods. An obvious example of the latter is the total collapse of the velocity of M0 in the aftermath of its huge expansion, via quantitative easing, following the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), in some large part because a combination of interest on excess reserves (IOER), regulation and a desire for liquidity moved commercial banks into a liquidity trap, where they were prepared to mop up excess reserves almost without limit, thereby disrupting the transmission mechanism to the broader monetary aggregates and the real economy beyond.

We are, of course, currently in a context where the velocity of broad money is dropping just about as fast as its overall supply is being expanded. This arises from a combination of massive involuntary saving (people cannot go on holiday, attend theatres, buy new clothes, etc.), equivalent falls in the incomes of those supplying such services (offset by various forms of fiscal expansion, such as paid furloughs), and precautionary savings. Yes, indeed, but that will not last. Sometime in the foreseeable future, shops, hotels, even theatres, will reopen and the related workers will be rehired. At this point, velocity will revert back towards normality. And what then?

The correlation between monetary growth and inflation has an historic pedigree as long as your arm. Rejecting the likelihood of (eventually) rising velocity following the current massive monetary expansion requires an alternative theory of inflation that has successfully eluded all of us thus far. Ignoring the potential inflationary dangers is the equivalent to an ostrich putting its head in the sand.

But to mix my metaphors, our typical central bank ostrich has another barrel to their gun. Thus, our typical central bank ostrich will say that, even should there be some resurgence in inflation (and it goes beyond a welcome offset to prior undershoots), “we know how to deal with it”. That position strikes me as an a-historical one, perhaps a consequence of economic history in our universities being relegated to a subsidiary status compared, for example, to mathematical mastery of DSGE models.

Even if the path towards disinflation is well known, it simply isn’t available today. The great difficulties that central banks had in raising interest rates sufficiently to conquer inflation in the 1970s are a stark reminder of the difficulties of lowering inflation. Remember Arthur Burns’ (1979) “Anguish of Central Banking”. It took the alignment of three key people – Steve Axilrod, a master monetary tactician/strategist at the Fed; Paul Volcker, a brave and determined Fed chairman; and Ronald Reagan, an understanding, patient and competent president – to bring off that difficult exercise, and what a difficulty it was! Nominal short-term rates went above 20% and real short-term rates were above 5%; there was a short-sharp recession; many less developed countries got into massive difficulties and almost defaulted; and the global systemically important banks were almost all, on a mark-to-market basis, insolvent. And that was at a time when the debt ratios, both in the public and private sectors, were far, far lower than today. Should we see inflation come back, and become expected – if only for a relatively short period of years – at a time when unemployment is likely to remain quite high and the debt ratios have gone through the roof, with over extended and fragile financial markets, is it really sensible to expect that central banks would be politically and socially allowed to raise interest rates on their own account sufficiently to bring inflation back to target? After all, the vaunted independence of the central bank remains in the gift of each national government, except in the case of the ECB where it is protected by a treaty. But even there, should the ECB try to take back the subsequent inflationary surge by sharply raising interest rates, it would be sensible for the Mayor of Frankfurt to invest in equipment to deter riots and demonstrations.

Indeed, in the context of massive government deficits, and debt ratios rising sharply over 100%, (well over the level of Reinhart and Rogoff feared would normally cause serious economic problems), we may need to rethink how to adjust and protect the concept of central bank independence. A few brave economists have begun to think along such lines (e.g. Bianchi 2020, Cukierman 2020). I happen to believe that there are other and better ways to make such adjustments. But that is for another column.

2020-06-13||China waited more than a week before publishing the genome of the coronavirus in January, an AP investigation claims.

The widow of Li Wenliang, the Chinese doctor who first sounded the alarm about a potential Covid-19 outbreak, has given birth to a son four months after her husband's death.

Doctor Li died aged 33 after contracting the novel coronavirus in February, but first alerted the Chinese authorities to the dangers of the disease back in December 2019.

He was initially ignored by the Chinese government, which played down the threat of the virus after it was first detected in Wuhan. Dr Li was the first person to link the outbreak of the disease to the Huanan seafood market.

Doctor Li's wife, Fu Xuejie, shared an image of her new son on the Chinese social media site WeChat, describing him as a final gift from her late husband.

"Husband, can you see this from heaven? You have given me your final gift today. I will of course love and protect them," Mrs Fu told local news outlet Litchi News. Dr Li, an eye doctor, first noticed the virus after reading a report from a colleague which highlighted a patient who was displaying influenza symptoms, but the disease was proving resistant to conventional treatment. Dr Li noted the problem in a further seven patients and sent a note to fellow doctors alerting them that the virus he had found closely resembled SARS. The SARS outbreak in 2003 claimed 774 lives around the world.

Dr Li was told by local Chinese state police to "stop making false comments". In a note to fellow doctors on WeChat, Dr Li wrote: "The latest news is, it has been confirmed that they are coronavirus infections, but the exact virus strain is being subtyped."

He was a subject of an official investigation along with eight other employees for "spreading rumours". Police warned him that unless he stopped he would be prosecuted. He was forced to sign a statement acknowledging his "misdemeanour" and promising that he would cease from committing future "unlawful acts."

His death in February was greeted with outrage in China. The government was accused of downplaying the severity of the initial outbreak.

Many in China demanded greater freedom of speech following his death, and government censors struggled to delete the avalanche of criticism on sites including WeChat and Weibo.

An internal investigation by Beijing resulted in a formal apology for Dr Li's family and a rare admission of "shortcomings and deficiencies" in their response.

Dr Li has since been labelled a "martyr" by the Chinese state, which makes any public criticism of him a criminal offence.

His wife said that she could not initially tell her other children that their father had died, preferring instead to say that he had "gone abroad".||1
2020-06-13||ST. LOUIS — The city’s plan to spend federal coronavirus relief cash hit a bump this week after confusion delayed an aldermanic bill to approve Mayor Lyda Krewson’s spending plan.

The hiccup started on Thursday after some amendments, though generally agreed upon, confused an aldermanic committee, leading aldermen to hold up the bill. And that meant it missed a reading in front of the full board on Friday.

Krewson’s chief of staff, Steve Conway, said the delay shouldn’t affect the substance of the $64 million emergency measure.

“It doesn’t slow down anything at all,” Conway said.

The city has already started bidding some of the contracts paid for via the pandemic response money, he said.

The measure — which appropriates $35.3 million in funding from the federal CARES Act and close to $30 million from other federal sources — has drawn little dissent from aldermen. Despite the week’s confusion, aldermen have kept funding where Krewson initially proposed spending it when she released her plan for the emergency funds in late May.

Unlike in St. Louis County, where the council opted to give County Executive Sam Page’s administration unfettered authority over the money, the Krewson administration sent aldermen a plan with over 30 line items for spending the relief money. Among the largest spending categories are $8.1 million for testing kits and personal protective equipment, $5.4 million for rent and mortgage relief and $5 million for affordable housing construction.||1

This was a joint effort from the Illinois Soybean Association and Illinois Corn Growers Association.

Officials said the product is made from crops that were grown in Illinois.

"In this COVID situation we wanted a way that we could kind of give back and it's a product that is made with both from corn ethanol and then the glycerin is from the soybean bio-diesel byproduct," said Roberta Simpson-Dolbeare with the Illinois Soybean Association. "We wanted to exhibit a way to help with and showing that we care about the safety of our community and the whole food supply chain," she said.

Hand sanitizer donations have also been made to medical centers, nursing homes, and farm bureaus across the state.||2
2020-06-12||A campaign for a new Royal Yacht to be commissioned to help Britain secure post-Brexit trade deals has growing support from politicians and captains of industry.

There is, however, one crucial flaw: I hear that it does not have the backing of the Queen.

During a conversation with a close friend who had observed that the idea of a new Britannia was gaining momentum, the Monarch’s response was described as ‘lukewarm’.

I’m told: ‘Her Majesty said the last thing she wanted was for the Royal Family to be seen as “angling” for something that detractors could claim was just another royal bauble. She was effectively saying she did not want the hassle.’

And although Prince Philip had been initially keen on the idea of a ‘floating embassy’, he now holds the view that the subject has just become the ‘inevitable political football’.

Reports last weekend said Philip would welcome a go-ahead for a new Britannia as the ‘ideal present’ for his 100th birthday next year, but a royal source tells me: ‘HRH does not believe the concept of a state yacht is feasible at this time.’

John Major’s Government announced in 1994 that it would be decommissioned. Watching it being taken out of service in 1997 was one of the few times the Queen was seen to shed a tear in public. The yacht is now a tourist attraction, berthed in Leith, Edinburgh.

A new yacht, which would cost at least £100 million, was backed by Boris Johnson when Foreign Secretary. He said it would ‘add greatly to the soft power of this country’.

Car parks tycoon Sir Donald Gosling, who was close to the Queen, had pledged £50 million. But shortly before his death last year he said: ‘It would have to be paid for by industry. It could only be deemed a “Royal Yacht” if it had the support of the Queen and the Navy.’

In the acclaimed recent film version of Little Women, Florence Pugh’s character, Amy March, became the model of refined elegance. But in real life, the actress is fed up with her generation’s poor table manners.

‘I know how to go to a dinner and be my most polite self,’ declares the daughter of Oxford restaurateur Clinton Pugh. [But] ‘when you go for a dinner with strangers and someone is not listening to you whatsoever, and talking at the top of their voice, that really bothers me.’

Dinner-party bores are not the only bugbear for Florence, 24, (left) who’s courting Zach Braff, an American actor 20 years her senior.

‘Also, chewing with your mouth open is not good,’ she says. ‘It’s so easy just to close it.’

Earl Spencer has generously allowed his private chef to use the kitchens at his Northamptonshire stately home, Althorp, to spend the past six weeks preparing more than 11,000 meals for NHS staff.

‘Cooking for the people working day in, day out to fight Covid-19 was an incredible experience,’ says chef Danny Tompkins.

‘It was one of the biggest challenges I’ve ever undertaken, but definitely the most rewarding.’ Lord Spencer, brother of Princess Diana, says it’s ‘the least we could do’.

Of all the hospital exits by Covid survivors, none can have been so dramatic as that of Oscar-winning songwriter Don Black.

He’s revealed that nurses lined up to sing one of his most famous tunes as he was pushed out of Chelsea & Westminster Hospital in a wheelchair.

‘The door opened and about 30 nurses clapped me and sang Born Free,’ the lyricist tells me. ‘It was an incredible goosebump moment I’ll obviously never forget. I wasn’t expecting applause, let alone the song.’

Black, 81, whose classics include the James Bond themes Diamonds Are Forever, fought a ‘touch-and-go’ battle against the disease for nine days.

‘I owe them my life,’ he says of the NHS staff. ‘They took all the terror out of it. A nurse would come and squeeze my hand and say: “You’re doing very well.” When I went to bed, a nurse would stroke my hair and say: “Sweet dreams.”

Chat show host Alan Carr, who is 44 on Monday, is not sure middle age suits him.

‘When you’re not the best-looking person in the world, you hope you’ll age like a fine wine,’ he says.

2020-06-12||(Reuters) - The top U.S. infectious disease official on Friday cautioned that the “blips” of rising coronavirus hospitalizations being reported by some states could get out of control if robust contact tracing regimes are not put in place.

As restrictions on economic activity are lifted, the United States was bound to see increased infections, Anthony Fauci told CNN.

“But when you start seeing more hospitalizations, that’s a sure fire sign that you’re in a situation where you’re going in the wrong direction,” Fauci said.

So far, more than 114,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the United States, according to a Reuters tally. About half a dozen U.S. states are grappling with a rising number of coronavirus patients filling hospital beds.

Texas and North Carolina on Friday reported their highest hospitalization rates since the pandemic began. But officials in both states point out they also have among the lowest rates of deaths from COVID-19.

Fauci underscored that increased hospitalizations was a worrying trend, however, and a sign that “maybe we need to slow down a little” on reopenings.

North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said on Friday that while his state’s rise in hospitalizations and new cases was sobering, moving ahead with more reopenings was not off the table.

Texas has been at the forefront of states’ efforts to reopen their economies and Governor Greg Abbott on Friday said in an interview with KYTX TV it would remain that way “because we have so many hospital beds available to anybody who gets ill.”

“For every person in a hospital bed, there are 10 open, available hospital beds available for them,” Abbott said. “So there’s plenty of hospital capacity to be able to deal with COVID-19.”

He added that there is “no real need to ratchet back the opening of businesses in the state.”

A handful of states and cities have paused or slowed reopenings.

Oregon Governor Kate Brown said she would put county applications to reopen on hold after the state reported a record daily rise in new coronavirus cases on Thursday.

“This is essentially a statewide ‘yellow light,’ it’s time to press pause for one week before any further reopening,” Brown, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Utah’s Republican Governor Gary Herbert on Friday ordered most of the state to halt reopening while it investigated a jump in cases.

“I don’t want to go forward and then take a step backward,” Herbert said of the order that remains in effect until June 26.||1
2020-06-12||The voices are ringing out across the sporting landscape. From Austin to Iowa City, from Clemson to Columbus, the cries for change are pleading to be heard.

College athletes are demanding equality and creating kinetic and dynamic change. In the wake of George Floyd’s homicide by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, the sports world has been indelibly altered in just a few short weeks. And the most promising part is that this feels like the beginning.

Should we start at Clemson? President Jim Clements announced on Friday morning that the board of trustees passed a ruling to rename an honors college and requested a building on campus be renamed because both namesakes had direct links to slavery. This came just days after former Clemson stars Deshaun Watson and DeAndre Hopkins petitioned on social media for changes.

Should we look at Texas? A group of football players and other athletes announced via social media that they want the school to rename buildings on campus and change the school song played at athletic events because of ties to racism.

The Texas athletes also want to add a black athletic history exhibit to the school’s hall of fame. The players threatened to not take part in recruiting visits for incoming players and other alumni events until the changes are made.

“We aim to hold the athletic department and university to a higher standard by not only asking them to keep their promise of condemning racism on our campus, but to go beyond this by taking action to make Texas more comfortable and inclusive for the black athletes and the black community,” said the Texas athletes in a statement.

Should we go to Iowa City? Coach Kirk Ferentz held a news conference with three players on Friday to speak about the “raw” conversations within the program in the wake of a wave of accusations that strength coach Chris Doyle fostered an environment where black players felt degraded. (Doyle is suspended pending an investigation.)

The changes, stands and shifts are happening in myriad ways. The NCAA, an organization that operates glacially, announced that they are “encouraging all member schools” to assist students in registering to vote in the upcoming election and designate Nov. 3 as a day off to accommodate that. (Last year, college basketball held one of its marquee events, the Champions Classic, on Election Day.)

College sports isn’t alone. The changes are rippling through other sports. The Confederate flag has been banned in NASCAR. NBA players are rallying together to make sure they are treated fairly when they are quarantined in the bubble for the conclusion of their season. A coup in the NFL offices led to Michael Thomas, Patrick Mahomes and a slew of other top stars guilting the NFL and commissioner Roger Goodell into saying that Black Lives Matter.

It’d be naïve to celebrate this evolution as a revolution, as there’d been too many decades of systemic racism in our country to get too excited about a few weeks percolating with promising changes. (After all, President Trump is still using Colin Kaepernick’s kneeling to protest police brutality as a cultural prop to rally his base.) But it’d also be naïve to ignore the significance of the baby steps toward change, and root hard for them to become bigger and more pronounced.

This is especially true in the college athletics community as the unpaid stars have found their voice, channeled their power and begun steps to make sure that they’re heard.

“You’re seeing a lot more student-athletes speaking up, and it’s great,” Clements told Yahoo Sports in a phone interview Friday afternoon. “I’m really proud of my guys who are taking a stand and using the platform.”

That includes star quarterback Trevor Lawrence, who has begun forging a compelling identity the past few months. He’s raised thousands for charity in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and spoke vocally and eloquently about racial injustice in the wake of Floyd’s killing.

“I’m siding with my brothers that deal, and continuously deal, with things I will never experience,” Lawrence said on Twitter. “The injustice is clear… and so it the hate. It can no longer be explained away. If you’re still ‘explaining’ it – check your heart and ask why.”

Lawrence has comported himself better than his own head coach, Dabo Swinney, who so far has failed to fully exploit his platform to affect change by talking in circles. Lawrence and three teammates — Mike Jones, Darien Rencher and Cornell Powell — are leading a peaceful protest this weekend designed to bring the community together in the Clemson area.

There have almost been too many important moments to rattle off without this story becoming a list. Athletes with ties to a bevy of schools — Utah, Clemson and Iowa, to name a few — have detailed racial incidents with coaches on social media. Then there was Marvin Wilson, the star Florida State defensive tackle, calling out coach Mike Norvell for airbrushing the truth about reaching out to all his FSU players in the wake of Floyd’s death. There’s former Harvard star Seth Towns, who transferred to Ohio State, speaking out after getting detained at a peaceful protest in Columbus.

“I was standing up for what I believe in,” Towns told Yahoo’s Jeff Eisenberg. “I wasn’t stopping whether I was being detained, arrested or beaten.”

Longtime observers can’t recall a similar moment to what we’re in right now.

“I think this going to change athletics,” former college basketball coach and ESPN analyst Fran Fraschilla said on Friday. “We’re in an amazing period of time. It’s obviously historic.”

Amid the dizzying flood of news on Friday was the reminder from Florida, which signed a name, image and likeness bill into law, that suggests just how different college sports will look in nearly a year.

What started as a flurry of statements from coaches two weeks ago in the wake of Floyd’s death has been followed up by much more significant actions by athletes around college sports. The paradigm shifts are just beginning.

Here’s hoping that we remember this time as the start of something much bigger.

2020-06-14||The Queen and the Coup

 Sunday, Channel 4, 9pm

 This documentary focuses on the events of 1953, when Queen Elizabeth, just a year into her reign, was deployed in a US plot to topple Iran’s democratic leader in favour of an all-powerful shah. Planned by MI6 and carried out by the CIA, it would have a huge impact on relations between Iran and the West, which continue to be problematic. However, as the documentary discovers, even the queen herself didn’t know the truth about her role. Drawing on newly declassified secret documents, this programme reveals what really happened for the first time.

Two years ago, Russian nationals Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were targets of a bizarre assassination attempt, using the highly toxic drug Novichok. When the pair were found unconscious on a park bench in the English town of Salisbury, police were baffled, and this three-part drama re-enacts the series of events as authorities, realising with horror what has happened, move to lock down the town to prevent the deadly toxin infecting more people. Rafe Spall stars as DS Nick Bailey, who becomes ill soon after he visits the Skripals’ home in search of clues. Anne-Marie Duff plsyd Tracy Daszkiewicz, the public health director who must move fast to save the people of Salisbury from becoming infected.

Macbeth: Royal Shakespeare Company

 Sunday, BBC4, 9.30pm

 This 2018 contemporary production of Shakespeare’s darkest psychological thriller, directed by Polly Findlay, marked both Christopher Eccleston’s RSC debut in the title role, and the return of Niamh Cusack to the company as Lady Macbeth. Returning home from battle, the victorious Macbeth meets three witches on the heath. Driven by their disturbing prophecies, the rugged soldier sets out on the path to murder. The supporting cast is on fine form, with three standout performers: Edward Bennett as a moving Macduff, Luke Newberry as Malcolm and, perhaps most impressive of all, Raphael Sowole as a thoughtful Banquo.

Come Dine with Me

 Monday, Channel 4, 5.30pm

 It might not do much for those lockdown diets, but this ever engaging series is always a tasty confection, especially if you fancy a break from the endlessly bleak news. Now the cooking contest is back for a new run, and in Hertfordshire, bargain-seeker Heidi (33) serves up a bold Asian menu. The cost-conscious host cooks a cheap meat alternative for her starter. But will it – and a game that mimics her shopping habits – satisfy her guests? Bon appetit!

Murder in the Car Park

 Monday, Channel 4, 9pm

 In March 1987, the body of private investigator Daniel Morgan was found in the car park of a south London pub with £1,000 in his pocket and an axe buried in his head. More than 30 years on, who killed him remains a mystery. Channel 4 tries to outdo Netflix with this true crime documentary series, which delves into Morgan’s murder. The case has been linked to the News of the World investigative journalism scandal as well as London’s criminal underworld, police corruption and even the British establishment. For the first time, those once suspected of killing Morgan, the investigating officers and his grieving brother tell their side of this disturbing story.

From labyrinthine bazaars to Persepolis – the seat of Persia’s ancient kings – to a temple where a holy fire has burned for 1,000 years, broadcaster and journalist Samira Ahmed goes on a remarkable journey to places rarely seen. The Persians once ruled a vast empire from Egypt to northern India, but their culture was very nearly lost. While the history of their ancient kings was almost forgotten, waves of conquering dynasties brought a new language and a new religion. But despite subjugation, blood and revolution, Persia’s culture flourished. Iranians’ sense of identity helped them weather the storms of conquest, and their art and language became weapons of resistance and defiance.

Making a Museum: The Story of MoLI

 Tuesday, RTÉ One, 7pm

Holy MoLI! Can it be a year since the Museum of Literature Ireland opened its doors on Dublin’s Stephen’s Green, providing a splendid Georgian space where people could celebrate Ireland’s great writers? MoLI houses hundreds of years of great Irish literature, including the first-ever copy of Ulysses. To celebrate Bloomsday (for it is today), RTÉ is screening this half-hour documentary by Luke McManus, who followed the MoLI from the beginning, rolling the cameras while this unique project was being rolled out. McManus has worked the camera for Dermot Bannon’s Room to Improve, and it soon becomes apparent that this is one renovation job for the books.

Tutankhamun in Colour

 Tuesday, BBC 4, 9pm

 Oxford University Egyptologist Elizabeth Frood is our guide to the discovery of the tomb in 1922 by Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon. It provided much-needed good news, following the Great War and the Spanish flu pandemic of 1919 and we’ve been transfixed ever since. From bringing to life the young Carter from an old family photo, documenting Egypt’s transformation during the Great War, to the great operation excavating the tomb and the grand revealing of Tutankhamun itself – colourisation brings a new element of realism to this great moment in history.

24 Hours in A&E

 Tuesday, Channel 4, 9pm

 The hospital documentary returns, focusing on the stories of two motorcyclists, which reveal how the bonds between loved ones can be strengthened through adversity. Prezmek may have life-changing spinal injuries following a high-speed motorcycle crash on the M4, forcing his wife Tatia to reflect on how their plans for the future may have to change. Teenager Leon undergoes a CT scan after crashing. While waiting for the results, his mother Janey thinks back to his school days.

There’s a new party drug in town. It’s called Blis, and all the cool kids in Berlin are getting off on it. The drug is sweeping the German capital’s club scene, but there’s a nasty side-effect: anyone who ingests it has their body taken over by aliens from outer space. Bummer. The adventure begins when Berlin woman Nora isn’t feeling quite herself after a wild night out. Meanwhile, investigators Nique Navar and David Leonhart are investigating why teenagers are suddenly vanishing – is this another side-effect of Blis? Sounds like good, clean bodysnatching fun.

Hawks & Doves: The Crown and Ireland’s War of Independence

 Wednesday, RTÉ One, 9.35pm

You may be surprised that Diarmaid Ferriter is not presenting this new two-part documentary on a seminal event in Irish history. You may be even more surprised that the presenter is none other than former Tory MP and British defence secretary Michael Portillo. But Portillo brings a unique insight into this time of turmoil, exploring how his predecessors at Westminster reacted to seismic events across the Irish Sea. Turns out that many English politicians at the time were less concerned with the Irish question and more interested in furthering their own political careers. Portillo gets into the mindset of Britain’s parliament of the day, and how the Conservatives used the War of Independence as a weapon to empower their own party. Unsurprisingly, it doesn’t seem a million miles away from all the intrique and chicanery that went on in the House of Commons during Brexit.

If you thought Earth needed millions of years to change, it’s time to think again: this film uses the latest science to reveal how much our planet can change in just one single day. Fact: Earth makes a mountain of new rock every hour and is not only constantly changing shape but is also losing weight. In fact, every day you wake up on a completely different planet.The documentary starts on the island of Stromboli, where geologist Chris Jackson climbs a volcano to see how much lava a single volcano can produce on a daily basis and how it builds new land. In Iceland we find out how the entire country is growing as the inner Earth forces the continents apart and creates new land in between. (The moving of continents causes around 300,000 earthquakes each day.)

Keeping Britain Fed

 Wednesday, BBC2, 8pm

 Cast your mind back to February and March. People were going about their daily lives, and perhaps stopping off at the corner shop or supermarket to pick up our groceries on their way home. Suddenly that all changed, and during the lockdown, our perception of those who keep us fed shifted dramatically. For this one-off documentary, Sara Cox and Ade Adepitan are given access to some of Britain’s biggest food retailers and their suppliers to see how their systems stood up to the most testing time in their history. Cox finds out what goes on in one supermarket, while Adepitan witnesses how the UK’s farms, factories and depots rose to the challenge of producing and suppling food in the exceptional circumstances.

Architect George Clarke delves into the world of small builds, meeting people taking tiny, unpromising spaces and creating places to live, work and play. In the first episode, Clarke talkes to a couple who are creating a disappearing bathroom and a man squeezing a camper into a Reliant Robin. He also discovers Chile’s stunning architecture, and plans his hardest-ever build: an observatory. The full series will be available on All4 after this episode is broadcast.

O’Casey in the Estate

 Thursday, RTÉ One, 10.15pm

 Theatre has a grand tradition of posh people pretending to be ordinary folk – they win Tony awards for it. But imagine if the plain people of Ireland got to be in the plays of O’Casey while the luvvies had to wait in the wings. In this two-part documentary, the people of Dublin’s East Wall prepare to stage a production of The Plough and the Stars, which depicted life that area 100 years ago. What’s changed in the community in the past century? Well, they may no longer be living in tenements, but the people of East Wall still feel they don’t have a voice in modern Ireland. So what better platform than the Abbey stage? Director Caitriona ||2

2020-06-14||IT WAS BY digital video shared in May that global attention first turned to the killing of George Floyd. In a striking parallel, it was again by video that Derek Chauvin, the white police officer filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, made his first appearance in court as a murder suspect. Handcuffed and in an orange jumpsuit, with a protective mask over his mouth, the 44-year-old cop was beamed into Hennepin County court in Minneapolis on June 8th for around 15 minutes from a maximum-security prison. From there, through the lens of a digital video camera, Mr Chauvin looked on as a judge told him his bail would be set for at least $1m.

The coronavirus pandemic has forced courts around the globe to modernise with unprecedented haste. America’s covid-19 stimulus package includes a provision for federal judges to use teleconferencing. Its Supreme Court conducted hearings by telephone for the first time. India’s Supreme Court began hearing all cases on an app called Vidyo on March 23rd. Spain held its first internet trial in May. Britain’s Supreme Court changed its rules to require all evidence to be submitted digitally. A branch of government built on precedent is now procedurally breaking it. The speed with which it is doing so means the effects are hard to predict but certain to reshape the judicial system, even after covid-19 has subsided.

Legal reformers have long advocated digitisation. Technology can make justice cheaper and more accessible, streamlining systems already stretched to their limits. Hearings in digital conference rooms can be easier to attend than physical ones for reporters covering the courts. Remote proceedings also prevent the spread of disease. The best way to get people into otherwise packed courtrooms without the risk of contagion is by video link. Although speaking on services such as Zoom feels awkward, some research has shown that digital platforms have little effect on verdicts. Defendants in a simulated criminal trial who testified on camera in a recent Australian study were no more likely to be found guilty than those who appeared beside their lawyers in court.

But such technology is untested at scale. Research so far on its impact has been inconclusive. Slow internet speeds, bad hardware and confusing software can negate the time and expense supposedly saved. Human-rights advocates argue that delivering harsh sentences remotely is “inhumane”—if society is going to condemn someone to death, it should have the courage to do it face to face. Indeed, in May a man in Singapore received his death sentence (for drug smuggling) by Zoom.

Further, digital justice threatens to upend the ancient understanding that courts should be open to the public. Spectators remind courts that their decisions have bearing on society. Video access could make courtrooms more accessible by extending the number of people who might attend from a few dozen to thousands or more. But as internet users have discovered over the past decade, the web is easy to wall off. Courts could block access with passwords and private Zoom sessions, or leave proceedings open but difficult to join, on hard-to-find web pages. So video justice needs rules ensuring some public scrutiny.

For legal systems, the pandemic has amounted to an unexpected, months-long experiment into digital procedure. Richard Susskind, author of “Online Courts and the Future of Justice", said at a recent British parliamentary committee meeting that the adoption of remote hearings around the world has for the first time produced a significant amount of data for researchers. Both civil-law and common-law countries appear to be adopting remote courts at similar rates, he says. Countries with a greater openness to alternative dispute-resolution processes, such as mediation or conciliation, may be more open to new technologies.

Initial findings suggest a divergence between the branches of the justice system. Civil cases—those without juries—appear to transfer easily to cyberspace. On June 5th Britain’s Civil Justice Council published a report that surveyed more than 1,000 lawyers, journalists and members of the public who had taken part in remote civil cases since mid-March. Some 71.5% of respondents said they had had a positive or very positive experience with remote hearings.

Yet anecdotal evidence suggests that participants in family courts have been less positive. In Britain judges have spoken out about the difficulty of handling delicate matters such as child custody remotely. Family-court justices often speak directly with lay participants at the end of trials to explain their decisions. The internet curtails opportunities to offer empathy outside a hearing’s regular formalities. In criminal courts, meanwhile, the need for juries has posed big challenges. It would be difficult to ensure the impartiality of jurors logging in from their kitchen tables, where they could be influenced by outsiders.

As countries relax social-distancing restrictions, courts may face new and potentially even more difficult questions. Young demonstrators newly alive to the inequities of the justice system—its great costs, its slowness, its procedural complexities and robed formalities often alien to those of humbler backgrounds—may bring greater scrutiny to courts. Many have amassed backlogs of cases put on pause during the pandemic. To cope, authorities may have to keep more of the emergency digital measures than they might have imagined.

2020-06-14||What will be the political legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic? This column uses data from the 2006-2018 Gallup World Polls to show that epidemic exposure during an individual’s ‘impressionable years’ of 18 to 25 has a persistent negative effect on trust in political institutions and leaders, especially in democracies. Combined with other evidence that trust is important for limiting the spread of infection, this raises the spectre of a circular, self-reinforcing spiral in which poor public health policy leads to deeper distrust, further undermining the effectiveness of public health policy.

It is widely argued (e.g. Fukyuama 2020) that the keys to success in dealing with COVID-19 are “whether citizens trust their leaders, and whether those leaders preside over a competent and effective state.” By way of example, Rothstein (2020) ascribes the greater success at containing the COVID-19 in the Nordic countries than in Italy in part to greater trust in government.

Trust in government is not a given, however (Dustmann et al. 2017, Grosjean 2019). Specifically, there is reason to ask whether COVID-19 itself will affect trust in political institutions and leaders.

In a new paper, we provide the first evidence on the effects of epidemics on political trust (Aksoy et al. 2020). We use individual-level data on confidence in political institutions and leaders from the 2006-2018 Gallup World Polls (GWP), fielded in nearly 140 countries annually. Our data cover some 750,000 respondents from 142 countries. We analyse responses to questions about confidence in the government, confidence in elections, and approval of national leaders. We link these individual responses to the incidence of epidemics since 1970 as tabulated in the EM-DAT International Disasters Database (see Figure 1). By incorporating a wide range of fixed effects, controlling various observable characteristics as well as past exposure to other economic and political shocks, we can address potential concerns with omitted variables.

Figure 1 Average number of people (per million) affected by epidemics, 1970-2017

Notes: This figure shows the number of people affected by epidemics (per million), averaged across all available years. 

Source: EM-DAT International Disaster Database, 1970-2017, UN Population Database, 1970-2017, and authors’ calculations.

Building on previous work suggesting that attitudes and behaviour are durably moulded in what psychologists and sociologists refer to as the ‘impressionable’ late-adolescent and early-adult years, we show that exposure to epidemics at this stage in the life course durably shapes confidence in political institutions and attitudes toward political leaders. (On the ‘impressionable years’, hypothesis, see Dawson and Prewitt 1969 and Krosnick and Alwin 1989; for an economic application, see Guiliano and Spilimbergo 2014.)

Specifically, we find that individuals who experience epidemics in their impressionable years (specifically, ages 18 to 25) display less confidence in political leaders, governments, and elections. The effects are substantial: an individual with the highest exposure to an epidemic (relative to zero exposure) is 7.2 percentage points less likely to have confidence in the honesty of elections; 5.1 percentage points less likely to have confidence in the national government; and 6.2 percentage points less likely to approve the performance of the political leader. (The respective averages of these three variables in our sample are 51%, 50%, and 50%.) These effects represent the average treatment values for the remainder of life. They decay only gradually and persist for two decades: the difference between the median age during impressionable years (21.5) and the median age in the last subsample (40.5) corresponds to 19 years (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Effects of epidemics in impressionable years over subsamples with rolling age-windows

Note: This figure shows the persistence of the effects on three main outcome variables by restricting the observations to the respondents who are in the 26-35 age range at the time of the survey (Base sample) and then repeatedly rolling this age window forward by one year for each separate estimation. The plotted coefficient is Exposure to epidemic (18-25) in Equation (1) in Aksoy et al. (2000). Confidence intervals are at 95% significance level. 

Source: Gallup World Polls, 2006-2018 and EM-DAT International Disaster Database, 1970-2017.

There is significant heterogeneity in these effects. Less-educated individuals respond more strongly, adopting even more negative attitudes towards political institutions and leaders. Residents of urban areas respond more negatively than those residing in rural areas. Women display larger drops in confidence. The negative impact of epidemic exposure is larger in middle- and high-income countries.

We then explore amplification and transmission mechanisms. We show that the effects we identify are specific to communicable diseases, such as viruses, which can spread contagiously and where a timely and effective public policy response is critical for containment. For non-communicable diseases, in contrast, we do not see the same impact of past impressionable-year outbreaks on subsequent views of the trustworthiness of governments and leaders.

In addition, individuals exposed to epidemics in their impressionable years are less likely to have confidence in the public health system and the safety and efficacy of vaccination. The former is indicative of trust in the overall health policies of the government, while the latter can be taken as reflecting attitudes specifically toward pharmaceutical interventions. These findings suggest that the perceived (in)adequacy of health-related government interventions during epidemics, both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical, are important for trust in government more generally.

In addition, the magnitude of the effect we identify depends on the strength of the government at the time of the epidemic. When individuals experience epidemics under weak governments, the negative impact on trust is larger and more persistent. This is consistent with the idea that such governments are less capable of effectively responding to epidemics, hence leading to a long-term fall in political trust.

We substantiate this conjecture by considering this same conditioning factor, government strength, in the context of COVID-19. We show that government strength is associated with statistically significant improvements in policy response time (the number of days between the date of first confirmed case and the date of the first non-pharmaceutical intervention). This supports the notion that government strength at the time of the epidemic is a predictor of effective policy responses and that its absence amplifies the negative revision of political trust in response to epidemics.

Finally, we show that our results are driven by the reaction to epidemic exposure in democracies. In democracies, residents sharply and persistently revise (downward) their political trust in the event of impressionable-year epidemic exposure. The same is not true in autocracies. Evidently, citizens expect democratic governments to be responsive to their health concerns, and where the public-sector response is not sufficient to head off the epidemic, they revise their views in unfavourable ways. In autocracies, in contrast, there may not exist a comparable expectation of responsiveness and hence no impact on political trust. In addition, democratic regimes may find consistent messaging more difficult. Because such regimes are open, they may allow for a cacophony of conflicting official views, resulting in a larger impact on trust when things go wrong.

Trust and confidence in government are important for the capacity of a society to organise an effective collective response to an epidemic. Yet there is also the possibility that experiencing an epidemic can negatively affect an individual’s confidence in political institutions and trust in political leaders, with negative implications for this collective capacity. We have shown that this negative effect is large and persistent. Its largest and most enduring impact is on the attitudes of individuals who are in their impressionable late-adolescent and early-adult years when an epidemic breaks out.

In addition, epidemic exposure in one’s impressionable years matters mainly for residents of democratic countries. Residents in democracies sharply revise downward their confidence and trust in political institutions and leaders following significant exposure, whereas the same is not true in autocracies. It may be that citizens expect democratic governments to be responsive to their concerns and that where the public-sector response is not adequate, they revise their attitudes unfavourably. In autocracies, there may not exist a comparable expectation of responsiveness. In addition, democratic regimes may find consistent messaging more difficult. Because such regimes are open, they may allow for a cacophony of conflicting official views, resulting in a larger impact on confidence and trust.

The implications are disturbing. Imagine that more trust in government is important for effective containment, but that failure of containment harms trust in government.1 One can envisage a scenario where low levels of trust allow an epidemic to spread, and where the spread of the epidemic reduces trust in government still further, hindering the ability of the authorities to contain future epidemics and address other social problems. As Schmitt (2020) puts it, “lack of trust in government can be a circular, self-reinforcing phenomenon: Poor performance leads to deeper distrust, in turn leaving government in the hands of those with the least respect for it.”

2020-06-14||Those common, vibrating “thwip” helicopter sounds arrived well before they showed up, as 413th Flight Test Squadron personnel turned to look to the north at Eglin Air Force Base, May 19.

Seconds later, two helicopters appeared and the sounds and vibrations intensified. The Air Force’s newest combat search and rescue helicopter, the HH-60W Jolly Green II, led the way down the Duke Field runway. It was followed by the Army’s multi-role combat helicopter, the AH-64 Apache.

The two aircraft landed at Eglin AFB completing their first flight and combined test mission together.

The Apache, from Redstone Army Test Center, Alabama, flew in for system testing with the HH-60W.

“The unique configuration of the AH-64 Apache gave our team the opportunity to test capabilities of the HH-60W in ways normally not possible here,” said Christopher Martin, 413th FLTS HH-60W lead test engineer “Tests like these will ensure the Jolly Green II will be able to perform its critical combat search and rescue mission when fielded in the joint warfighting environment.”

The joint service test-effort marks another milestone in Jolly Green II’s development. This year, the new helicopter has completed extreme environment, communications and defense system testing just to name a few.

The 413th FLTS leads the HH-60W integrated test team along with members of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, 88th Test and Evaluation Squadron, Detachment 2, and Air Force Operational Test Center.

“We are very proud of the work our integrated test team accomplished in 2020 despite a myriad of operational restrictions due to COVID-19,” said Shawn Hammond, HH-60W test program manager. “The team’s success is due to a mission-focused mindset to ensure the crews flying the Jolly Green II into combat have the most reliable and capable helicopter for the job.”

2020-06-14||The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns about the future of work. The pandemic may become recurrent and necessitate repeated adoptions of social distancing measures, creating substantial uncertainty about worker productivity. This column presents a theoretical framework suggesting that such job uncertainty reduces aggregate demand, and dampens business investment in general. However, automation may provide one way for businesses to cope with the uncertainty about worker productivity. It appears that pandemic-induced job uncertainty could stimulate automation investment, despite declines in aggregate demand.

The Covid-19 outbreak is leading to a steep decline in global economic activity as countries around the world use social distancing measures to avoid exposure to the coronavirus or to limit its spread. The pandemic has also led to a surge in uncertainty. The ‘VIX’ – a frequently used measure of uncertainty – spiked to levels surpassing even those experienced during the 2007-2008 global crisis (see Figure 1). While the VIX has declined since its March peak, its level remains elevated by historical standards, suggesting that households and businesses are still facing a highly uncertain environment.

An important source of this uncertainty stems from the unknown evolution of the virus and the effectiveness of social distancing measures. Absent the discovery of an effective vaccine with widespread availability, additional waves of infections remain a possibility. Thus, social distancing measures and lockdowns may need to be periodically reintroduced to deal with future infection flare-ups, which may portend a ‘new normal’ in which viral infections become more pervasive and forceful. Such an uncertain environment is highly challenging for businesses that need employees to be on site, since workers may be exposed to potential health risks or have to stay home due to lockdowns. Thus, businesses may need to consider alternative strategies to minimise the impact of future production disruptions.

For some businesses, automation may be an attractive option (e.g. Kilic and Marin 2020). By reducing the need for on-site human interactions, investing in robots, for instance, could help address concerns about future viral outbreaks (and the associated production disruptions). On the other hand, businesses typically refrain from investing in the face of heightened uncertainty, preferring to wait for more clarity (e.g. Bloom 2009, Leduc and Liu 2016). As a result, while automation may provide one way to cope with the production uncertainty induced by the pandemic, it also necessitates investment spending that firms may be reluctant to actually make. Given the rarity of serious viral outbreaks in much of the world in recent decades, empirical results describing how firms adapt to such situations are limited. Ma et al. (2020) provide evidence for the impact of epidemics in Asia over the past 20 years, but their analysis does not apply to the rest of the world. In this context, estimated theoretical models can provide a useful alternative, complementing some of the emerging work on uncertainty and the pandemic. For some recent empirical studies on pandemic-induced uncertainty, see Baker et al. (2020), Leduc and Liu (2020a) and Dietrich et al. (2020). Further, the new eBook by Baldwin and di Mauro (2020) contains additional essays on a wide range of topics related to COVID-19 economics.

In a recent paper (Leduc and Liu 2020b), we develop a quantitative New Keynesian model of the labour market. In this model, firms face uncertainty about future labour productivity and have the ability to automate jobs. We focus on one channel of pandemic-induced uncertainty that we label job uncertainty, emphasising the impact that future outbreaks may have on worker productivity. For simplicity, we assume that productivity is impacted by labour-specific productivity shocks that are subject to ‘second-moment’ disturbances, capturing variations in uncertainty.

We build on our earlier work (Leduc and Liu 2019) and study the role of automation in an economy with ‘search and matching frictions’ in the labour market. Firms create, and post, job vacancies to hire workers and produce goods. Firms that are unsuccessful in finding a worker can decide to automate the job with a robot. Robots can perfectly substitute for workers, therefore differing from physical capital in standard macro models. In this sense, automation is a form of labour-saving technology.

Adopting a robot entails a fixed cost, and using a robot also incurs an operating cost. A firm’s decision to adopt a robot depends on the relative benefit of automating versus keeping a vacancy open. If a firm decides to keep a vacancy open, it can decide to fill it with a worker or a robot in the future. Importantly, in contrast to workers, robots and their productivity would not be susceptible to epidemics, since viruses do not impede their ability to produce. Hence, whether to automate or not will partly depend on current, and expected, future worker productivity, and pandemic-induced job uncertainty would be an important factor underlying automation decisions.

To assess the quantitative effects of job uncertainty, we first estimate our model to fit quarterly US time series data from 1985:Q1 to 2018:Q4. In addition to the unemployment and vacancy rates, we fit the model to the time series of real wages, labour productivity, inflation, and nominal interest rates. Since the rate of automation has important implications for productivity and wage growth, including these variables helps discipline the importance of automation. In our estimation, we do not consider pandemic-induced uncertainty, since pandemics are not observed in our sample. After we estimate the model, we introduce uncertainty shocks to worker productivity to examine its macroeconomic effects.

We show that an increase in pandemic-induced job uncertainty operates through two channels: a demand-reducing channel and a technology-switching channel. First, the job uncertainty raises precautionary saving and reduces household consumption. Since prices are sticky, firms cut production to meet the reduced demand for their products. All else being equal, the decline in economic activity reduces a firm’s incentive to invest in automation. However, through the technology-switching channel, the job uncertainty would incentivise a firm to automate, since robots are not susceptible to viruses and can continue to operate during epidemics.

Figure 2 shows that a pandemic-induced uncertainty shock raises the unemployment rate whilst also boosts automation in the benchmark model (the blue solid lines). These impulse responses reflect that the technology-switching channel dominates the demand-reducing channel under our estimation.

In general, increased automation can have ambiguous impacts on employment. Since robots substitute for workers, increased automation tends to reduce employment. However, given the option of automation, a firm would have a stronger incentive to create new job vacancies because of the reduced risks associated with hiring workers. Under our estimated parameters, this latter channel boosts employment and outweighs the labour-substituting effects of automation.

To illustrate the interactions between automation and unemployment in our model, we consider a counterfactual model in which automation is kept constant at its steady-state value. Figure 2 shows that, with no fluctuations in automation, a pandemic-induced job uncertainty shock would have led to a deeper recession with a sharper increase in unemployment (the red dashed line). Therefore, endogenous automation decisions help alleviate the recessionary impact of the job uncertainty shock. An alternative way to interpret our results is that automation reduces some tasks done by workers, whereas it facilitates other tasks, which boosts overall employment (e.g. Acemoglu and Restrepo 2019).

Figure 2 Impulse responses to job uncertainty shock in the estimated model

In our model, the effects of an increase in job uncertainty differ markedly from a realised decline in labour productivity such as that occurring in the current pandemic. Since social distancing measures and health concerns during a pandemic can hinder a worker’s ability to work, the fall in labour productivity primarily acts as a negative supply shock that reduces potential output and increases inflation. As a result, firms automate less. In contrast, pandemic-induced job uncertainty leads to a recession by reducing aggregate demand, such that both output and inflation decline. Despite the decline in demand, firms still increase automation investment because of the positive technology-switching channel.

Overall, our finding suggests that pandemic-induced job uncertainty shocks can have a positive net effect on automation investment, despite its negative effects on aggregate demand. Although robots can substitute for workers, the increased automation (stemming from the technology-switching channel) can still mitigate job losses. The option of automating reduces the risk of hiring workers and thus boosts a firm’s incentive for creating new positions.

2020-06-14||Eight hundred and ten students graduated from the Oregon Institute of Technology on Saturday through a virtual ceremony with pre-recorded messages from university President Dr. Nagi Naganathan, U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley, Oregon Health and Sciences University President Dr. Danny Jacobs and other student and university leaders.

“Graduates, as the class of 2020, an imperative has fallen on you that you did not ask for and did not expect. Our world changed so dramatically and so quickly, almost overnight, in ways that have affected just about everyone, not just in our neighborhoods or our states or even our country, but globally,” said Naganathan in his virtual address to students. “While you likely have some strong feelings about having to miss the important rite of passage of an in-person commencement ceremony as we do, I must tell you something very important and very real: This is your time.”

After several speakers, faculty read the names of graduates while their names appeared on screen on an image of an Oregon Tech diploma. Faculty for the various departments students received degrees in appeared on screen after all of the gradates for that department, where the instructors sent well wishes and congratulations to the students they worked with throughout the years.

While Naganathan acknowledged the change of course for spring term due to COVID-19, which was held remotely through online classes, he told the H&N that he felt both faculty and students met the challenge well.

Merkley, in his virtual address, highlighted some of the achievements of graduates, along with some noteworthy alumni activities.

“When the world says ‘how?’ those who specialize in technology say ‘here’s how,’” he said. “That’s where you, the Oregon Tech class of 2020 come in. Each of you has the instincts and the training to take on the challenges of this moment and the years to come.”

“You are in a unique position to use what you’ve learned and the knowledge that you can overcome any obstacle in your way, including a global pandemic, to create those ideas that will change the world.”

Jacobs encouraged graduates to remain resilient as they being their careers.

“I feel hopeful and inspired that you will play a significant role in shaping the bright future that is sure to come, and you should take great pride in what will be an extraordinary place in history as you work together to rebuild an even stronger, more prosperous, equitable and community-minded nation,” Jacobs said.

Student speaker Clark Anderson encouraged his fellow gradates to be more than just acceptable as they enter their careers.

“However, I want to encourage you to be more. More than just productive, more than just another cog in the machine, more than just another average employee. Be bold. Be brave. Be confident. Speak up. Stand out. Ask questions. Make yourself indispensable,” he said. “In short, leave every place you go better than when you found it. Make an impact. Leave a legacy that will make you proud of yourself, everyone around you proud to have known you and Oregon Tech proud to have been part of your story.”

Although Naganathan acknowledged that it was disappointing that they couldn’t have their traditional in-person ceremony, he still feels Oregon Tech’s virtual ceremony was memorable for the graduates.

“We have done our best, we are not sparing any effort, as a matter of fact, as a matter of symbolism, the provost, the dean and myself are going to be on campus, celebrating our students. We have taken care of as many details as possible so that this is a great celebration for our students,” he said. “While there are disappointments for that not being traditional, in some ways we are also making it special in our own way. I think people will remember this commencement in a unique way.”

Graduates could also come by the Klamath Falls campus to get pictures with Nagathan and other university leadership on Saturday. According to Oregon Tech, more than 1,300 people viewed the virtual ceremony in the first four hours on Saturday.

While COVID-19 made it more challenging for Oregon Tech students to finish their degrees, Naganathan said that it also created more opportunities for students to be involved in how their field changes through this pandemic, particularly health care fields.

“Instead of looking at it as only a challenge, I keep asking myself and asking my colleagues, so where are the opportunities?” he said. “Remote care may take a different level of achievement and this changes how we get cared for, and there lies the opportunities in innovating new programs and new opportunities for our students and our society.”

“I do not look at all of this as only a challenge. I think there are great opportunities to redefine education for the next fifty years by doing the right things right now.”

While whether or not students will be able to return to campus come fall term remains uncertain, Naganathan said they are planning for an in-person year in case it is possible.

Oregon Tech already had quite the catalog of online classes, so Naganathan said he felt they were more prepared than others for the required move to distance learning for spring term. Still, he said the university is known for its lab classes, and not being able to have those classes was tough.

“Considering all the challenges, I feel it was an amazing year in a sense of accomplishment, having overcome the challenges.”

Although the second part of the year took a challenging turn, Naganathan said that other achievements like the largest freshman class in the university’s history, new degree programs and new construction projects on campus helped make this year a success.

Naganathan described this graduating class as one that will utilize the adversity they faced this year to change the future.

“I know you are prepared to go out and transform the world, and so do all of your professors and staff who have supported you, as well as your families and friends,” Naganathan said in his commencement speech. “And when you help the world overcome this tremendous time of challenge and struggle, you will know that you have been part of bringing us back. And that, class of 2020, is your legacy. That is your 20/20 vision.”||2
2020-06-14||Hi folks, if you remember, recently I published a website for COVID 19 Tracker with React . How about we explore our strengths in WPF.

Almost everything is different in these 2 projects. They follow different implementation techniques with respect to their technologies.

Let's create a WPF application with an attractive UI. This project is for education purposes only.

I can't attach source code here due to the maximum size limit, but you can directly download it from Github.

Find the following Github repositories for both, and feel free to tag along on Github, leave a star if you like.

Things you will learn in this project:
• Using a material design with WPF to enhance the user experience
• Calling Web-API in any C# backed project with a HttpClient

We will learn each of these steps one by one.

Open Visual Studio & create a new WPF app, Name it as you wish.

First, we are going to add some basic panels.

Now, we need the beauty for our project. Let's add Material.Design.

Go to NuGet Package Manager & do the necessary requirements.

Now that we have added Material design in your project, we still need to import some of the styles. We can directly add them to App.xaml so that they will be available across the application.

Now let us begin with looks.

This is the code behind the add ButtonExit_Click method to add following code:

Now let's add ResourceDictionary in our project, Simply right-click on project & select ResouceDictionary. Name as a Styles.xaml

This is where we are going to keep all styles.

Add this entry in App.xaml as well.

We have divided our page into 3 sections, header which we already added, now we need...

The left panel is kind of navigation control across your entire application.

The right panel is where all 3 cards for confirmed, recovered & deaths count will be displayed, Plus the data of the last updated date & our attractive doughnut charts specifying recovery & fatality rate.

Here is the complete screen,

Now that we are done with designing a UI, Let's move further ahead and add that API class in your project:

We are going to use WebAPI class to make a call to API, For now, we are only using the get method.

This class is responsible for getting our data.

Of course, we are going to follow MVVM architecture. Let's add DataContext for our MainWindow.xaml.

StatusDetails is responsible for storing our API's response. We need to have the same property name as the JSON response that we get from our API.

For now, we are concerned about 4 specific properties:

This class acts as a controller. This is where your UI gets its data & functionalities.

Well, that's just beautiful. Hold on though, we are still missing something.

We forgot to add Itemsource for our Doughnut charts!

The doughnut is partitioned based on numbers and every number has its description associated with it, We need to have a class who can fulfill these needs.

We are going bind 2 properties of this class:

We are sending numbers that we received from API to doughnut chart to calculate the recovery & fatality rate:

Very well done, guys!

So far so good. Now just hit that Start button & embrace the happiness of successfully implementing Covid-19 tracker with WPF & Material design.

Here is the final outcome of your hard work:

We are not done yet, in the future, we will update our left panel and add more screens on the right panel.

This is going to be a good project if you desire to learn WPF.

In this article, we learned how to develop a WPF application with Material design and how to use WebAPI & How to bind properties to UI.

I really hope you have come away from this with a real grasp on how to develop a WPF application.

Thank you all, and I wish you the very best. Keep Learning & Keep Coding!

2020-06-14||The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a massive increase in the demand for essential medical equipment. This column discusses recent findings on the role of international trade of essential medical goods in exacerbating or mitigating the impact of a pandemic. The effects depend crucially on the countries’ trade imbalances in essential medical goods. Net importers of these goods are relatively worse off during a pandemic than net exporters. Although the welfare losses of net importers are lower in a world with high trade barriers, they benefit from reducing barriers once the pandemic arrives.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a massive increase in the demand for essential medical equipment to combat the spread of the disease. For instance, goods such as masks, gloves, respirators, and COVID-19 tests are playing a key role in allowing healthcare workers to respond to the ongoing pandemic. While supply has been gradually increasing to try to satisfy the high demand for these goods, countries continue to face supply shortages and are increasingly forced to ration these goods.

Amidst the growing fear of these supply shortages, countries have been resorting to trade policy to meet domestic demand. According to Evenett (2020), “a growing number of governments have been sickening their trading partners by banning or limiting the export of medical supplies.”

In our recent paper (Leibovici and Santacreu 2020), we document that the heterogeneous response of trade policy across countries is systematically related to the extent to which countries are net importers or net exporters of essential medical goods. We then develop a general equilibrium model of international trade to study the role of trade of essential goods in mitigating or exacerbating the effect of a pandemic like COVID-19.

We combine data on import liberalisations and export restrictions from Global Trade Alert with international trade flow data on essential medical products to fight COVID-19 from UN COMTRADE. We find that, of 109 countries studied, 29 countries have implemented some type of liberalisation on essential medical products since April 2020, whereas 59 countries have imposed restrictions. Moreover, recent changes to trade policy for essential medical goods appear to be systematically related to countries’ positions as net suppliers or net importers of these goods. As of 24 April, 86% of the countries with a trade surplus in these goods have recently imposed restrictive export policies, while this has been the case for only 46% of the countries with a trade deficit.

These findings suggest that international trade plays a fundamental role on the cross-country impact of a pandemic. In Leibovici and Santacreu (2020), we investigate the role of international trade of essential goods in mitigating or exacerbating this impact.

We ask two questions:

1. To what extent does the impact of a pandemic depend on whether countries are net exporters or net importers of essential goods?

2. What is the role of international trade in mitigating or exacerbating the impact of the pandemic?

We address these questions using a dynamic quantitative general equilibrium model with two countries and two sectors: one sector producing essential goods (i.e. medical equipment) and the other sector producing non-essential goods. There are adjustment costs to capital and labour in each sector.

We assume that both countries are symmetric throughout except that one country is relatively more productive in essential goods while the other is relatively more productive in non-essential goods, leading the former to be a net exporter of essential goods and the latter to be a net importer of essential goods.

To what extent does the impact of a pandemic depend on whether countries are net exporters or net importers of essential goods?

We find that, in our model, a global pandemic has significant heterogeneous effects across countries: net importers of essential goods are relatively worse off during a pandemic than net exporters. There are two main forces at play. First, given that it is costly to reallocate production inputs across sectors, producers of essential goods cannot sufficiently boost production, leading to a substantial increase in their relative price. Then, while the price of essential goods increases similarly in both economies, the effect on welfare depends on the countries' sectoral trade imbalances. Both countries earn relatively more for their sales of essential goods, and both countries have to spend relatively more for their purchases of these goods. However, given that the net importer is less productive in essential goods, this country sells less than it purchases, while the reverse is the case for net exporters. As a result, net importers of these goods are relatively worse off.

In Leibovici et al. (2020) we document that the US relies heavily on imports of essential medical goods. Thus, according to the model, the US is likely to be relatively worse off from the supply shortages of medical products amid the COVID-19 pandemic than if it were to be a net exporter of these goods.

What is the role of international trade in mitigating or exacerbating the impact of the pandemic?

We find that the level of international trade barriers at the onset of a pandemic can significantly alter its economic implications. In our model, higher initial trade costs imply that the net importer runs a smaller trade deficit of essential goods than in a world with lower trade costs, while the net exporter runs a smaller trade surplus in these goods. Therefore, while a pandemic continues to lead to a substantial increase in the relative price of essential goods, the relative impact on the home and foreign countries is mitigated. We thus conclude that while higher trade barriers on essential goods may reduce the amount consumed of these goods, they mitigate the potential vulnerability of net importers of these goods when a global pandemic hits.

These findings have important implications for the design of international trade policy. Even if countries may benefit on average from having cheaper access to goods, the reliance on international trade might put these countries in a vulnerable position if these goods are essential and either the supply or demand of these goods is subject to global shocks.

While these findings are informative about the ex-ante design of international trade policy, they are silent about the impact of trade policy changes implemented once a pandemic hits. We thus conclude our analysis by asking: What is the impact of raising trade barriers in response to a pandemic?

In contrast to the previous findings, we now find that raising trade barriers when the pandemic hits can significantly exacerbate the welfare cost faced by net importers of essential goods. As a net importer, the home country's production structure is such that it relies considerably on the foreign country for its consumption of essential goods. Thus, an increase in trade barriers on these goods exacerbates the already painful situation faced by the net importer, making the relative price of essential goods even higher.

These results suggest that the design of international trade policy for essential goods may suffer from a time-inconsistency problem. Net exporters of essential goods may ex-ante prefer to live in a world with low trade costs, but when a global pandemic hits they might be tempted to renege on their previous commitments and increase trade barriers. The reverse is the case for net importers of essential goods, as they ex-ante prefer to live in a world with high trade costs on these goods; but, when a global pandemic hits, they would be tempted to renege on their commitments and instead decrease trade barriers.

Events such as the current pandemic can lead to increased sentiment against international trade openness. Our research suggests there are no blanket solutions. Trade openness can be effective at addressing local shocks such as domestic pandemics, but it can raise tensions in the context of a global shock such as COVID-19. The design of trade policy agreements needs to be considered carefully to ensure we get the benefits of trade while minimising the potential pain when global shocks hit. This is a key challenge raised by COVID-19—one we should try to meet to avoid falling back into a world with high trade barriers and the large costs that it would entail. In Baldwin and Evenett (2020) several contributors discuss how governments should react to this type of crisis.

Finally, although we do not explicitly model supply chains, our column is related to an ongoing discussion on the disruption of global value chains amid COVID-19. The current pandemic raised questions on the potential vulnerability of relying on foreign supply chains during a global shock, leading to a surge in arguments for protectionism and self-reliance (Bonadio et al. 2020). As Pinelopi Goldberg argues, global coordination is important, given that global value chains can diversify risks through international trade.

2020-06-13||It pains me to say this but Boris Johnson, exhausted and looking increasingly forlorn, appears to have a few short weeks to salvage his reputation and save his Government from ridicule.

Still recovering from his near-death experience with Covid-19, the Prime Minister faces unprecedented obstacles to prevent Britain slipping into a deep recession.

With so many cards stacked against him, our sallow-faced and hollow-eyed leader has squandered much of the goodwill he accumulated after his landslide Election victory in December.

Even his friends whisper that there is no captain on the bridge steering the ship. According to a YouGov poll, Johnson’s handling of the virus is rated as the worst of all world leaders.

Many will discount the criticism as unfair. Contrary to predictions of doom from the Left, the NHS has performed brilliantly.

Eight million workers have been protected by the Chancellor’s £80 billion furlough package. Most of the country is becoming free of Covid. Despite our economy shrinking by 20 per cent in April, it still ticks over.

Johnson’s misfortune is that those achievements have been drowned out by the impression of defeat. Hampered by Downing Street’s cack-handed communications, Johnson is mischievously blamed for orchestrating a shambles.

Some believe his seeming impassivity, sporadic public appearances and blustering press conferences are proof he’s still suffering the after-effects of Covid, combined with sleepless nights with a six-week-old baby.

Some of his harshest critics have boldly stated that if he had still been married to Marina, his long-suffering ex-wife ‘who was unafraid to dispense home truths’, Johnson’s life would be more stable than with a fiancee 23 years his junior.

Such censure, though, ignores Boris’s strength. Over the years, he has successfully compartmentalised his private and public lives.

And since there is no obvious leading Tory who might put themselves forward as an alternative Prime Minister, his supporters are convinced that not all is lost.

Just as his hero Winston Churchill led Britain out of its Darkest Hour in 1940, Johnson needs to summon the courage, ideas and energy to enthuse the nation with a blueprint that will stop us coming out of lockdown in tatters.

He also needs to fire failing Ministers – of which there are several – and Civil Service time-servers on whom he has mistakenly relied.

The fact is he has little time. No later than July 1, just 18 days away, Johnson needs to address Parliament and then the nation on TV to give the country confidence to believe that his Government machine is firing on all cylinders.

We all need to be reassured that we can rely on the Prime Minister to restore normality as quickly as possible.

Johnson’s priorities must be to revive the economy; reopen all schools; launch a major resurgence of Britain’s cultural institutions such as cinemas, museums, concert halls and theatres; encourage pubs and restaurants to reopen; and finally, to rebuild his Government with inspiring and gifted politicians.

It is exactly five weeks ago that Johnson lost his halo. His disastrous TV address changing the slogan from ‘Stay Home’ to ‘Stay Alert’ was confusing, vague and greeted by widespread irritation.

Accused of confusing the message, Johnson lost a huge amount of public goodwill.

Until then, many had tolerated the failure to provide NHS staff with sufficient protective gowns, for example, blaming the global shortage. Many also understood the crisis in privately owned care homes was not politicians’ fault.

But Johnson’s reputation took a second battering. His apparently flippant dismissal of the allegations against Dominic Cummings for breaking the spirit of the lockdown was a self-inflicted disaster that exposed a gross misunderstanding of the national mood.

In the past, he had listened to the advice of loyal friends outside the Downing Street bunker. Suddenly, to avoid criticism, he is shunning their calls.

In explaining his plan to relax the lockdown, the PM needed senior civil servants to deliver a clear, common-sense scheme. But they failed.

In truth, Johnson has been let down by Whitehall’s perennial bunglers. Then he refused to identify and remove the guilty parties.

By character, Johnson has an aversion to confrontation. To date, he has accepted all the scientists’ advice. That must end.

We now know that their advice until mid-March was muddled or even wrong. We also know that the scientists now disagree on the best course forward.

Johnson, in his DNA a libertarian and free-marketeer, must follow his instincts and unshackle himself from the scientists’ chains. He should gamble that the risk of a few extra deaths is outweighed by the urgent need to reopen the country.

Admittedly, confrontation often ends in bloodshed but this is the only way for Johnson to restore his credibility. Simultaneously, he must change his way of governing. Until now, he has delegated most critical decisions to Ministers.

Unwisely, he allowed Home Secretary Priti Patel to announce a 14-day quarantine on travellers entering the UK – something that is unenforceable and has been widely ridiculed.

Similarly, he relied on Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, but he has blundered embarrassingly over the reopening of schools.

And, most alarmingly, he has depended on Health Secretary Matt Hancock to mastermind the ‘war’ against Covid. It is shocking that Britain is third in the world death league from the virus despite only having the 21st largest population.

The public has lost trust in Hancock, of whom retired Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption wrote last week: ‘With his hectoring manner, authoritarian assumptions and snarling threats, [he] has resembled nothing so much as the petulant headmaster of a third- rate school.’

It’s not just ministerial incompetence. No 10 is staffed by people of mixed ability. At its heart is Sir Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary.

Having trained in the Home Office, his specialism is security, which means he’s been poorly equipped to mobilise the Whitehall machine to tackle Covid.

He also neglected to point out to Johnson the dysfunctional performance of senior officials in Public Health England, the Department of Health and hospital trusts.

Johnson should ignore his benign instincts and fire Sir Mark, replacing him with a thrusting agent of change. At the same time, he should replace the senior civil servants at health, education and defence. All have failed to deliver.

Whitehall needs to be revolutionised to get Britain back on its feet.

A litmus test of whether the medicine is working will be when we hear the screams of protest by the Luddite civil service trade unions.

Just three months ago, pre-Covid, the Johnson Government’s first Budget spelled out an exciting One Nation vision.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled a visionary £30 billion plan to rebuild our infrastructure and finance a huge expansion to reboot Britain. The Government should double that investment.

Ministers must learn that we over-relied on the power of globalisation and on China. Of course, that will need an army of experts – so, in the short term, Britain should recruit from around the world.

Spending money to rebuild is easy compared to the parallel task of winning the political battle.

Covid aside, Boris Johnson is under attack by those in denial that the Tories won a landslide Election victory just six months ago and who want to reverse Brexit.

Defeating those enemies requires courage and conviction. No one doubts that Johnson had both these qualities before his illness, but now there are worrying signs he is lacking the energy to fight simultaneously on many fronts.

Indeed, his enemies smell blood. Militant teachers have seized the upper hand and shown that their selfish interests are more important than the education of the nation’s children.

Anarchist mobs have hijacked the Black Lives Matter protests. Michel Barnier, the EU’s Brexit negotiator, thinks he can bully Britain over our exit deal. The BBC has become a mouthpiece for anti-Tory criticism.

Wales, run by Labour, and the Nationalist government in Scotland, are defiantly following different policies from those pursued in London.

Boris Johnson, an acute student of history, will recall he has experienced a similar hiatus. Six months into his time as London Mayor, in 2008, his administration was mired in chaos. Key appointments were exposed as disastrous.

After their swift dismissal, the arrival of a new chief of staff, Simon Milton, transformed Johnson’s mayoralty.

Now, to up his game, it’s not City Hall that Johnson must rejuvenate, but his Cabinet and Downing Street team.

On a personal level, too, Johnson needs to change gear. He must show he is in charge. He must offer a vision and a big strategy.

Above all, it is imperative that the man who has been seen for years as a great communicator actually communicates better.

At least, for the present, he knows that whatever his critics – and they are growing in number daily – throw at him, he is the only politician with the capacity to unify and lead Britain. But even that certainty can quickly disappear.

2020-06-13||World number one Novak Djokovic lost one of his two opening singles matches on Saturday at the charity tournament he organized, and his day got worse when news broke that one of the event's four legs has been scrapped due to coronavirus concerns.

Shortly after beating fellow Serbian Viktor Troicki in his opening match, Djokovic said he was disappointed that the Adria Tour's third leg in Montenegro, scheduled for June 27-28, had been called off.

"I am so sad for the Montenegro leg," he told the Balkan nation's Sport Klub television in a courtside interview in front of a capacity 4,000 crowd.

"We tried everything, but the borders are still not open and we don't have time to organize it all."

With 12,251 confirmed cases and 253 deaths related to COVID-19, Serbia is among the countries whose residents are not allowed to travel to its southern neighbor Montenegro.

Earlier on Saturday, Djokovic's younger brother Djordje and the Adria Tour director, released a statement saying the event's board had decided to scrap the Montenegro leg.

Asked at a news conference after his defeat by Filip Krajinovic whether there was an alternative host nation able to replace Montenegro in a fortnight, Djokovic said:

"We are looking at several alternative options and locations which I don't want to reveal at this point. We are running out of time so we will know where we stand either tomorrow or the day after."

The second leg will be held in Croatia's coastal resort of Zadar on June 20-21 and the final one in Bosnia's Banja Luka on July 3-4.

The tournament, organized by Djokovic while international tennis remains suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has drawn some household names and adopted a more streamlined format than the main tour events.

Sets have been slashed to the best of seven games, with eight players competing in two pools on a round-robin basis.

Having beaten Troicki in straight sets, Djokovic lost 4-2, 2-4, 1-4 to Krajinovic.

Second seed and Austrian world number three Dominic Thiem beat Damir Dzumhur in minutes as the Bosnian retired in the opening set with a hamstring injury, but had to save a match point in his 1-4, 4-1, 4-3 win over Dusan Lajovic.

Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov beat Lajovic in three sets but was stunned 4-1, 4-3 by home crowd favourite Nikola Milojevic - drafted in to replace Dzumhur.

World number seven Alexander Zverev beat Krajinovic 0-4, 4-3, 4-3 and was playing Troicki in a late match starting after midnight local time.

The third-round pool matches will be played on Sunday afternoon followed by a final between the group winners.||1

2020-06-15||The worst is over. Hopefully, we will never again see such a terrible death toll from an infectious disease in Ireland. The response of the public, North and South, has been fantastic. When it comes to safeguarding health, the public has always proven to be more than willing do what is needed to avoid catastrophic illness.

As Shaw wrote over a century ago, the public “dreads disease and desires to be protected against it”. As we have seen, sometimes communities took the initiative themselves, with parents keeping their children out of school and heads closing schools ahead of central instruction.

The numbers of deaths and of new positive cases in Ireland have fallen steadily North and South. As they have reached a low level there is an understandable clamour to get back to normal. The effects of the restrictions on all aspects of life have been immense.

The damage done to businesses and individuals will have health consequences that have yet to materialise or be fully appreciated. The very restricted operation of health services will take time to restore and even longer to deal with the backlogs of routine and even urgent care that have built up.

Psychiatrists have predicted a “tsunami” of mental health problems following the crisis arising from conditions exacerbated or created by all that we have been through.

The bit that no one really wishes to hear and those dutybound to deliver the message keep saying, is that we are not done with this coronavirus yet. As long as the virus is present and is still being transmitted in our communities, workplaces and institutions we risk significant flare-ups.

Importantly, if those flare-ups are not stamped out immediately, the highly infectious nature of the virus has the potential to cause substantially more deaths and disruption.

What is needed, with great urgency, is a concerted effort to achieve a “Zero Covid-19 Ireland”. This will involve getting to zero new cases in both parts of the island and then maintaining and if necessary restoring that position. The resulting economic and social benefits would be enormous.

Arguments about distances of 1, 1.5m or 2m would be a thing of the past and our schools, theatres, arts centres, clubs and pubs could get back to enhancing our lives and reconnecting our communities. There is absolutely no reason why this cannot be achieved.

Two things about this task are very clear. Firstly, lifting a high proportion of restrictions in a country before eliminating the virus is a recipe for playing an ongoing and exhausting game of cat and mouse with this deadly foe. The consequences could be continued, and possibly massive disruption.

The global number of new cases per day continues to grow and resurgence is apparent in some places that have ended lockdown prematurely.

Secondly, as far as Ireland is concerned the task of eliminating all new cases of the virus occurring through domestic spread, ie not coming from newly imported cases, can only realistically be carried out on an all-island basis.

The endgame for Covid-19 is not yet in sight. Researchers around the world are working on the development of more than 135 separate vaccines. There is no guarantee that an effective vaccine will be found and we would be unwise to plan on that basis.

The best option for Ireland is a joint North-South initiative empowered and resourced to hunt down the remaining cases and hot spots for the virus and deal with them as swiftly as possible.

Learning the lessons from countries, such as South Korea and Germany, that are further along the path shows that the capacity to react urgently to any flare-ups must be strengthened and maintained for the foreseeable future.

Changes are, of course, needed to harmonise efforts on the island. These include details that should have been sorted out by now anyway, such as the different isolation times of seven and 14 days on either side of the Border and the fact that “shortness of breath” is a recognised and listed symptom of Covid-19 in the South but not the North. But getting a jointly agreed case finding, testing, contact tracing, isolate, and support (FTTIS) system is the big priority.

In Border counties in particular, the ability to deal with cases and contacts on both sides of the Border in a seamless way is crucial. In doing the job well speed is everything.

Serious east-west issues will arise. As the island gets close to “zero” status the focus will be firmly on stopping the importation on new cases. Agreed measures to prevent the virus being reintroduced via ports and airports will be crucial.

These are not constitutional issues – they are public health issues. They are not about sovereignty – they are about human lives and the preservation of jobs and a functioning economy.

We can revert to tribal allegiances in due course if we really want to, but in the meantime let’s get the job done. Dr Gabriel Scally is president of epidemiology and public health at the Royal Society of Medicine in , London||2
2020-06-15||East Vancouver parent Christa Wagner was a bit hesitant to send her twin eight-year-old boys back to school after being off since March break due to the pandemic, but she can't argue with the results.

"Obviously it's a little bit different, but honestly they loved it. They had so much fun," Wagner said.

The boys are back in class for two full days a week. Normally they share their teacher with 23 other children, but since they've been back at their school, St. Francis of Assisi, classrooms are limited to only eight students.

"It's been fantastic," Wagner said. "The school has done an amazing job."

In March, the provincial government shut down schools to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

Starting June 1, elementary students could return for 50 per cent in-class instruction, while middle and secondary school children were limited to one day a week. Children of essential-service workers and those needing additional supports have been able to attend full-time.

The province says less than a third have returned with more children in elementary school and fewer in secondary school. Numbers also vary from school to school, the province says, and class to class.

Parents, children and teachers are reporting mixed experiences with how that shift has gone so far. One thing that most agree on is that it's been a teachable moment for everyone, with hints of what may come this fall.

Some parents say the routine and structure of school has been helpful for their kids.

Rae-Anne Schneider, whose 15-year-old daughter Neve has Trisomy 9 Mosaic, a rare chromosomal disorder that causes physical and cognitive impairments, says her daughter's been glad to return to school full-time.

"Without the routine it's really difficult for her," Schneider said. "Behaviorally, that gets challenging."

Schneider has been off work for the past couple of months to care for Neve full-time.

As the parent of a child with complex needs, she had support available, but was concerned about the risk of her daughter catching the coronavirus because her immune system is compromised.

When schools opened up again, she felt it was time for Neve to go back.

"I love her to death, but I think sometimes it's good that we get a little break from each other," she said.

For many children who have returned to school, the best part has been reconnecting with their friends and teachers.

"I was really happy to see my friends again and it was easier to work when my brothers weren't annoying," said Lord Selkirk student Oscar Needoba.

In school, children like Oscar have faced what will likely be the new normal for months to come.

Teachers wearing masks, lines painted on the ground to enforce social distancing and desks pushed apart in classrooms are just some measures schools have put in place.

Despite those precautions, many parents say the risks are still too great for their kids to return to school.

Like the majority of parents in B.C., Vancouver mother Victoria Harper chose to keep her twin 10-year-old girls at home. One of them has asthma, she says, and the other was terrified of catching the coronavirus.

"It was such an emotional decision," Harper said.

Life at home, Harper says, has been a surprisingly enjoyable change from the fast pace of pre-COVID life when the family juggled cooking classes, badminton lessons and swimming.

But schooling at home and over the Internet has become a challenge.

"Both of them are at the point where they don't even want to do online schooling right now," she said. "They're just losing interest."

Luckily for Harper, the end is in sight as most classes break for summer on June 25.

Teachers too have had some relief with the return to in-class instruction, but also new challenges.

Terri Mooring, president of the B.C. Teachers Federation, says many teachers say they're glad to see their students again. The new safety protocols were strange for teachers and students alike at first, Mooring says, but everyone has adapted quickly.

The biggest issue Mooring says she is hearing from teachers is that with some students back and others still at home, teachers are doing double duty preparing two types of instruction for the same class.

"It's been incredibly labour intensive and not sustainable," Mooring said. "Their workloads have exponentially increased."

Mooring says it will be important for planning to take place this summer to help teachers better manage their course loads and work schedules.

Like education and school officials, Mooring doesn't yet know what September will bring in terms of in-class instruction. She thinks there will continue to be a mix of online and in-person learning, but she's hopeful conditions for teachers will improve.

"We anticipate that things will be better than they are right now," she said.||0
2020-06-15||Those selected to be privately sponsored refugees must now wait until the Canadian border re-opens before they can commence international travel to Canada. This protracted waiting situation has left many people stranded. Some sponsored refugees have been living in or forced to return to overcrowded refugee camps. Others are waiting in hotels near airports and transit centres. Still others are searching for shelter after relinquishing accommodation prior to their cancelled departure. These already deemed refugees who have been selected for resettlement are being pushed back, which is prolonging their trauma. In these situations, they may face financial challenges, underserved accommodations, and health risks. The suspended settlement operations have also halted family reunification for those privately sponsored refugees awaiting the arrival of family members to Canada.

While sponsored refugees selected for resettlement to Canada are now blocked from entering the country, there are other privately sponsored refugees who have lived in Canada for more than one year and are experiencing the re-bordering of their lives. Since they no longer receive financial support from their sponsors, they are facing employment instability, unable to pay rent, access health care or adequate food for their families due to the coronavirus. Some are relying on their savings, child benefit payments, food banks, welfare, or financial support from family in order to survive.

Since many privately sponsored refugees are engaged in service work, they are particularly impacted as a consequence of reduced openings of several businesses due to the official ban on large gatherings in Canada. For example, some sponsored Syrian refugees who have lived in the Kitchener-Waterloo region have recently experienced unemployment. One Syrian taxi driver was unable to drive a taxi due to the coronavirus. This jobless situation created difficulties for him to pay rent and access adequate food for his family. A Syrian single-mother of three who cleans houses for low wages was unemployed for several weeks. She too has suffered from a lack of income and, until recently, relied on child benefit payments to pay household bills. A Syrian father of four was forced to close his small sewing business for two months. This situation enabled him to apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), but still left him with inadequate funds to support his family.

The eligibility requirement for CERB – that the applicant should earn a minimum employment income of $5,000 in the previous year, creates challenges for those privately sponsored refugees who work intermittently or earn low wages. A representative from the Salmon Arm Refugee Group in British Columbia stated that it is “difficult and time-consuming for privately sponsored refugees to fill out forms for CERB, even with the assistance of their sponsors.” The representative stressed that privately sponsored Syrian refugees are using their child benefit payments to pay for food, clothes, and other expenditures. Yet, many other sponsored refugees have constricted options to look for other jobs and are compelled to work despite growing health risks.

In addition to their precarious employment, sponsored refugees may also face health challenges. Some privately sponsored Syrian refugees living in the Kitchener-Waterloo Region are hesitant to access health care because of their fear of contracting the virus at clinics or hospitals and infecting their family members. Due to practicing physical distancing measures, some sponsored refugees have experienced the triggering of previous mental health issues, including anxiety, solitude, or limited access to support networks.||1

2020-06-15||If there is one voice that has permeated lockdown, it’s Joe Duffy’s. Liveline is of course an Irish institution, but like many things it has taken on an elevated meaning during the pandemic. Its hearth-like ability to form a space where people can gather around and hear a diverse range of voices has once again excelled when it is most needed. Spending a lot of time inside, we look for connections to the outside, and Liveline provides.

Duffy has steered many excellent conversations throughout, be they on racism, education equality, the human cost of the pandemic, and everything in between. The lockdown initially made us appreciate the so-called simple things, but it also allows us to consider what is “simple” as actually complex. Duffy is the most empathic presenter at RTÉ, with the kind of authenticity, sophistication and intuition that validates public service broadcasting as almost beyond an essential service.||2
2020-06-15||[We repeat the reviewers’ points here in italic, and include our replies point by point, as well as a description of the changes made, in Roman.]

We want to thank the editor and the reviewers for their excellent comments and suggestions. We have gone over them all and made changes accordingly. Most importantly, some of the comments have caused an update of the data set, which changes some of the findings and allows us to fine-tune the analysis. Since we initially harvested data in April 2020, PubMed has changed its interface and now provides better (and more consistent) information on author affiliations. This allows a much more precise analysis of author country, as requested by one of the reviewers. This was not possible previously.

We address this data update in the paper, in an effort to be as transparent about the process as possible, but for good measure, we would like to mention here the original sample, which was 9,050 COVID-19 papers, of which 1,179 had gender for first and last author, and at least one US-based author. These numbers are now 15,839 and 1,893 respectively. When analyzing first-authors, we restrict to US-based first authors and vice versa for last authors.

Below, we list the comments from the reviewers and editor in italics and our responses in regular font face.

We have uploaded the data and the analytical scripts to OSF. The project is private right now, but we will make it public when/if our paper is published. An R script is provided, which will allow full analysis from the most raw data set we are able to provide (gender is inferred and information from PubMed is extracted into a table).

2) The robustness of author gender determination is not clear, and the methods should be described in more depth. For example, the text states "Gender was reliably estimated for 81.9% of the entire sample": what does "reliably estimated" mean here? How is the accuracy of the gender estimation tool established? What is the likelihood that a given gender was determined correctly? Doing spot checks of a random sample of authors can be helpful. Additionally, adding more information on the specific methods used for inferring gender from author names would be useful.

Checking the correctness of gender assignment is of course important. Our data relies on an algorithm, which we have previously used and checked for robustness. We realize that this was not apparent from the very short comment in the paper, and have added a little more detail about which algorithm we used and that robustness checks have previously been performed.

We have adjusted the method so that we now only compare US first and last authors. We believe this is a strength of the study because it allows us to isolate the effect to a single country and the timing of both disease and social constraints. For the analysis of the full author group, there could potentially be a bias, which we address in the limitations.

4) I am not convinced by the authors' argument that the observed differences are not due to a specialty bias. By looking at COVID-19-specific papers only, they are looking at the gender distribution of authors in a specific field, and comparing them to the gender distribution of authors in a variety of other fields who happen to publish in similar journals. It is entirely possible that there is a gender bias in coronavirus research, for example- this would not be captured by journal specialty, but would be seen in gender proportions for COVID-19 papers. Please add additional columns to table 1 looking at all research published in these journals in 2020 (not just COVID-19-related research), and/or discuss at greater length the possibility of specialty bias in your results.

While this is certainly an important point, we also have to disagree, for two reasons. COVID-19 specific papers are not from a specific field. On the contrary, the vast majority of medical specialties have picked up research on COVID-19 in one way or another. The search for cures or vaccines are likely limited, but discussions about implications for treatment of other diseases span all of clinical medicine. Secondly, our reason for using COVID-19 research as the “treatment” case was not to look specifically into this, but rather to have a sample of papers where we knew the research would have to be done in 2020. If we introduced a new column of “other” 2020 papers from the same journals, it would be impossible to know which of these had been in the pipeline since 2019 or earlier, and which were actually based on research from 2020.

5) The authors limited their samples to papers with at least one US author. It could be useful to know, of the 1179 papers in the treatment group, how many papers had more than one US author? I'm concerned that this limitation may introduce confounding factors. Knowing how many of these papers were published by teams of scientists primarily working in the US, vs a single scientist working in the US with a larger international team, would address this concern and more strongly support the authors' point that the disparity in female authorship can be potentially linked to the social restrictions in the US.

We hope that the changes to how we analyze first and last authors (analysis of first/last author gender restricted to first/last authors from the US) also addresses this point. For the share of women in the full group, this remains a valid concern, but not one we are currently able to address. While PubMed has now introduced per-author affiliations, it is not realistic to use these to make statistical analyses. When we claim to look only at papers with US-authors, this is really a conservative claim; there are certainly more papers with US addresses, but where the country or state is not included in the affiliation, or included in non-standardized forms. Our database contains more than sixty thousand “countries” from the affiliations, as there is no standard formatting of PubMed affiliations. We have trawled all of these for combinations of “USA”, “United States”, “America”, state names, names of major cities etc., to find the most complete set of affiliations related to the USA. However, we are not able to provide a reliable estimate of the national distribution of affiliations of all authors.||1
2020-06-16||We thank the reviewer for this comment. Unfortunately, we did not manage to knock out PKR in Huh7.5 cells before the lab was closed due to COVID-19. As the reviewer suggests, we do not expect this to make a difference to HCV replication but we have not managed to test this. We have therefore not been able to further study the role of PKR in distinguishing HCV permissivity of Huh7 and 7.5. We believe that this omission does not impact the conclusions in the manuscript. We have re-iterated that the differences between Huh7 and 7.5 cells are multifactorial with the following text:

“Furthermore, our results suggest that a deficiency in PKR-dependent responses, as well as defective RIG-I (Sumpter et al., 2005), may contribute to Huh7.5 cell permissivity for HCV replication, which is consistent with previous observations showing that RIG-I does not play a role (Binder et al., 2007). Indeed, differences in permissivity between Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells are likely governed by a combination of factors, including RIG-I (Sumpter et al., 2005) and CD81 (Koutsoudakis et al., 2007), among others.”

We did over-express PKR in Huh7.5 cells, which inhibited HCV replication. However, we observed that overexpressed PKR was highly active (autophosphorylated) even in the absence of a stimulus, which does not accurately recapitulate the situation in unmodified cells (e.g. Huh7 cells, Figure 7—figure supplement 2A), where PKR is normally inactive (unphosphorylated) until a stimulus is added. Thus, we have not included these particular data in the manuscript as we believe this would complicate the story, without affecting our conclusions about the CypI mechanism. Moreover, these data are similar to those we obtain in the Huh7 PKR KO cells (Author response image 1), which we have included. We have also discussed the issue of over-expressed PKR being constitutively active as relates to these data.

We thank the reviewer for this important comment. The question of re-expression of PKR in the knockout lines is one we had considered. In the original study, we did not test this because we expected that PKR over-expression would induce translation shutdown as has been described previously (e.g. Grolleau et al., 2000), and would confound our results. Nonetheless, we have now stably over-expressed PKR in Huh7 PKR KO cells and evaluated HCV replication and its sensitivity to CsA inhibition. Over-expressed PKR was highly active, as shown by its robust autophosphorylation even in the absence of a stimulus (Western blot in new Figure 7—figure supplement 2). We found that PKR expression had an inhibitory effect on HCV replication, possibly through suppression of host and viral translation (as evidenced by the autophosphorylation of over-expressed PKR). For this reason, this experiment does not strictly recapitulate the situation in Huh7 cells. That is, the over-expressed PKR is already phosphorylated and activated (see Figure 7—figure supplement 2) instead of un-phosphorylated as in Huh7 cells. Therefore, while PKR over-expression reduced HCV replication, it did not affect HCV sensitivity to CsA. We propose that over-expressed PKR cannot enhance CsA sensitivity, because PKR is already activated and suppressing HCV replication independently of CsA-induced antiviral signaling. We had hoped to examine this further, but did not have time before the COVID-19 closure of the lab.

These data are now shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 2, and we have added the following text:

“We also sought to confirm the role of PKR in CypI activity by over-expressing PKR in Huh7 PKR knockout cells. However, PKR over-expression in itself led to PKR activation, as evidenced by its autophosphorylation (Figure 7—figure supplement 2A). […] This is consistent with previous observations of translation shutdown on PKR overexpression (Grolleau et al., 2000; Barber et al., 1993; Chong et al., 1992; Thomis and Samuel, 1992).”

In the manuscript (originally Figure 6D, now Figure 7D), we observed highly similar results in two PKR KO clones, which were prepared by single-cell cloning. Furthermore, treatment of cells with a PKR inhibitor (originally Figure 6G, now Figure 7G) led to the same phenotype. We also have more new C16 data supporting a role for PKR (Figure 7G). Thus, while the PKR reconstitution experiment did not yield clear results, we propose that together, these data are sufficiently compelling.

As described above, PKR over-expression does not accurately recapitulate the situation in naïve cells in that overexpressed PKR is highly active (autophosphorylated) even in the absence of a stimulus. This makes it difficult to evaluate the effect on the sensitivity of HCV to CypI, which we propose relies on more subtle PKR-mediated activation of IRF1, in the absence of translation shutoff. We have instead focused on an alternative approach to provide further evidence for a role for PKR using the PKR inhibitor C16 (Figure 7G).

This is a very helpful suggestion. We have now compared the effect of the C16 PKR inhibitor in Huh7 and Huh7 knocked out for PKR. The result was as expected and PKR knockout prevents the effect of C16 on CsA sensitivity.

These new data are included as Figure 7G. We have added the following to the text:

“C16 decreased CsA potency in Huh7 cells, but not in Huh7 PKR KO cells (Figure 7G), and only minimally affected CsA potency against HCV in Huh7.5 cells (Figure 7—figure supplement 1).”

This is another important point. We have now evaluated the antiviral activities of daclatasvir (NS5A inhibitor) and telaprevir (NS3/4A protease inhibitor) in Huh7 and Huh7 PKR KO cells. As expected, the presence or absence of PKR did not affect HCV sensitivity to these other inhibitors. These data are now shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 3. We have added the following text:

“We next tested whether the absence of PKR broadly affects the sensitivity of HCV to the antiviral activity of telaprevir (NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and daclatasvir (NS5A inhibitor) in Huh7 and Huh7 PKR KO cells. […] Collectively, these data are consistent with a specific role for PKR in the enhanced antiviral activity of CypI in Huh7 cells.”

We have now re-structured the manuscript to present the IFN-β/ruxolitinib data earlier, in what is now Figure 4. We have also sought to clarify that the observed phenotype is not dependent on IFN-β signalling and IFN induced gene expression, but is rather a cell-intrinsic response (i.e., gene expression dependent on PKR-IRF1 activation) with IFN-β being one of many antiviral genes induced upon CypI treatment of Huh7, but not Huh7.5 cells. We now show the activation of other antiviral genes, which are predominantly IRF1-dependent, in Figure 4. To confirm that the effect is not mediated by IFN, we performed further experiments using an interferon receptor (IFNAR) blocking antibody. As for ruxolitinib, IFNAR blockade did not affect the CypI potency against HCV, although it did rescue HCV replication from the inhibitory effect of IFN. This data is presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 3.

We have added the following text:

“The notion that IFN was not required for maximal CypI activity was also supported by an experiment using antihuman interferon alpha/beta receptor chain 2 antibody (IFNAR) to inhibit IFN activity through receptor blockade. […] However, in vivo, IFN induction would be expected to influence HCV replication and adaptive immune responses and thus the antiviral activity of CypI in patients.”

Unfortunately, we did not manage to complete this experiment before our qPCR machine was requisitioned for COVID-19 testing outside UCL. Nonetheless, RLR/MAVS-dependent antiviral responses have previously been documented in Huh7 cells and we have now cited these studies more prominently. We have added new text reiterating this point:

“Huh7 cells are capable of responding to cytosolic RNA and initiating antiviral signalling through RIG-I, MAVS and IRF3 (Sumpter et al., 2005; Binder et al., 2007). […] Therefore, we first hypothesized that the active RIG-I pathway in Huh7 cells contributes to the antiviral signalling induced by CypI.”

We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We attempted to evaluate replication of the Con1 (genotype 1b) replicon (Lohmann et al. 2003 J. Virol. 77: 3007-3019). Despite significant effort, we were unable to get the Con1 replicon to replicate in our Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells. In the past month, we obtained the Huh7-Lunet cell line, which better supports Con1 replication. We were able to observe weak replication in Huh7-Lunet cells, but ran out of time before the COVID-19 lab closure and were unable to evaluate the effect of CypA depletion or CypI treatment in the presence or absence of PKR in the Huh7-Lunet cell line.

Importantly, Kaul et al., 2009, evaluated replication of the Con1 replicon in CypA-depleted Huh7-Lunet cells and Huh7.5 cells. CypA depletion in Huh7-Lunet cells profoundly inhibited HCV replication by approximately 3 logs at 48 hours, and had a lesser impact in Huh7.5 cells (Kaul et al., 2009, Figure 2B). These data suggest that our findings are relevant for other HCV genotypes and we now cite this study to make this point in the Discussion as follows:

“Notably, a differential requirement for CypA in Huh7-Lunet and Huh7.5 cells has also been observed for replication of genotype 1b (Con1) and genotype 2a (JFH-1) replicons (Kaul et al., 2009), suggesting that these mechanisms are consistent across HCV genotypes.”

We agree with the reviewer that we had over-generalized our conclusions and in fact the mechanisms we have identified here may or may not be applicable to other viruses. To address this concern, we have limited our discussion in the current manuscript to HCV, with the exception of where we have cited literature describing other viruses and CypA.

We thank the reviewer for pointing out this lack of clarity in our Discussion. This was partly due to a typographical error where we had mixed up CypA and CypB in the||2

2020-06-16||“I in my chair with such a crew,” says the captain of a cargo vessel in the South Atlantic en route from Bermuda to Singapore. He is eight months into a four-month contract, and almost everyone on board has also already worked at least double his contracted time. He hopes Singapore will accept that sailors who have seen almost no one but each other for months pose no infection risk and permit a crew change. If not, some may refuse to keep working. On June 16th an industry-wide agreement to allow emergency contract extensions expired, but that is no guarantee that ports will open up. “Believe me,” he says, “the situation is critical.”

When Rose George, a journalist, wrote about the shipping industry in 2013, she called her book “Ninety Percent of Everything” to convey its importance to global trade. But during the covid-19 crisis almost none of the mariners who keep the world fed, warmed and entertained have been allowed on shore. At any moment 1.2m are in cargo vessels on the high seas. (Half as many again work on cruise ships or vessels transporting goods within a single country’s territory.) At least 250,000 have finished their contracts and have no idea when they will be relieved. Similar numbers are stuck at home with no idea when they will next get work. Both totals are rising by tens of thousands each week.

In normal times, crewing the world’s merchant fleet is a logistical miracle. Ship-management firms handle the rosters, signing crew on, flying them from their home countries to a convenient port, and getting them off their ships again and on a plane home. Many mariners are from developing countries, in particular India, Indonesia and the Philippines. They often start and end their contracts in hubs such as Dubai, Hong Kong and Singapore. Contracts are typically of three to nine months, with one month’s variation in either direction to make planning easier.

The virus has thrown an almighty spanner in the works. Countries that classified lorry drivers, pilots and cabin crew as essential workers overlooked merchant seamen, even though their work underpins the global economy. Some will accept their citizens, but ships may not be calling at a suitable port, and management companies may not be able to line up relief. With few scheduled flights, the sailors who manage to disembark may not be able to get home.

At first they were proud to be able to help in the global emergency, says Lars Robert Pedersen of , which represents the owners of about 60% of the world’s merchant fleet. They are used to hard work and long contracts. But when official neglect continued, sailors’ morale became a problem. “They are fed every day, and they are getting paid, but that’s not the point,” he says. “They are effectively imprisoned on board their ships.”

Owners and managers are trying to make confinement more bearable with free internet and wage top-ups, says Andreas Hadjipetrou, the managing director of Columbia Shipmanagement. “One captain asked for gym equipment and karaoke,” he says. “The crew created a band and sent us a video clip.” More importantly, they are doing everything they can to facilitate crew changes—which take not just planning, but a hefty dose of luck.

Among the merchant seamen relieved during the lockdown is Hrisheet Barve, a ship’s captain and an Indian from the state of Goa. By the end of May he and 16 crew members, also Indian, were months over contract. Since they were sailing along India’s coast, he proposed to the ship’s management company, Anglo-Eastern, that it divert to the port of Cochin in the state of Kerala for a crew change. The company agreed, despite the cost and delay. Even though the men were all nationals, disembarking required lengthy negotiations with the shipping ministry and port and state officials. They had seen no one else for months, but still had to spend two weeks in quarantine.

By the end, says Captain Barve, he was very worried about his men’s mental state. “When you’re all in the same boat—pun not intended—you can pull each other down.” And tired, miserable sailors are unsafe, he adds. “It just takes one captain to make a mistake and run a tanker aground and cause an oil spill. They will say it was a navigational error but the real culprit will be that he was working way longer than he should have been.”

The International Maritime Organisation, the arm of the that deals with shipping, has drawn up a protocol for crew changes during the pandemic. It requires governments to classify merchant seamen as essential workers, thus enabling them to travel and cross borders. Ports and airports need facilities for testing and quarantine, and safe connections. “We have the standard operating procedure ready to act on,” says Bjorn Hojgaard of Anglo-Eastern. “We just need help from regulators.”

The industry hopes that governments will be prodded into action by the sudden expiry of so many seamen’s contracts. The International Transport Workers’ Federation ( ) says it will support any seamen who refuse to work. If that leaves too few people to operate a ship safely, its insurance policy could lapse, and full liability fall on the captain and owner, who might then decide it was too risky to keep going. The trade that has flowed so smoothly throughout the pandemic might finally gum up. “Everyone is happy to reap the benefits of global trade,” says Stephen Cotton, the ’s general secretary. “But no one seems willing to step up when it comes to safeguarding those who deliver the things they need every day.” ■||1
2020-06-16||HEATHER QUINLAN and Adam McGovern, a couple from Parsipanny, New Jersey, intended to marry in October, amid family and friends. But as covid-19 outbreaks swept through America, that looked unrealistic. “We decided that, since we had no idea when the actual, traditional ceremony would take place, there was no time like the present,” says Ms Quinlan, a writer who, fittingly, has just finished a book about pandemics. Looking for alternatives, they settled on Zoom, the video-calling software that in lockdown has facilitated everything from work meetings to birthday parties. Mr McGovern contacted Parsippany’s mayor, Michael Soriano, who in turn spoke to New Jersey’s governor. He signed an executive order allowing civil marriages to happen remotely. The marriage license was then mailed back-and-forth to witnesses. The couple were married in their home on May 20th by Mr Soriano, dialling in from his office.

In normal times, weddings are big business. Worldwide, the industry is estimated to be worth $300bn a year. Each wedding feeds a constellation of businesses, from caterers and photographers to florists and entertainers. International “destination weddings”, as well as stag and hen parties, are a boon to the travel industry. Those in the wedding business often boast that it is “recession-proof”: people will always want to celebrate getting married. But it is not pandemic-proof. Couples have been forced to choose between delaying their nuptials and finding new ways to wed.

In some countries, disruption began before official restrictions were imposed. An estimated 80% of the world’s wedding gowns are made in China, and those made elsewhere are often reliant on Chinese fabrics and materials. In February, as China closed factories to try and curb coronavirus outbreaks, brides in America and Europe found themselves suddenly dress-less. By April, most nations had instituted lockdowns. Bans on people gathering put paid to conventional weddings: the average American nuptials are attended by 140 guests, according to The Knot, a wedding planning website.

For those set on a big day, the only option is to postpone. Katrina Otter, a planner of luxury weddings in Britain, says that almost all the couples on her books with spring or summer weddings have deferred them until 2021. This is hard on vendors and suppliers, many of whom are self-employed, but the most entrepreneurial have adapted: florists switch to deliveries of flowers and produce; photographers do socially-distanced family portraits; Ms Otter has been training other wedding planners.

Drought now may lead to deluge later. Ms Otter notes that demand for wedding dates next year has rocketed; many venues are already booked up from April to October. (More people may end up marrying on Sundays and weekday weddings.) In post-lockdown China, couples have rushed to wed. On May 20th, China’s own Valentine’s Day, more than 200,000 would-be-weds registered for marriage licences. In the eastern province of Anhui, registrations were up 47% from the same day last year.

Some couples won’t wait. Many of India’s 12m annual weddings are scheduled for astrologically auspicious dates. Plenty fall in the autumn but there is also a cluster in spring, especially in western India. In the state of Gujarat, a reported 30,000 weddings have already been postponed or cancelled. Those determined to keep their dates have begun getting married privately or by video. Shaadi.com, a popular online matchmaker, is running a “weddings from home” service which provides everything from a pandit (Hindu priest) to tutorials from make-up artists. Guests can join in: Anupam Mittal, Shaadi.com’s chief executive, recently participated in a ceremony with 300 online attendees, plus a livestream to thousands more. Such initiatives aid marrying couples but do little to help the informal labourers and vendors who rely on weddings for their livelihood.

Weddings have pivoted to the web elsewhere too. In April New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, issued an executive order, nicknamed “Project Cupid”, allowing couples to apply for marriage licences online from May 7th. (Previously, they had to turn up at the state’s marriage bureaus.) Annie Lawrence, a minister in New York City, is now conducting several Zoom weddings each week. She notes that many couples are motivated, both existentially and practically, by the pandemic. For some, being with the one they love suddenly feels more urgent; and even among romantics, the desire to share health insurance can be a factor. Project Cupid has proved so popular that no more marriage-licence appointments are available until September. Other states, including California and New Jersey, have adopted similar policies.

The speed at which “normal” weddings will resume will depend on how countries ease lockdown measures. Many European countries are beginning to relax the rules about how many people can congregate; Denmark plans to permit social gatherings of up to 500 over the next few months. Some Indian states now allow gatherings of 50 (though, in a country where guest lists can run into the thousands, this will hardly be business as usual). In America, Ohio will allow weddings and receptions of up to 300 people from June 1st, provided guests follow social-distancing guidelines. Weddings without dancing or mingling will not be quite the same.

Yet some may welcome forced simplicity. In Gaza, where the groom traditionally pays, weddings can be ruinously expensive. Thrifty men are reportedly using venue closures as an excuse for smaller, cheaper ceremonies. A Kenyan couple who wed in private, spending a fraction of their original budget, told the BBC that they have been inundated with calls from young people saying they had inspired them not to fall into debt over their weddings. Others may do well to heed their example, even when restrictions lift. One-fifth of the average Indian’s wealth is thought to go to “wedding services”, including matchmaking. In 2018 China’s ministry of civil affairs called for an end to costly weddings, which it said were incompatible with socialist values. In Latin America too, many couples go into debt to get hitched in style.

It is not clear when the global wedding industry will be up and running again. In the meantime, the act of marrying has proved itself adaptable. For her Zoom wedding, with her dress stuck in the shop for alterations, Ms Quinlan wore her mother’s bridal gown and ring. Mr McGovern borrowed his father-in-law’s class ring. During the ceremony, Mr Soriano read a familiar text from St Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians: “Love is patient, love is kind.” The passage continues: “Love...always hopes, always perseveres.”■

2020-06-16||The magnitude of the COVID-induced economic downturn is forcing central banks around the world to rethink the set of monetary policy tools available to them. Many central banks have long shied away from negative interest rates, concerned about the impact on bank profits and financial stability. This column explores how negative interest rate policies can be used by central banks to signal a commitment to a prolonged period of monetary accommodation. Using a quantitative monetary model, it shows that the signalling channel of negative interest rates can result in a rise in banks’ net worth even if net interest margins shrink.

Negative interest rate policies have until now been off the table for many central banks. With the COVID-19 shock and its economic repercussions, however, central banks such as the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve are again putting these and other policies back on the table for discussion.

While the European Central Bank has pursued a negative interest rate policy since 2014, influential papers such as Eggertsson et al. (2017) and Brunnermeier and Koby (2018) have argued that negative interest rates can be counterproductive because of the bank lending channel of monetary policy. The story goes like this: The central bank pays negative interest rates on reserves, while the banks are unwilling (or unable) to pass these onto depositors. As a result, banks’ net interest margins are squeezed, and because of agency frictions in financial markets, there is a contraction in credit creation in the economy.

However, negative interest rates, like conventional monetary policy, work through many channels, including an expectations (or signalling) channel. For a central bank that has a preference for smoothing policy, a cut in policy rates today also signals lower policy rates tomorrow. In our recent paper (de Groot and Haas 2020), we study the signalling channel of negative interest rates and illustrate the conditions under which the expansionary signalling channel dominates the contractionary net interest margin channel.

The qualitative trade-off between the signalling channel and the net interest margin channel faced by an optimizing central bank can be captured in simple variant of the canonical New-Keynesian (NK) model. To do so, we make just two assumptions. First, policy rates can turn negative but household deposit rates cannot. This is a reasonable assumption given empirical evidence from the euro area. The second assumption is that, all else equal, this wedge between a negative policy rate and a zero deposit rate shifts down aggregate demand via a net interest margin-type channel.

The question, in this environment, is whether it is optimal for a central bank to ever set negative interest rates. We establish three results:

1. If the central bank can fully commit to future policy actions, then it has no need of negative rates as a policy tool. It can induce the necessary private sector expectations of the future path of (deposit) interest rates via ‘open mouth’ forward guidance, without resorting to a policy that imposes a cost on banks.

2. Even if the central bank has no ability to commit to future actions (often referred to as discretion or time-consistent policy), it won’t make use of negative rates. In this case, a negative policy rate provides no signal about its future actions and only imposes a cost on the banking system.

So far, the case for negative interest rate policies seems rather bleak. However, these results capture two extreme scenarios. While both are useful benchmarks, neither is likely to be a good description of monetary policy in practice. Our third result builds on work by Woodford (2003) and Nakata and Schmidt (2019) on monetary policy delegation:

3. For a central bank that cannot commit, it is welfare improving to delegate monetary policy to a central banker with a preference for smoothing policy. This policymaker may find it optimal to set a negative interest rate since its preference for smoothing results in an expansionary signalling effect on the future path of interest rates.

Figure 1 illustrates this result. The parameter φ captures the strength of the net interest margin channel. Consider the black line when the signalling channel is weak (i.e. the preference for smoothing in the policymaker’s objective is low) relative to the effect of a squeeze on net interest margins. In this case, the optimal policy (given by the reserve rate), does not turn negative. Consider next the red-dash line when the signalling channel is relatively stronger. In this case, optimal policy prescribes a negative policy rate. While the negative rate does not lower deposit rates on impact since they are constrained by the Zero Lower Bound (ZLB), the signalling channel lowers the future expected path of the deposit rate, boosting aggregate demand today and mitigating some of the fall in output and inflation.

Since Figure 1 is based on a variant of the canonical NK model, it only provides a qualitative insight into the monetary policy trade-off. In the other half of de Groot and Haas (2020), we employ a carefully calibrated medium-scale DSGE model that quantifies the magnitude of the two channels. A key feature of this model is the banking system, which we discuss in more detail below. We also replace the optimal policymaker with an inertial Taylor-type rule.

Figure 2 highlights our baseline result from this quantitative exercise. In this exercise, we introduce a 25 basis point cut to the policy rate which moves it into negative territory, leaving the deposit rate constrained at zero. The policy in our baseline (black line) is expansionary with both output and inflation rising in response to the monetary policy cut. Output rises by eight basis points whereas inflation rises by a little over three basis points. These responses are around 40% of the effect of an interest rate cut in ‘normal times’. The figure decomposes the baseline response into the signalling and net interest margin channels. While the net interest margin channel (red-dash) causes a contraction in both output and inflation (consistent with Eggertsson et al. 2017, Brunnermeier and Koby 2018), the signalling channel (blue-dot) is expansionary and dominates.

Note: Impulse responses to a -25 basis point monetary policy shock at the ZLB. Inflation is annualized.

Figure 3 provides sensitivity analysis. It plots the effect on output of a -25 basis point monetary policy shock for different durations of the ZLB (x-axis); different Taylor rule inertia parameter values (left panel); and different levels of excess central bank reserves in the banking system (right panel). The baseline results correspond to a ZLB event of 4 quarters, a Taylor rule inertia parameter of 0.8 and a reserve-to-deposit ratio in the banking system of 0.2. The effect on output is scaled relative to an unconstrained monetary policy shock rather than in absolute terms, thus removing any “forward guidance puzzle” type effects from the analysis.

There are two takeaways from this figure. First, while under the baseline negative interest rates are expansionary, this is not always the case. If the Taylor rule exhibits less inertia or the economy is expected to remain at the ZLB for longer, the signalling channel is weakened, and negative interest rates may become contractionary. Second, when the quantity of reserves in the banking system is large, the net interest margin channel is stronger and negative interest rates are less effective. This is because negative interest rates act as a tax on banks’ reserve holdings, and when the banking system is awash with reserves (after QE), the tax base is commensurately large.

Note: The x-axis scales with the size of the negative aggregate demand shock that brings the economy to the zero lower bound (ZLB). The y-axis reports the absolute peak response of output to a -25 basis point monetary policy shock in period 1 relative the outcome of the unconstrained (UNC) scenario. The scaling relative to the unconstrained scenario ensures that the results are not a consequence of the ‘forward guidance puzzle’.

A key feature of the larger, quantitative model is the modelling of the banking sector, which closely follows Gertler and Karadi (2011). As such, it is net worth of the banking sector, rather than the net interest margin per se that is key to understanding the effect of negative interest rates.

Figure 4 decomposes the response of bank profits (the change in net worth) to negative interests into several components. Two things stand out: First, while a shrinking of net interest margin pushes down on net worth (yellow bars), irrespective of whether policy features inertia, the signalling channel can have a significant effect on banks’ balance sheets, especially in terms of asset valuations. When there is no inertia and no signalling (right panel), banks’ assets experience a capital loss (blue bars). In this case, bank net worth falls, lending rates and credit spreads rise, choking off investment demand. In contrast, with policy inertia and signalling, despite the contraction in net interest margins, banks’ net worth rises on impact, coming mainly from a capital gain in assets values. In this case, agency frictions in the banking sector ease, allowing lending rates to fall and supporting investment demand and further credit creation via a financial accelerator type mechanism.

Note: The red-dot line plot the impulse response of bank pro

fits to a -25 basis point monetary policy shock at the ZLB. Stacked bars decompose the impulse response for every period.

The current COVID-19 crisis will test central banks’ toolkits to the limit. Negative interest rate policies may help central banks signal their commitment to a prolonged period of monetary accommodation and thus be a beneficial additional policy tool that can be employed.

As policy attention in countries around Europe shifts to mitigating the longer-run impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, a central concern will be to prevent this one-off event from permanently blighting the life chances of the millions of children who missed weeks of school due to the lockdown. Focusing on the UK, this column suggests a way to repair some of the educational damage using small group tutoring, a method with widely proven effectiveness, at a modest cost, and on a rapid but feasible timescale.

Around Europe, it seems that the immediate public health crisis is beginning to fade, although all are braced for a potential second wave of infection. The most intense policy attention needs to focus on mitigating the longer-run impacts of the pandemic. A central concern is to prevent this one-off event from permanently blighting the life chances of the millions of children who missed weeks of school due to the lockdown in the UK. Missed school means lost skills and reduced earnings potential.

Economic analysis suggests the cost of doing nothing is huge. At a personal level, this is manifested in lower earnings potential for the affected cohorts (Portes 2020, Jaime and Willén 2019). This will be reflected at the national level in lower skills: from the mid-2030s, and for the following 50 years, about a quarter of the labour force will have lower skills, implying a 50-year period of lower growth if we do nothing (Burgess and Sievertsen 2020, Hanushek and Woessman 2012). As well as a fall in income, all the evidence to date points to a widening of inequality. One among a number of very recent analyses, the EEF (2020) for example suggest that the attainment gap between poor and non-poor students might widen by 36%. The cumulating nature of skill formation (and skill loss) means that we need to tackle this now. In this column, I suggest a policy solution.

1. The policy intervention must come soon. The process through which skills are formed is dynamic – knowledge builds on knowledge, or as Heckman and colleagues put it, “skills beget skills” . If we do not attempt to catch up the lost learning quickly, that loss will compound and essentially become untreatable. The skill complementarity over time means that if we invest in a 10 year-old today, it will cost less than if we invest when that child is 15 years old to get to the same outcome at age 16.

2. Over the period of lost schooling, schools have provided online resources to children to continue learning at home. There is already evidence (Andrew et al. 2020, Bol 2020) that this has not been very successful, with many families reporting little learning has taken place. So, despite the cost temptation to try to simply catch-up lost skills at home, this will not work. This implies the policy intervention must be school-based, not home-based.

3. It also has to be something new, something extra, and something temporary. This differs from the usual policy question of simply ‘making schools better’. The quest for those policies should go on, but the current situation requires something much more immediate, and immediately effective.

4. While of course it is not true to say that the cost does not matter, we must anticipate that a policy intervention at such scale will not be cheap. Skills have been lost that were to be taught over a 12-week period. Replacing that necessarily takes time, and resource. However, it is clear that the cost to individuals affected and to the UK of doing nothing is dramatically higher.

5. Finally, we must use an intervention that already has substantial causal evidence supporting its effectiveness. This is by no means a trivial requirement. For example, the hundred-plus randomised controlled trials funded by the Education Endowment Foundation show that, in fact, many much-hyped education policies have no effect.

The policy that best fits these criteria is small group tutoring, based in schools.

My proposal is an extensive but time-limited use of small group tutoring in as many of the school years as possible, to remediate the learning loss suffered by the missed months of schooling.

I proposed the use of small group tutoring earlier in this crisis, and here I provide details and cost estimates. Support for a very similar idea is also building in the US, following an earlier proposal from Robert Slavin, Director of the Center for Research and Reform in Education at Johns Hopkins University, and support from leading education economist Susan Dynarski.

Small group tutoring is a flexible approach, with several parameters varying the ‘dose’: the number of pupils per group, the amount of time per session, and the number of sessions. It is fair to say that not all of these dimensions have been fully explored by suitably well-designed experiments. There is robust evidence showing that one-to-one tutoring works, and we can build from there. While effectiveness declines the bigger the group, it seems there are only marginal falls in impact from two in the group to six in the group, and steeper falls thereafter.

Taking a ‘dose’ of the intervention to be half an hour a day, for each weekday, for 12 weeks, there is good evidence that this has an impressive effect on learning. The EEF evidence toolkit estimates that such a ‘dose’ of small group tutoring typically yields an extra four months’ progress in school. Of course, these are all averages, but the rough equivalence between a gain of an extra four months’ progress from the intervention and a loss of three months’ schooling from the lockdown seems appropriate. A thorough and wide-ranging meta-analysis of effective educational interventions with robust evidence in the US (Fryer 2016) also concludes that interventions that “implement ‘high-dosage’ tutoring tend to demonstrate large effects” (p. 6), reporting very high pooled impacts from 0.78 to 1.58 standard deviations.

It is not possible here to set out how it would all work. But in Burgess (2020) I have provided some ideas on what some of the main features might look like, including who the tutors would be, the timeline, the selection of pupils, and so on.

Most of the cost of this scheme is the time of the tutor. The extra tuition would take place in the pupil’s usual school, after school, and while this would likely generate additional costs, these would be relatively minor. The EEF have estimated a cost for small group tutoring: for the dose noted above, they estimate a cost of £700 by adding up the time and taking it relative to the annual workload of a regular teacher. This is clearly subject to a number of uncertainties, not least how the different groups are bundled up into jobs, and the level of training of the tutor (discussed below).

Table 1 presents some rough estimates of what the overall cost might be.

They key parameters to be chosen are:
• First, what fraction of a cohort would be involved? I have chosen here 40% since we know from the accumulating evidence that not many families and pupils made a success of home learning.
• Second, group size obviously has a clear and straightforward impact on costs and a much vaguer effect on learning; I have chosen five in the example.
• Third, we need to decide which cohorts to include, within schooling up to year 11. Ideally, all cohorts would be helped, but for this example I have chosen six: years 1, 2 and 3 in primary schools and years 7, 10 and 11 in secondary schools. For the cost per group, I have taken the EEF figure of £700 per group per ‘dose’.

The total is £222 million. This figure is very modest – less than 1% of the overall schools’ budget. It suggests that the possibility of involving all the cohorts should be considered, raising the cost to around £410 million.

There are other ways of approaching this, also with merit, but I believe that this proposal has the greatest likelihood of success; I briefly discuss those in Burgess (2020).

Younger generations will pay a heavy price for our response to this virus. In this column, I suggest a way to repair some of the educational damage using small group tutoring, a method with widely proven effectiveness (four months extra learning), at a modest cost (less than 1% of the schools budget), and on a rapid but feasible timescale (start in October, finish by Easter). Many details would need to be decided, but the bones are here to make a start.

2020-06-16||The Australian dollar rallied overnight having slipped back below 0.68 US cents throughout the domestic session. Risk assets suffered early as investors grappled with reports out of the US and Beijing citing new coronavirus hotspots. In the US 20 states recorded an increase in the spread of Covid-19 cases while Beijing reported a string of new cases after almost 2 months without new infections. The news served as a stark reminder of the risks of opening to quickly and forced markets to check expectations for H2 economic activity. Further downward pressure came following rumours China is considering targeting Iron Ore as diplomatic tensions increase. China’s dependence on the raw material has meant it was considered free from heightened diplomatic hostilities, however if China’s program of restrictions and tariffs does extend to Iron Ore the Australian Economy almost certainly suffer more than China. Having slipped to intraday lows at 0.6780 risk assets found support overnight as the FED announced it will begin buying individual corporate bonds, increasing the scope and scale of its bond buying program. With additional cash set to be in play markets bought the dip and pushed the AUD back through 0.69 to intraday highs at 0.6920.

Attentions today remain squarely affixed to risk. Investors will be keenly attuned to the RBA minutes for any guidance on monetary policy. A sustained risk on move could help the AUD edged back toward 0.70, while a shift in sentiment will likely prompt a move back below 0.69 US cents.

The risk on move overnight saw haven assets close the day lower as investors jumped back into to risk and growth correlated currencies. The USD was the weakest of the majors with the dollar index falling half a percent, while the JPY and CHF also shifted lower. The Dollar came under heavy selling pressure after the FED announced it would expand its bond buying program to include individual corporate bonds. The expansion of its monetary policy program emboldened investors to buy the dip and jump back into risk correlated assets as the availability of cash and central bank funding will seemingly continue through the medium term.

With little of note on the macroeconomic docket today attentions will remain with the broader risk tone. The Bank of Japan’s monthly policy meeting will likely pass without incident while US retail sales are unlikely to tip the scales. The market continues to largely ignore backward looking fundamentals instead looking to sentiment and forward guidance as markers of future performance and signals guiding the speed of any economic recovery. That said a strong retail sales print could bolster risk appetite as consumer spending increases amid easing restrictions.

The UK claimant count will also provide a valuable insight into the health of the labour market. A front runner to official unemployment numbers it offers a sneak peak as to the trend of labour market performance. A print above 400,000 will add mounting pressure to the GBP as it continues to struggle with the coronavirus and opening up the broader economy.

2020-06-16||Inequality and poverty effects of the lockdown in Europe

Enforced social distancing and lockdown measures to contain COVID-19 restrict economic activity, especially among workers in non-essential jobs who cannot ‘telework’. These have implications for inequality and poverty. This column analyses the capacity of individuals in 29 European countries to work under lockdown and the potential impact of a two-month lockdown on wages and inequality levels. There will be substantial and uneven wage losses across the board and poverty will rise. Inequality within countries will worsen, as it will between countries although to a lesser extent.

The economic impact of COVID-19 is dramatic. The global economy is expected to shrink by 3% this year. Asia will not have economic growth for the first time in 60 years, the US and European economies are projected to contract between 6% and 8% (International Monetary Fund 2020), and global job losses are estimated to be over 200 million (International Labour Organization 2020).

The economic effects of the pandemic, however, will not be equally distributed (Dorn et al. 2020, McKibbin and Fernando 2020) and are likely to have distributional implications (Furceri et al. 2020, Lustig and Mariscal 2020).

Our findings strongly support this statement (Palomino et al. 2020). We estimate that the burden of the pandemic will be disproportionately borne by low-wage earners which, in the absence of compensating policies, will significantly increase poverty and inequality across Europe.

The lockdown and partial closure of economic activities were crucial to stop the pandemic and save lives, but their economic effects are likely to diminish economic cohesion between and within European countries.

Teleworking and lockdown ability to work in Europe

Even without considering the subsequent effects that may occur on the demand side (del Rio-Chanona et al. 2020), the lockdown and social distancing imposed by governments to limit the spread of COVID-19 have direct asymmetric effects on the labour market: in principle, only the jobs that can be done from home (‘teleworkable’) are unimpeded by the lockdown. Some occupations like health services and food sales are considered essential, so workers are not affected by their capacity to work from home. Meanwhile, certain economic activities like hospitality are closed under a lockdown and working is not at all possible.

To measure the capability of each worker to keep active under the lockdown, we calculate a ‘lockdown working ability’ index of workers (see Palomino et al. 2020). This measure takes into account the level of teleworking for each occupation (Dingel and Neiman 2020) and whether the occupation is considered essential or closed.

As shown in Figure 1, the average lockdown working ability index varies significantly across European countries with the Netherlands (0.61) the best prepared and Bulgaria (0.37) the worst prepared.

In Table 1 we highlight that our index varies significantly not only by country but also by:
• Gender: Women are less affected by social distancing than men.
• Type of job: Temporary and part-time workers are in general worse-prepared than their permanent and full-time counterparts.
• Education: There is a strong positive relationship between the level of education and the capacity to work under a lockdown in all European countries.

Teleworking capability is strongly correlated with higher wages both across occupations and across average levels by country (r = 0.76). However, the correlation between the lockdown working ability index and the average annual salary in a country is positive but very small (0.06).

Once essential and closed occupations are taken into consideration, the changes in wage inequality caused by the lockdown are difficult to foresee based only on the average level of ability to work under lockdown, and one needs to look at how potential wage losses are distributed.

Because not all workers are able to perform their job at home and some activities are closed, there will be potential wage losses for a significant part of the labour force that cannot fully work during the lockdown.

To simulate these wage losses, we consider several possible scenarios. Here, we show the results for (i) two months of lockdown and (ii) two months of lockdown plus six additional months of de-escalation with only partial functioning of the closed activities (80% of capacity).

Although each European country may have followed slightly different lockdown and de-escalation strategies, we simulate the same scenarios for all countries to ensure that differences across countries are exclusively due to their productive structure.

After ordering workers by wage centiles, we represent the relative change in their wage in ‘lockdown incidence curves’ (Figure 2), which makes it easy to appreciate which part of the wage distribution (low, middle, high) suffers the largest relative wage losses.

For a lockdown of two months, wage losses are sizeable across the wage distribution but vary significantly with the centile, being above 10% (of the annual salary) at certain percentiles in some countries.

Figure 2 Lockdown incidence curves in Europe (two months of lockdown)

Notes: The four panels show lockdown incidence curves (wage distribution versus wage loss, two-month lockdown scenario) for different groups of countries with similar curves.

As noted above, there is no straightforward relationship between the average wage of a country and its distribution of wage losses. Thus, we observe that the distribution of wage losses is similar for Norway and Greece (panel b), and Ireland and Cyprus (panel c), despite the fact that these countries have significantly different average wages.

Changes in poverty and wage inequality

The lockdown increases poverty in all countries. First, we find a 10.0% mean loss rate (P) for poor workers − those below 60% of the median wage − for the average of European countries under a lockdown of two months. This mean loss rate for poor workers goes up to 22.5% when an additional 6-month period with partial functioning of closed activities is considered. The mean loss rates are also sizeable by country (Table 2).

Second, the proportion of poor workers (headcount index, H) increases significantly for all European countries. The average increase is 4.9 percentage points under two months of lockdown and 14.5 percentage points with an additional partial closure period of six months.

These values imply that − in the absence of counteracting government measures − the percentage of poor people in Europe may substantially increase, even if lockdown does not last long.

By country, under the two-month lockdown scenario, we find the highest increase in poverty in Croatia by the headcount index, and the smallest increase in Switzerland.

When comparing wage inequality after the lockdown with the baseline, we observe that inequality increases in all European countries (Table 2). The countries with the lowest increases in the Gini coefficient under a two-month lockdown are the Netherlands (2.2%), Norway (2.3%), France (2.3%), Switzerland (2.6%), and Germany (2.6%). On the other extreme of the spectrum, we find Cyprus (4.9%), Czechia (4.8%), Hungary (4.7%), Slovenia (4.7%), and Slovakia (4.6%).

With an additional six-month period during which closed activities are functioning at 80%, the countries with the lowest increases in the Gini coefficient are Denmark (9.5%), France (9.9%), the Netherlands (10.5%), the UK (10.8%), and Germany (10.9%). Countries with the highest increases are Slovakia (21.2%), Cyprus (20.0%), Hungary (19.6%), Czechia (16.0%), and Slovenia (15.9%).

Table 2 Poverty and inequality changes in Europe

Notes: P is the mean loss rate for the poor, H is the headcount index, and G is the Gini inequality index. CL is partial closure, while 2m refers to 2 months. ∆RG is the relative change in the Gini index.

Finally, wage inequality both within and between European countries increase under a two-month lockdown, but inequality of wages inside countries increases more (5.04%) than inequality between countries (2.44%). Countries’ average wages diverge with the lockdown, although the main change in wage inequality happens within (not between) European countries.

In sum, our analysis reveals that the lockdown and de-escalation periods will potentially increase poverty and inequality sizeably in all European countries, even without accounting for second-round effects. Given that early relaxation of containment measures could have devastating effects for the health of citizens, we advocate for public policies that alleviate the distributional consequences that the lockdown may otherwise have.

2020-06-17||Recent academic discussions have sought to understand whether the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis and associated lockdown should be ascribed to demand or supply shocks. This debate is of some importance since the underlying shock can have significant implications for stabilisation policy. This column tries to answer these questions by using data on hours worked and wages to estimate labour demand and supply shocks for the aggregate economy and for different sectors through an econometric model. It finds that while labour supply shocks accounted for a larger share of the fall in hours, both shocks were important.

In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, governments and public health authorities around the world implemented confinement and mitigation measures such as social distancing. These measures effectively led to the controlled shutdown of entire sectors of the economy, especially those that supply economic activities and services involving high physical contact with other people, such as restaurants, hairdressers, airlines, etc. On one hand, authorities forced many such establishments to close and send their workers home (the so-called lockdowns). On the other hand, consumers themselves also reduced their consumption of these services, regardless of public health policy recommendations. Furthermore, as workers in some of these services lose their jobs and income, they also reduce their purchases of other goods and services. This, combined with uncertainty about the evolution of the pandemic, leads to a reduction in demand for goods and services across the board, affecting not just these locked down sectors (Gourinchas 2020).

For this reason, most economists would agree that the economic effects of the outbreak and mitigation measures combine aspects of so-called ‘supply’ and ‘demand’ shocks (Baldwin and Weder di Mauro 2020). A supply shock is something that reduces the economy’s ability to produce goods and services at given prices. Public health authorities and employers preventing service workers from doing their jobs can be thought of as a supply shock. A demand shock, on the other hand, is something that reduces consumers’ ability or willingness to purchases goods and services at given prices. People staying at home and not going to restaurants or movie theaters for fear of contagion is an example of a demand shock. Additionally, as service workers lose their jobs they may stop purchasing other goods such as cars or appliances, which can also be thought of as a demand shock in those specific sectors.

Conventional monetary and fiscal policy can be used to offset aggregate demand shocks, but other policies may be more appropriate to stabilise the economy after a supply shock. Understanding whether a shock is caused by supply or demand is therefore very important for the design and implementation of stabilisation policies. Due to the nature of this specific shock, it is not clear that the government wants to stimulate/stabilise activity in certain service sectors, as that could run counter to the objectives of public health policy. The government could, however, target policies (such as fiscal or credit policy) to sectors that are not part of the lockdown but are subject to aggregate shocks. This implies that it is not just important to understand whether this shock in the aggregate has to do with supply and demand, but it is also crucial to understand this at the sector level (Guerrieri et al. 2020).

In a recent paper (Brinca et al. 2020), we try to answer these questions by using data on hours worked and wages to estimate labour demand and supply shocks for the aggregate economy and for different sectors, using an econometric model. The basic assumptions we use for identifying supply and demand shocks are very simple: if we observe hours and wages (prices and quantities) moving in the same direction, we assign more probability to those movements being caused by a demand shock. On the other hand, if we observe hours and wages moving in opposite directions, we assign that to a supply shock.

Figure 1 plots the shock decomposition we estimate for March 2020, when the lockdown began, for the growth rate of hours worked. The sum of the red and blue bars is the percentage point change in the growth rate of hours worked relative to its historical average; the size of the red bar relative to the blue bar shows how important supply shocks were relative to demand shocks in that sector. The first ‘sector’ is total private employment, and our results show that two-thirds of the decline in hours were attributable to supply shocks. By far the most affected sector was leisure and hospitality, where the growth rate of hours worked fell by almost ten percentage points. Again, supply played a slightly larger role than demand. While most sectors experienced negative supply shocks, some sectors experienced positive demand shocks; for example, retail trade likely benefitted as people stopped going to restaurants and started buying more groceries and cooking at home. The information sector also benefitted, likely due to increased interest of firms by telework software and arrangements.

Figure 2 repeats the exercise for April 2020, the first full month of lockdown. The total effect on hours worked during this month was much larger across sectors, with total private employment falling by almost 17 percentage points. Again, for most sectors, two-thirds of the decrease seemed to be associated with supply. Also, during this month, the positive demand shocks in sectors such as retail and information vanished, or even reversed.

There are some potential caveats with our approach, ranging from potential nonlinearities caused by such large shocks (our model is linear), and composition effects driving the joint dynamics of hours and earnings. To address these, we take our estimated measures of shocks in April 2020 and compare them to a sectoral measure of how many jobs can be done at home (Dingel and Neiman 2020), something that should affect labour supply more than labour demand. We show that there is a stronger (positive) correlation between the April 2020 supply shocks and the fraction of jobs that can be done at home. We believe that this helps validate our methodology and decomposition.

All in all, our results seem to suggest that labour supply shocks accounted for a larger share of the fall in hours caused by the pandemic shock in the months of March and April, but that both shocks were important. In particular, there were significant demand shocks in sectors that should not be directly affected by the lockdown, such as manufacturing. This suggests that targeted stabilisation policy could help assuage some of the effects of the current crisis.

1 For example, a recent paper (Andersen et al. 2020) compares personal expenditure between Denmark, a country that imposed a lockdown, and Sweden, a country that did, and finds that consumption expenditures fell in both countries by similar amounts.

2 We apply the methodology of Baumeister and Hamilton (2015), who estimate a Bayesian structural vector-autoregression of the labour market. The SVAR models the joint dynamics of the growth rate of hours and real wages.

3 Furthermore, when we remove leisure and hospitality, which is a clear outlier, the correlation between supply and this measure of telework remains while the correlation between demand shocks and this measure vanishes.||0

2020-06-17||On 15 April 2020, WHO received information regarding a confirmed case of yellow fever in Magandi village, Tchibanga city in Nyanga Province of southern Gabon, 590 km from the capital, Libreville.

The case is an 83-year-old male with no known vaccination history for yellow fever. He had onset of symptoms on 30 January 2020 and presented to a health facility on 2 February 2020 with abdominal pain and jaundice. Between 2 February and 9 April, he consulted the Urban Health Centre in Tchibanga, the Christian Alliance Hospital in Bongolo and the University hospital in the capital Libreville where the case received anti-malarial treatment and remained hospitalized until his death on 9 April 2020. On 14 April 2020, the laboratory results received from the WHO Regional Reference Laboratory at the Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, confirmed yellow fever infection, by seroneutralisation test. The additional differential diagnostic tests performed were negative for dengue, West Nile fever, chikungunya, Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic fever, Zika and Rift Valley fever.

On 15 April 2020, a multi-disciplinary investigation was conducted in Tchibanga by the Ministry of Health (MoH) with technical support from WHO. According to the field investigation report, the case had no recent travel history prior to the onset of illness and no additional cases were found in the community despite extensive case finding activities.

The last cases of yellow fever in Gabon were detected in 2019. These two confirmed cases of yellow fever were in unvaccinated international workers in the health district of Mitzic, Woleu-Ntem Region.

The yellow fever vaccine was introduced into routine immunization in 2000. Yellow fever vaccination coverage in Gabon is reported to be suboptimal (less than 85%) (WHO/UNICEF estimates, 2018). The case is from Mongo health area, where vaccination coverage is 76% in 2020.
• An epidemiological investigation was conducted in the case’s village of residence.
• An entomological survey is being planned.

Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease that has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact in unvaccinated populations.

The detection of the confirmed case of yellow fever in Nyanga Province shows the possibility of spill-over of sylvatic yellow fever in endemic areas to unvaccinated people in a rural area even in the context of moderately high population immunity (70%). This highlights the importance of achieving and maintaining high population immunity in all high-risk areas for yellow fever.

There is currently a risk of disruption to routine immunization activities due to COVID-19 related impacts on the health system and a decreased demand for immunization due to physical distancing requirements or community reluctance. Disruption of immunization services, even for brief periods, will increase the numbers of susceptible people and the likelihood of outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases. As of 12 June 2020, there have been 3,463 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Gabon.

Gabon is a high priority country for the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemic (EYE) strategy. Vaccination is the primary intervention for the prevention and control of yellow fever. In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. WHO and partners will continue to support local authorities to implement these interventions to control the current outbreak.

WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travellers to Gabon, from nine months of age.

Yellow fever vaccination is safe, highly effective and provides life-long protection. In accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005), the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever extends to the life of the person vaccinated. A booster dose of yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry.

WHO has published guiding principles for immunization activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and has developed specific operational guidance for conducting mass vaccination campaigns in the COVID-19 context. The EYE Strategy will support rapid resumption of preventive yellow fever activities according to WHO guidance.

WHO encourages its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures, including vaccination. Travellers should also be made aware of yellow fever signs and symptoms and instructed to rapidly seek medical advice if experiencing signs and symptoms suggestive of yellow fever infection. Travellers returning to Gabon who may be infected with yellow fever may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present.

WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to Gabon on the basis of the information available on this outbreak.

The world’s most sensitive dark-matter experiment might have found a hint of the stuff — although the data it has collected so far could be a statistical fluctuation or a spurious signal. The data collected in 2017-18 by the underground XENON1T experiment have revealed an excess in the number of particles hitting its liquid xenon, with a relatively low energy. The finding suggests the possible existence of a hypothetical particle called the axion. “You cannot overstate the importance of the discovery, if this is real,” says particle physicist Adam Falkowski. But another possible explanation is the presence of radioactive impurities. An upgraded version of the detector called XENONnT could solve the riddle next year.

Even if a screening test is very accurate, if it is not 100% perfect then it will deliver some false positives and some false negatives. And the lower the infection rate, the more likely it is that a positive result is wrong. An imperfect antibody test for COVID-19, for example, could leave a lot of people thinking that they are possibly immune to the disease, when they have never even had it. Scientific American explains, with a very handy graphic, how this mind-bending fact arises.

In early April, the international response to the coronavirus pandemic slashed daily global carbon emissions from fossil fuels by roughly 17%. Now emissions are rebounding, with China almost back to pre-pandemic levels. The European Union is leading the way to a green recovery with a proposed US$826-billion recovery package aimed at expanding renewable-power generation, retrofitting old buildings and investing in cleaner fuels. Experts estimate that 2020’s global emissions will be down around 5% compared with last year’s — the biggest drop since the Second World War, but still not nearly enough.

In this Nature video, we test a home testing kit that is being sent out across the United Kingdom as part of the government’s testing programme for coronavirus antibodies. And we speak to public-health researcher Christina Atchinson about the REACT (real-time assessment of community transmission) study, run by Imperial College London. (Nature || 4 min video)

The masses of user data collected by technology companies are providing social scientists with tools to do studies they have been dreaming about for more than a century: from the psychology of morality, to how misinformation spreads, to the factors that make some artists more successful than others. The goldmine of information has produced controversies and raised privacy concerns. And part of the community is resisting the flood in “a power struggle within the social-science camp”, says analytical sociologist Marc Keuschnigg. “Who in the end succeeds will claim the label of the social sciences.”

Many of the drugs under scrutiny for fighting COVID-19 are anti-inflammatory agents. Researchers hope that these could keep in check the runaway immune responses — called cytokine storms — that seem to cause dangerous respiratory problems in some people. But a growing number of frontline critical-care physicians are advocating a more nuanced approach. They say the goal should be to nudge people towards a ‘Goldilocks’ level of immune activity: not so hot as to cause organ failure, and not so cold that the virus can run amok.

By failing to support their universities, countries are undermining their own plans to boost research, argues a Nature editorial. It calls for students and universities to be eligible for the same kinds of temporary emergency funding as other industries are asking for. In the meantime, senior academics need to speak up for staff on short-term contracts. And everyone should look out for students, who are the ‘guinea pigs’ for the new normal.

Mass violence and unjust laws have affected the productivity of African American inventors, found economist Lisa Cook when she analysed patents filed between 1870 and 1940. But Cook came away baffled when reviewers showed no understanding of the history of Black people in the United States, or how their experiences could be meaningful to other people. The experience revealed how economics’ lack of Black representation and disdain for research about racism is inhibiting the field.||0
2020-06-17||Linda Djougang listened and learned how to pronounce Saoirse, Aoife, Caoimhe, Siobhán. She has a simple request. Say her name like she can say yours.

In Djougang’s essay, reacting to the murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement, the international prop and frontline nurse succinctly captures life as an immigrant growing up in 21st century Ireland.

The 24-year-old arrived from Cameroon on August 15th 2005.

“That day changed my life forever,” she writes. “I flew here by myself at the age of nine. Ireland was a completely different world. I had to grow up so much that day.”

Djougang, who joined her father’s family in north county Dublin, believes her “childhood was taken” by the change.

“Where I was raised [in Cameroon] our family are your neighbours! You can’t say you don’t have a family because your neighbours are your family, your neighbours are like your parents, like mom and dad. That’s how I was raised.

“I remember my first day in Ireland and I was asking my dad, ‘can we go and play with the neighbours?’ and my dad was like, ‘no, you can’t play with the neighbour, this is not Cameroon.’ It was really like, ‘this isn’t how life here works’.”

Now in the final year of her nursing degree, Djougang has been working in Tallaght Hospital on a ward that treats positive cases for Covid-19.

Her first experience of racist abuse happened while playing football with the boys in primary school.

“It’s really sad because I felt like I really wanted to respond back but I can’t because I will get in trouble. You can’t fight back because you already know that you’re different.

“When you open your eyes, you see that there is not enough diversity in everything that we do. Sometimes I feel uncomfortable because people will look at you, probably asking, ‘what is she doing here?’ And that’s hard. That is so hard. That’s why I tell people, ‘try and live in my shoes just for one day and see what it feels like being black, being different’.

“I have sat down on buses and someone asked me, ‘are you black? The colour of your skin is so dark!’ and I’m thinking, ‘are you ignorant or what?’ But you can’t talk. I just go on about my day.”

Djougang, whose words were published on the Leinster website alongside a piece by Ireland winger Adam Byrne, touches upon a repetitive theme when it comes to racism in Ireland: “If some people have put in their head that they are not racist then you’re putting it in your head that you don’t need to change or you’re refusing to consider it. This is a bigger issue than ourselves.

“George Floyd’s life shouldn’t have been taken for people to start talking. ‘This is not right’ – it hasn’t been right for generations.

“You either want to make a change or you just don’t. This thing will never go away. For centuries, my grandma, her grandma, and her grandma have relived it.”

Byrne is more hopeful racial equality can become a reality in his lifetime – stating his “experiences have been 99 percent positive” growing up in Kildare – and he believes “from America to Ireland, and worldwide” that some day there will be “no inherent bias.”

But Djougang keeps returning to a lack of willingness by Irish society to educate children about African culture.

“We are not born to be racist. We’re not born to harm others. But it’s the system that we live in that affects us. People say here they want to educate themselves but where do you even start?

“For example, my hair. People are like, ‘can we touch your hair? How come your hair is long today, how come it’s short?’ Because you don’t understand my culture. You don’t understand my hair texture. You’re not educated about me. But I know everything about your hair.”

Echoing the lyrics of Zambian-Irish rapper Denise Chaila’s new song (C.H.A.I.L.A), she concludes with a cutting observation about how white people refuse to learn how to say her name.

“I would try and pronounce your name right. Names, like Caoimhe, Saoirse, Aoife. I will pronounce your name right but please pronounce my name too. I go home and I practice your name. I don’t tell you that I’ll go home and practice your name, but God damn, I do it.

“Because I want to treat you the same way as I would like to be treated too. So when I go home I will write your name several times and pronounce it and come to you the next day and pronounce your name.

2020-06-17||AUD/USD struggles to retain the rebound from earlier this week amid renewed cases of COVID-19 in China, Australia’s largest trading partner, and recent developments in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) warn of a larger correction in the exchange rate as the indicator falls back from overbought territory and offers a textbook sell signal.

AUD/USD pulls back from the weekly high (0.6977) after showing a limited reaction to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Minutes, but the update to Australia’s Employment report may influence the exchange rate as the economy is expected to shed 125K job in May.

At the same time, the jobless rate is projected to increase to 7.0% from 6.2% in April, which would mark the highest reading since 2002, and the ongoing slump in the labor market may drag on the Australian Dollar as it puts pressure on the RBA to further support the economy.

However, it remains to be seen if the data will influence the monetary policy outlook as RBA “members agreed that the Bank's policy package was working broadly as expected,” with the minutes from the June meeting revealing that the “Bank had purchased government bonds on only one occasion since the previous meeting.”

It seems as though the RBA has little intentions of implementing more non-standard measures as “it was possible that the downturn would be shallower than earlier expected,” and Governor Philip Lowe and Co. may continue to tame speculation for additional monetary support amid the success in keeping the yield for the 3-year Australian Government bonds around 25bp.

In turn, the RBA appears to be on track to carry out a wait-and-see approach throughout the remainder of the year as the central bank pledges to “not increase the cash rate target until progress is made towards full employment,” but the threat of a protracted recovery may force the central bank to further support the Australian economy as fiscal stimulus programs like the Jobkeeper Paymentis set to expire on September 27.

With that said, AUD/USDmay struggle to hold its ground ahead of the next RBA meeting on July 7 as the renewed cases of COVID-19 in China undermine the scope for a V-shape recovery in the Asia/Pacific region, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) warning of a larger correction in the exchange rate as the indicator falls back from overbought territory and offers a textbook sell signal.

2020-06-17||In 2005, Hurricane Katrina drowned New Orleans, Louisiana, killing hundreds of people, destroying thousands of homes and ejecting more than 90,000 African American residents. Then-president George W. Bush called it “a tragedy that seems so blind and random”. Not so, as historian Andy Horowitz documents disturbingly; much of it was human-led. New Orleans has seen 92 hurricanes or tropical storms over 300 years, including one in 1915 that prompted the city’s expansion. Most housing built after 1915 flooded in 2005, unlike most built before.

Butterflies charm like no other insect. The “real butterfly effect”, argues journalist Wendy Williams in her enthusiastic portrayal, is “the joining together of countless people of many different nations” to protect this creature — including many scientists. In 1862, naturalist Henry Walter Bates came to the rescue of Charles Darwin’s recent, controversial On the Origin of Species. He showed that harmless Amazon butterflies mimic the colours of toxic species to protect themselves. “Deceptive dress”, said a delighted Darwin; “scam artists”, writes Williams.

From the 1940s, radiocarbon dating gradually transformed archaeology. Now, geographic information systems are transforming the past again, using technologies such as satellite imagery and 3D laser scanners. In his impassioned study written to change popular perceptions of archaeology, anthropological archaeologist and science-fiction lover Mark McCoy argues that treasure maps are giving way to maps for time travellers. “It is time”, he writes, “to say, ‘Goodbye, Dr. [Indiana] Jones. Hello, Doctor Who.’”

History has seen four waves of US higher-education institutions: colonial colleges; state-chartered colleges and universities of the early republic; land-grant colleges and universities established in the Civil War; and major research universities founded in the later nineteenth century. The “fifth wave” proposed (pre-COVID crash) by president of Arizona State University (ASU) Michael Crow and colleague William Dabars, with ASU as its prototype, aims to serve students currently excluded by background and parental income.

“Epidemics happen for a reason,” writes Ross Slotten, a gay man and family doctor in Chicago, Illinois, who treated people with AIDS in the 1980s and still works with some of the 40 million globally living with HIV. He singles out as causes: ease of international travel; increased promiscuity; rapid spread of other sexually transmitted infections; political failure to authorize funding early enough; and the disruption of traditional life by colonialism and civil wars. All resonate through his powerful, humane and stylish memoir.||1
2020-06-18||Our meta-analysis showed that renal impairment in patients with COVID-19 is common. The manifestations of kidney damage are diverse, ranging from abnormal urine analysis, elevated sCr or BUN levels, to AKI and renal failure for which CRRT is required. Among these renal impairments, abnormal urine analysis is the most frequent. 57.2% patients have proteinuria, in which mild proteinuria (+) as well as moderate or severe proteinuria (++ to +++) account for 38.8% and 10.6%, respectively. Cheng’s study has found that compared with patients without proteinuria, patients with proteinuria+ and ++ to +++ had a 1.5-fold and fivefold increased risk of death, respectively, indicating that proteinuria is an independent risk factor for in-hospital death of COVID-19 patients [2], so more attention should be paid to urine analysis in clinical practice.

Another main kidney damage manifestation was elevated sCr and BUN levels with incidence rate of 9.6 and 13.7%, respectively. Elevated sCr and BUN levels may be due to chronic kidney disease or AKI. Cheng’s study showed that the baseline sCr was elevated in 15.5% COVID-19 patients on admission; patients with elevated baseline of sCr were more likely to develop AKI and more severe AKI. Meanwhile, elevated baseline sCr and BUN levels was an independent risk factor for hospital mortality [2]. Therefore, we should increase more awareness to COVID-19 patients who had elevated baseline sCr.

Our meta-analysis showed that the averaged incidence of AKI was 4.5%, ranging from 1.3 to 36.4% dependent on the different severity of the illness. The exact pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated AKI is unclear. Based on the results of our meta-analysis in combination with our frontline experience, we consider that the etiology of renal impairment is likely to be diverse and multifactorial. Besides the direct attack by the SARS-CoV-2, hypoxia and hypercoagulability also contribute to kidney damage.

It has been reported that in the kidney, angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) is highly expressed in the brush border of proximal tubular cells but not in glomerular endothelial and mesangial cells [29], which could explain the fact that the main feature of kidney injury is the damage of renal tubules. Zhong’s team in Guangzhou has also successfully isolated SARS-CoV-2 from the urine sample of an infected patient [30]. It also has been found in the kidney biopsy that SARS-CoV-2 antigens accumulated in kidney tubules in situ [31, 32]. These evidences supported the notion that SARS-CoV-2 can directly attack human kidney. In addition, COVID-19 patients exhibit obvious hypoxia symptoms and renal tubules are more susceptible to ischemia and hypoxia compared to glomeruli. Moreover, COVID-19 patients mainly showed hypercoagulant states with elevated levels of D-dimer, leading to the slow blood flow velocity in the capillaries around the renal tubules and increased risk of microthrombus formation as confirmed by autopsy results [33].

In contrast to the previous study showing that median time for the occurrence of AKI from symptom onset were 20 and 16 days in SARS and MERS patients, respectively [1], Cheng et al. have found that AKI developed 6 days after admission in most COVID-19 patients while only 2 days after admission in patients with elevated baseline of sCr [2]. Our meta-analysis also revealed that the incidence of AKI was more than fivefold higher in severe cases and non-survivors than that in non-severe cases and survivors. Since severe COVID-19 is commonly complicated with ARDS which has high demand for fluid management, optimizing fluid volume and maintaining hemodynamic stability are crucial to prevent the occurrence or progression of AKI. In addition, appropriate anticoagulant therapy might help to reduce the microthrombus formation and to alleviate renal injury.

Our meta-analysis also showed 15.6% non-survivors received CRRT, while 0.4% survivors needed CRRT, which indicated that COVID-19 patients complicated with AKI have a poor prognosis once CRRT is applied. As existing studies have not provided detailed information about survivors and non-survivors experiencing CRRT, further research is needed to determine whether early renal replacement therapy could improve the prognosis of COVID-19 patients complicated with AKI.

The number of studies included was limited in terms of sample size, data availability, and methodologic quality, as most of the patients were from China. It will be better to include more studies with a broad geographic scope, to get a more comprehensive understanding of acute renal impairment in COVID-19. In addition, more detailed patient information, particularly regarding the risk of AKI and the relationship of comorbidities with AKI, was not available in most studies at the time of analyses. Another limitation of this study is that some articles have provided median and interquartile ranges but not mean and standard deviation of the sCr and BUN values. The mean and standard deviation for those data has been estimated in this study based on the median and the interquartile range, which might lead to inaccuracy to some extent.||2
2020-06-18||The COVID-19 Catastrophe: What’s Gone Wrong and How to Stop It Happening Again Richard Horton Polity (2020)

Since the coronavirus crisis began, Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of leading medical journal The Lancet, has been tearing across the British public sphere. Here he is on the BBC, the national broadcaster, there in the pages of The Guardian newspaper — taking the government to task for failures that have left the United Kingdom with the world’s second-highest per capita COVID-19 death toll so far (Belgium is top). Horton has never shied away from controversy (his journal published the retracted, fraudulent paper by Andrew Wakefield that alleged a non-existent link between vaccines with autism) or crusades (against the Iraq war and for political action on climate change). In coronavirus, he has found a cause that matches his energy: the Lancet journals are pumping out both the latest research and his pointed critiques of government policy; and last month, he reviewed a new book by the Slovenian Marxist philosopher Slavoj Žižek that imagines economic and social worlds after COVID-19.

Now Horton has a book of his own. The COVID-19 Catastrophe is a sort of history, diagnosis and prescription, in real time. It is wide ranging, querying the changing role of international cooperation and the fallout of austerity economics, and taking a deeper dive into China’s scientific and political response to the crisis than most Western media have offered. But the book returns again and again to the catastrophe in both the United Kingdom and the United States. It is haunted by the question: how did two of the richest, most powerful and most scientifically advanced countries in the world get it so wrong, and cause such ongoing pain for their citizens?

We were warned what to expect in the pandemic, shows health-care league table

The easy answer is in their leadership. Horton levels the accusation that US President Donald Trump is committing a “crime against humanity” for defunding the very World Health Organization that is trying to help the United States and others. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in Horton’s view, either lied or committed misconduct in telling the public that the government was well prepared for the pandemic. In fact, the UK government abandoned the world-standard advice to test, trace and isolate in March, with no explanation, then scrambled to ramp up testing in April, but repeatedly failed to meet its own targets, lagging weeks behind the rest of the world. A BBC investigation in April showed that the UK government failed to stockpile neccessary personal protective equipment for years before the crisis, and should have been aware that the National Health Service wasn’t adequately prepared.

Politicians are easy targets, though. Horton goes further, to suggest that although scientists in general have performed admirably, many of those advising the government directly contributed to what he calls “the greatest science policy failure for a generation”.

Again using the United Kingdom as an example, he suggests that researchers were insufficiently informed or understanding of the crisis unfolding in China, and were too insular to speak to Chinese scientists directly. The model for action at times seemed to be influenza, a drastic underestimation of the true threat of the new coronavirus. Worse, as the UK government’s response went off the rails in March, ostensibly independent scientists would “speak with one voice in support of government policy”, keeping up the facade that the country was doing well. In Horton’s view, this is a corruption of science policymaking at every level. Individuals failed in their responsibility to procure the best scientific advice, he contends; and the advisory regime was too close to — and in sync with — the political actors who were making decisions. “Advisors became the public relations wing of a government that had failed its people,” he concludes.

The situation deteriorated to the point that former UK chief government scientific adviser David King set up an alternative scientific-advice committee on 3 May to both be more transparent to the public and exercise the independence of mind and tongue that he felt the official committees had ceded. It is a move Horton approves. It’s not clear that the group has swayed government policy, but it has given the public and the media a stable and open source of scientific information.

Elsewhere, the book discusses places with less-egregious failures, such as Spain and France, and the rare successes, such as New Zealand, and Kerala in India. Horton is fond of a tight timeline, and after experiencing the past six months through the fragmented lenses of social media and short news reports, it is a minor, but not insignificant, relief just to have all these events collected in one place, in order.

We practised for a pandemic, but didn’t brace

Such synthesis is a bulwark, too, against the blizzard of misinformation — the ‘infodemic’ — that has blanketed the crisis. Horton rightly points out that it isn’t just quacks and conspiracy theorists promulgating false information. There is a chilling effort by governments as well. Examples include the United Kingdom’s bizarre recent assertions that it never pursued a ‘herd immunity’ strategy, despite both the prime minister and a scientific adviser discussing it in public, and the Chinese authorities’ gagging of physician Li Wenliang, who tried to raise the alarm at the very beginning of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.

The book is weakest where it discusses the future. This is unsurprising — no one knows how this calamity will end. Horton is of the camp that believes there is unlikely to be a return to normality. “Perhaps Covid-19 represents an impermeable boundary between one moment of our lives and another. We can never go back,” he writes. His recommendations for the future are largely admirable — a more-connected and conscientious public, a more-communitarian government, a more self-critical scientific elite. But there is little structure or path for getting there. I, too, want the United States to be a better global citizen, without a president such as Donald Trump. Sadly, I struggle to imagine how it will happen.

Like much of the scientific work produced during the pandemic, this book is a rushed product — not subject to the exacting standards of more normal times. But like the scientific work, it is vital and up to the minute. Early on, Horton paraphrases the mathematician and writer Adam Kucharski, saying “if you’ve seen one pandemic, you’ve seen … one pandemic.” What is imparted now won’t necessarily help us next time, and we’re still in the swell of this one. The events the book recounts are barely cold, and the powerful whom it critiques are still in power. It has lessons that are useful right now.||1
2020-06-18||Resilience versus robustness in global value chains: Some policy implications

Some governments assert that global value chains create economic vulnerabilities in times of a pandemic. This column, taken from a recent Vox eBook, examines recent experiences and the risk-management literature. It concludes that it is a mistake to equate self-sufficiency with robustness – putting all the eggs in one basket is still not a good idea. It is also a mistake to focus on production location when the imperative is to radically scale up production of vital medical supplies. Importantly, international supply chains will be needed to produce the billions of doses of COVID-19 vaccine we will soon need to manufacture and distribute.

With the COVID-19 crisis, a new debate has emerged with respect to global value chains (GVCs), examining whether excessive globalisation of production has not created new economic vulnerabilities. For example, Beata Javorcik recently wrote in the Financial Times that “businesses will be forced to rethink their global value chains” and that “while just-in-time manufacturing may be the optimal way of producing a highly complex item such as a car, the disadvantages of a system that requires all of its elements to work like clockwork have now been exposed”.1 Even the World Economic Forum has recommended to “aggressively evaluate near-shore options to shorten supply chains and increase proximity to customers” as a response to COVID-19.2

This column first appeared in the Vox eBook COVID-19 and Trade Policy: Why Turning Inward Won’t Work, available to download here.

While some lessons will have to be drawn, and both firms and consumers are likely to make different choices after the crisis, it may be premature to call for the end of GVCs or to conclude that shorter supply chains would be less vulnerable. This chapter reviews the relevant management and business literature and highlights evidence to show that the relationship between GVCs and resilience or robustness in the supply of inputs is more complicated than it looks. Even in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, we see how efficient GVCs are in answering the most urgent needs of countries. Policies in the future should support business efforts to build more robust and resilient supply chains and not add to health and other dangers a policy risk built on misconceptions about GVCs.

The vulnerability of supply chains during COVID-19

What are we exactly talking about when speaking of risk? On the supply side, firms face risks such as plant fires, natural disasters, financial risks, political instability, cyber-attacks, quality issues with suppliers and delivery failures. On the demand side, those risks include reputation of products, new competitors, policies restricting market access, macroeconomic crisis, and exchange rate volatility.

COVID-19 is first and foremost a global health crisis and has impacted the production of firms in GVCs in several ways.
• Production was stopped or disrupted because firms were directly affected by the presence of the virus at production sites.

Whether it was a decision coming from the government or from the firm itself, either there was a need to stop producing or to maintain production with new rules guaranteeing the safety of employees (with an impact on production such as delays or reduced output). This type of risk is related to the production site and applies to all firms in the same location. However, firms that source inputs from different locations confront an additional risk - even if the virus does not affect the production site, they nevertheless need inputs originating from a potentially affected area.

This is a supply chain risk. For example, such risk materialised in the fourth week of January 2020 when China decided to lock down the city of Wuhan and start taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus to the rest of the country. Manufacturing companies in the rest of the world (unaware at this stage of the tsunami that was about to hit them) were quickly hit. Car manufacturer Hyundai halted all production in Korea on 7 February 2020 due to a shortage of components coming out of China. This type of contagion flowing through GVCs has also been observed with some natural disasters, such as the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in 2011, or the floods in Thailand that same year.

Within a matter of only a few weeks during February 2020, the virus spread rapidly to other regions, first to Europe and then to North America. Such was the speed of its spread that supply chains were hardly disrupted. It wasnít until 19 March that Ford stopped its production of cars in both North America and Europe. And there only four days separated Volkswagen closing its factories in Europe (17 March) and in the US (21 March).3 And whether domestic or not, suppliers of parts and components also closed their plants because they were affected by similar measures - not because their inputs could not be delivered; the contagion became more of a concussion (Baldwin 2020).

Transportation is also a source of risk. For those companies still producing during the lockdowns (and possibly for all companies once lockdowns are lifted and the virus is still present), the vulnerability of international supply chains will depend on whether international transportation networks are still operating and without significant increases in trade costs.
• While limiting trade in goods was not part of the health response (with the important exception of export bans and restrictions to trade for some key medical supplies and medicines), measures taken by governments limiting the movement of people or reinforcing border controls have, to some extent, led to the disruption in international trade.

Trade in services is directly impacted when it relies on the movement of consumers (e.g. tourism) or the movement of producers (e.g. many business services but also transport services).

Goods are moved across countries through services, and trade in goods is indirectly impacted by the measures affecting (those) services. This is especially the case for air freight, which has been relying on cargo holds in passenger planes and is favoured during the crisis to reduce the delivery time of key inputs and supplies. Quarantine measures for air or sea crews and additional sanitary controls related to COVID-19 (or measures to protect the people in charge of controls) are also delaying trade.

While domestic transport networks and logistics are also disrupted, there is an additional vulnerability for international freight and a risk specific to international production networks. However, it is difficult to assess the level of disruption to international trade currently. Most logistics firms report no strong impact on their operational capabilities with the exception of some air routes or specific destinations that may be more impacted by the virus.4 Volatility in freight rates has risen, but with falling demand, international trade costs are more likely to decrease than to increase.

All the above risks are on the supply side and were mainly the focus of most debates on the level of vulnerability in international supply chains. However, on the demand side, an even greater risk may be on the horizon – culminating in a profound worldwide economic crisis triggered by lockdowns and restrictions to movement of people (which also restrict consumers ability to consume).

Contagion through GVCs will again become a concern if regions lift these restrictions sequentially and if the economic impact, although profound, is more or less severe across different areas. The mechanisms, which were observed during the 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis via contagion through declining demand and amplification effects (Bems et al. 2009) will resurface. However, the COVID-19 crisis is of a different nature, with the recession likely to stem from services and domestic activities rather be associated than trade finance issues, as in 2008-2009. The macroeconomic implications are also different (Guerrieri et al. 2020).

No current evidence that complex supply chains are more impacted by COVID-19

Numerous statements have been made about complex value chains being more impacted during the COVID-19 crisis, possibly due to additional risks and costs related to international trade.5 However, the available evidence – while limited at this stage ñ does not support such a view. The most impacted industries are those relying on the movement of people, such as hotels and restaurants, or passenger transport. And for countries under a lockdown, the bulk of the impact is through the fall in domestic demand and not international tourists.

The most impacted industries are those relying on the movement of people, such as hotels and restaurants, or passenger transport. And for countries under a lockdown, the bulk of the impact is through the fall in domestic demand and not international tourists.

Figure 1 is based on World Bank estimates of the economic impact of COVID-19 made on Thailand (Maliszewska et al. 2020). This country is an interesting example due to its integration in manufacturing GVCs as well as tourism activities. For each sector, the decrease in output is the consequence of some level of under-utilisation of capital and labour, increase in international trade costs, and a decrease in any activities that involve proximity among people. As the pandemic is still ongoing, these figures are model predictions only and not observed data. They are plotted against the import intensity of production, which can be interpreted as an index of the level of fragmentation of production (Timmer et al. 2016). Data come from the OECD Trade in Value-Added (TiVA) database.

2020-06-18||The Swedish policy response to Covid-19 is exceptional by international comparison. This column explains how the approach is decided by three articles in the Swedish constitution. The first guarantees the freedom of movement for Swedish citizens, ruling out nationwide lockdowns. The second establishes unique independence for public agencies, allowing them to design the policy response to the pandemic. The third grants exceptional powers to local government. In addition, the Swedish approach is fostered by strong trust in the government.

Covid-19 has triggered drastic policy measures in many countries, including lockdowns and severe restrictions on the freedom of movement of people. Sweden is one clear exception to this pattern: no nationwide mandatory lockdown has been enforced. Swedes are able to move freely within their country as well as across the Swedish border – although they are likely to be stopped from entering other countries.

True, there are restrictions concerning the maximum size of public gatherings. Restaurants that do not adhere to social distancing rules can be forced to shut down. High schools and universities have been closed while daycare facilities and elementary schools have remained open. Still, the public authorities rely essentially on recommendations and information concerning hand-washing, social distancing, self-isolation, travelling and working from home rather than on any legally binding measures.

The Swedish approach of keeping an open society during the pandemic has drawn immense international interest. Why is the policy response in Sweden so different? Many explanations for its exceptionalism have been presented. As a rule, the main reason for the Swedish policy response has not been brought out. It is dictated by the legislative framework, more precisely by the rules of the constitution concerning the freedom of personal movement and concerning the independence of public authorities and of local authorities.

A lively debate about the pros and cons of the Swedish approach has evolved in terms of public health outcomes. However, these consequences are not dealt with here. Instead, my focus is solely on the determinants of the Swedish policy response to Covid-19.

The economic consequences of the present pandemic are enormous. These are determined to a large extent by the measures taken by government authorities, which in turn depend on the incentives and restrictions facing policymakers. Thus, the institutional framework for the policymaking process is the key to understanding the whole Covid-19 story for Sweden.

The role of the constitution

Two paragraphs in the Swedish constitution dictate the character of the policy response. The first concerns personal freedom of movement and the second concerns the particular independence enjoyed by public agencies or authorities. In addition, the constitution gives extensive powers to local government in designing policy measures regarding public health issues, in this way limiting the role of the central government.

The Swedish government is not allowed to declare a state of emergency in peacetime. Thus, the main factor behind Swedish exceptionalism during the present pandemic is that the Swedish constitution prohibits the use of lockdowns as seen from Chapter 2, Article 8 in the Swedish constitution (Regeringsformen).

Everyone shall be protected in their relations with the public institutions against deprivations of personal liberty. All Swedish citizens shall also in other respects be guaranteed freedom of movement within the Realm and freedom to depart the Realm.

The above paragraph thus guarantees full freedom of movement for Swedish citizens within Sweden and across the Swedish border under peacetime conditions. The paragraph is not absolute. There are exceptions for example for prisoners and conscripts for military service, as stated in Chapter 2, Article 20-21 in Regeringsformen. Local restrictions on the movement of people can be adopted for health reasons. However, there is no exception for a contingency like a pandemic. Thus, these rules cannot be adopted for a full nationwide lockdown similar to those put in place in other countries.

The Regeringsform (Chapter 2, Article 24) allows the government to restrict the freedom of meeting and of demonstration due to an “epidemic”:

Freedom of assembly and freedom to demonstrate may be limited in the interests of preserving public order and public safety at a meeting or demonstration, or with regard to the circulation of traffic. These freedoms may otherwise be limited only with regard to the security of the Realm or in order to combat an epidemic.

The freedom of assembly has also been restricted by a ban of all public meetings with more than 50 participants as part of the government’s strategy to deal with Covid-19.

The constitution guarantees the independence of public agencies

Public agencies are independent from the government in their daily business according to the constitution. The tradition goes far back in history. A first step was taken in the Regeringsform of 1634 designing the structure of public agencies after the death of King Gustavus Adolphus II in the Thirty Years War while Crown Princess Christina was coming of age. A second step was the Regeringsform of 1720, following the death of Charles XII, restricting the power of the King and establishing independent public agencies.

Today, the Swedish system is based on administrative dualism, where the public agencies are set up outside the ministries of the central government. As stated by Nergelius (2018: 300), the independence of public agencies from the government “is unusual or even unique in an international perspective”.

As explained in the English introduction to the Regeringsform, the government

has no powers to intervene in an agency's decisions in specific matters relating to the application of the law or the due exercise of its authority. In many other countries, it is common for an individual minister to have the power to intervene directly through a decision in an agency's day-to-day operations. This possibility does not exist in Sweden, however. Collective Government decision-making and the ban on instructing agencies on individual matters are expressions of the prohibition of 'ministerial rule', as it is often called.

This approach reflects the wording of the constitution in Chapter 12, Article 2 of the Regeringsform:

No public authority, including the Riksdag, or decision-making body of any local authority, may determine how an administrative authority shall decide in a particular case relating to the exercise of public authority vis-à-vis an individual or a local authority, or relating to the application of law.

The constitution thus prevents interference by ministers of government in affairs that are assigned to various public authorities. Public agencies are given a status to some extent similar to the independence of the courts and of the Riksbank, the Swedish central bank. Still, the government appoints the heads of public agencies, determines their budgets and the legislation relevant for their tasks.

The Public Health Agency of Sweden (Folkhälsomyndigheten) is such a public authority, now in charge of framing and designing the policy response to the pandemic. It is run by experts in epidemiology, not by political appointees. The collaborative work of health economists and epidemiologists at the Swedish Public Health Agency has produced a response that considers the overall impact of its measures and recommendations.

To sum up, the constitution insulates the public authorities from direct political meddling to a much greater degree than in any other democracy, allowing experts to design the policy response. Although the government is not formally bound to follow the recommendations of public agencies, by tradition this is the case.

The constitution guarantees self-government at the local level

In addition, the Swedish constitution gives a strong role to local self-government. This tradition goes back to the late Middle Ages. The autonomy of the local authorities is anchored in Chapter 14 in Regeringsformen on local authorities.

Art. 2. The local authorities are responsible for local and regional matters of public interest on the principle of local self-government.

Self-government through the municipalities at the local level and the regions at the regional level actually covers the major share of the large Swedish public sector, including the healthcare sector and the care of the elderly. Thus, the power of the central government in these health-related areas is limited by the independence of the local authorities. This decentralised structure of 290 municipalities and 21 regions contributes to the exceptional Swedish response to the pandemic.

As the Swedish constitution prohibits the use of lockdowns and state of emergency as policy tools, the government has to rely primarily on information and recommendations to influence the behaviour of the public. The impact of this type of policy tools is closely related to the degree of trust in society.

The Swedish public holds a strong trust in public institutions, in government effectiveness and honesty, in the accountability of elected politicians, in the democratic process and in the rule of law. This can be seen from the Eurobarometer surveys covering all EU member states. Here the Swedish respondents display a high trust in their national government, while citizens in many EU member states hold considerably lower trust in their governments (as demonstrated in Figure 1).

Even if Brazil can be regarded as having an avant-garde position on Venezuelans’ legal protection in the region; severe social vulnerability of this population is the norm. The scenario is complicated even further when considering the above mentioned reality of Roraima. This complex setting led to tensions between the national population and Venezuelans, with escalating xenophobia and discrimination. The situation could not be placated even with the presence of international organizations that tried to improve integration. The first sheltering initiatives were especially precarious and unhealthy. An already saturated health system was a continuous point of contention, as well as the lack of job opportunities.

As a response to this context, in 2018 the Brazilian government established Operação Acolhida – led by the Office of the Chief of Staff (of the Presidency) with a strong participation of the Army - focusing first on the ordering of the border, which led to the creation of sheltering spaces with more resources and more personnel, as well as collaboration with NGOs and international organizations. As a second step, Operação Acolhida initiated the interiorização of Venezuelans, meaning their redistribution into other Brazilian states, aiming to diminish the pressure in the border state. Operação Acolhida and its several actions has been considered a good practice, however it has not been able to eliminate social conflicts and xenophobia (even by the local government), which can have disastrous results in light of COVID-19.

Besides these aspects, one also notices bad practices in terms of borders, protection of vulnerable groups, government responses and overall attitude towards COVID-19.||0

2020-06-18||SSE Enterprise Telecoms, one of the UK’s leading connectivity providers, today announces its role in working with long term partner NYnet to support infrastructure development of an NHS Extended Access Hub in North Shields, Tyne and Wear in the North East of England. The hub was established to help medical staff support COVID-19 patients that required treatment in a secure facility but were not deemed as needing urgent hospital care.

 

 In order to successfully set up the new site, robust, resilient and above all reliable connectivity was required. It was agreed that Ethernet would be the best solution to facilitate the needs and requirements of the on-site medical professionals. Ethernet provides a reliable and stable service whilst also enabling the provision of high bandwidth speeds to support on-site systems & processes.

 

 Having worked with SSE Enterprise Telecoms for a number of years, NYnet contacted its provisioning team to acquire the technology, highlighting the importance of quick delivery of this service to support the COVID-19 response. A typical timeline for the sourcing and deployment of an Ethernet connection of this type, taking into account the need for third party collaboration and coordination, can take, on average, between 40 and 60 days. Given the critical importance of this particular project, SSE Enterprise Telecoms accelerated timings as much as possible.

 

 Thanks to the skill and effort of the front office team in manually working alongside industry partners, delivery of the circuit was completed in just eight working days. Once the circuit was deployed, NYnet was able to quickly install a router and connect the site to the Health & Social Care Network (HSCN).

 

 Simon Willmott, Sector Director for Service Provider at SSE Enterprise Telecoms said:

 “We are living in challenging times, where the reliance on our blue light services has never been so great. When NYnet reached out to us for Ethernet connectivity, we did everything in our power to work with providers across the industry to make the deployment of the project as quick and painless as possible.

 

 “The successful completion of this deployment has been a real team effort and is a testament to the commitment of businesses across the sector in coming together during the pandemic to make sure the lives of those on the front line, and their patients, are a little bit easier.”

 

 Zoe Oxley, Senior Project & Deployment Manager at NYnet said:

 “The Extended Access Hub is a critical component in the North East’s fight against COVID-19. As soon as the medical team reached out to us for connectivity support, we understood the importance of procuring and delivering a reliable connectivity solution as quickly as possible.”

 

 “Having worked with SSE Enterprise Telecoms on previous circuit deliveries we knew of the benefits of the LIVEQUOTE portal, but not even in our wildest dreams could we have predicted an eight-day turnaround from order to completion. This well managed, smooth process is a great display of how the industry can support our front-line key workers, should we all pull together.”||2
2020-06-18||T a lot going on in Britain in early March. London staged an England-Wales rugby match on March 7th, which the prime minister attended along with a crowd of 81,000; on March 11th Liverpool played Atletico Madrid, in front of a crowd of 52,000 fans, including 3,000 from Spain; 252,000 punters went to the Cheltenham Festival, one of the country’s poshest steeplechase meetings, which ended on March 13th.

As Britons were getting together to amuse themselves and infect each other, Europe was shutting down. Borders were closing, public gatherings being banned. Italy went into full lockdown on March 9th, Denmark on March 11th, Spain on March 14th and France on March 17th. Britain followed only on March 23rd.

Putting in place sweeping restrictions on everyday life was a difficult decision, fraught with uncertainty. Yet the delay is just one example of the government’s tardiness. Britain has been slow to increase testing, identify a contact-tracing app, stop visits to care homes, ban big public events, provide its health workers with personal protective equipment ( ), and require people to wear face coverings on public transport. As this wave of the disease ebbs, Britons are wondering how they came to have the highest overall death rate of any country in the rich world, and why leaving lockdown is proving so difficult.

The evidence so far suggests that the British government played a bad hand badly. The country was always going to struggle. The virus took off in London, an international hub. Britain has a high proportion of ethnic-minority people, who are especially vulnerable to the disease. And Britons are somewhat overweight, which exacerbates the impact of the infection.

Britain has got some things right. Its researchers have been in the forefront of the race to find drugs and create vaccines against the disease. On June 16th a trial by Oxford University, the first to identify a life-saving medicine, showed that a cheap steroid can reduce mortality among the sickest patients by a third. A swift reorganisation of the National Health Service put paid to fears that it would be overwhelmed. But the government has wasted the most precious commodity in a crisis: time. In a federal system, like America’s, the central government’s failings can be mitigated by state and local authorities. In a centralised system, they cannot.

Hindsight is a fine thing, and offers a clarity that is absent in the blizzard of events. Yet it is now plain that Britain’s scientists initially argued for the wrong approach: accepting that the disease would spread through the population, while protecting the vulnerable and the health service. Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, estimates that had Britain locked down a week earlier, at least half of the 50,000-or-so lives that have been lost would have been saved. This is more Britons than have died in any event since the second world war.

In retrospect, the government should have probed the scientists’ advice more deeply. Some of it was questionable. The received wisdom that people would tire of social distancing, and that shutting down early would mean loosening early too, was just a hunch. Even after the evidence changed, and it became clear the country was heading for catastrophe, the government was slow to impose the sort of lockdown seen across Europe.

Yet you do not need hindsight to identify other mistakes. Delays in fixing supply chains, promoting face coverings and increasing testing capacity were clearly errors at the time. Despite the urging of the country’s scientists and the World Health Organisation, by the middle of April Britain was still carrying out just 12,000 tests a day, compared with 44,000 in Italy and 51,000 in Germany. Because most testing was reserved for hospitals, care homes struggled to find out which of their residents and staff were infected. Competition for was fierce, so they also struggled to get the kit they needed to protect their workers.

The government is not solely to blame. The pandemic made new demands on the system. Some crucial bits of machinery did not work. The publicly owned company which supplies the health service with failed. Public Health England, which was responsible for testing and tracing, failed. But there was a failure of leadership, too. When systems break it is the government’s job to mend them; when the evidence argues for drastic measures ministers need to take them.

Britain is still living with the consequences. The spread of the virus and the devastation it has wrought have made leaving lockdown difficult, as shown by the halting return of pupils to school. Only five year-groups have gone back, many parents are choosing to keep their children at home, and the government has abandoned an earlier ambition to get more in. The “world-beating” contact-tracing system still lacks its app, which is not due to arrive until winter. Slow progress at suppressing the virus will have grave economic consequences, too.

These shortcomings have claimed many victims. Among them is public trust. Britain went into this crisis with a powerful sense of unity and goodwill towards the government. Now Britons think worse of their government’s performance during the crisis than do the citizens of any of 22 countries polled by YouGov, aside from Mexico. That reflects the government’s mistakes and its hypocrisy, after the prime minister’s main adviser broke its own rules about when to travel—and kept his job. While the world waits for a vaccine this lack of trust will make managing the disease a lot harder.

The painful conclusion is that Britain has the wrong sort of government for a pandemic—and, in Boris Johnson, the wrong sort of prime minister. Elected in December with the slogan of “Get Brexit Done”, he did not pay covid-19 enough attention. Ministers were chosen on ideological grounds; talented candidates with the wrong views were left out in the cold. Mr Johnson got the top job because he is a brilliant campaigner and a charismatic entertainer with whom the Conservative Party fell in love. Beating the coronavirus calls for attention to detail, consistency and implementation, but they are not his forte.

The pandemic has many lessons for the government, which the inevitable public inquiry will surely clarify. Here is one for voters: when choosing a person or party to vote for, do not underestimate the importance of ordinary, decent competence. ■||1
2020-06-18||The bank business model in the post-Covid-19 world

The Covid-19 pandemic has induced a deep global economic crisis. While so far banks have shown their resilience, partly thanks to major reforms after the crisis of 2007-2009, the crisis will put them under stress. Moreover, the traditional banking model was already being challenged pre-Covid by three trends: persistently low interest rates, enhanced regulation, and increased competition from shadow banks and digital entrants. This column introduces the second report in the Future of Banking series from the IESE Business School and CEPR, which provides a perspective on how the current crisis and these trends will shape the future of the banking sector.

The world is witnessing a large and synchronised economic crisis. Forecasts for 2020 suggest a drop in global GDP of 6% with a record number of countries growing at negative rates (OECD 2020). Advanced economies will suffer a much larger drop in GDP, of a size not seen since the Great Depression. No doubt, banks will come under stress as large-scale insolvencies among firms will arise and a wave of bankruptcies among households may follow. In addition, while banks entered the crisis better capitalised and more liquid, the size of the crisis will likely strain them to a degree exceeding that envisioned in many stress tests conducted so far (ECB 2020).

The crisis comes on top of the combination over the past decade of several trends that have meant increased competitive pressure on banks and that, in particular in some regions, have lowered their profitability. In the second report in CEPR/IESE series on The Future of Banking (Claessens et al. 2020), we argue that the global pandemic is likely to prolong, if not accelerate, many of these trends – digitalisation in particular. While the economic crisis has triggered policy responses to stimulate lending to the real economy while assuring the stability of the banking sector that provides breathing space in the short run, deep restructuring of many banking systems will be needed in the medium-term.

Download The Bank Business Model in the Post-Covid-19 World here.

We have now been living in a world of low interest rates and subdued growth rates for more than a decade. These persistently low rates have negatively affected bank profitability through reduced net interest margins and weakened monitoring incentives and lending standards, in particular for those institutions more reliant on maturity transformation and net interest income. In the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, we also witnessed over this period an increase in prudential requirements, regulatory scrutiny and compliance costs, as analysed in the first report in this series (Bolton et al. 2019). These policy steps have contributed to a more resilient banking sector, which is very beneficial in the current context. At the same time, however, the tighter rules have lessened banks’ competitiveness relative to shadow banks and added to a migration of some business activities away from the banking sector towards shadow banks. Moreover, stricter regulation has put pressure on banks’ profitability.

The Covid-19 crisis most likely means interest rates will remain low for much longer. Although in the short run banks are bound to benefit from being the channel of liquidity support and having access to central bank support, the deep crisis hitting the real economy is likely to bring a new surge in non-performing loans and could threaten banks’ solvency once again.

An additional development during the pre-Covid world was the massive application of digital technologies and the emergence of new competitors. While these have allowed for many new products and services and helped improve the efficiency of incumbent banks, they have also favoured the entry of new firms, increasing competition with traditional bank business models.

The impact of technology on bank business models has been profound (Vives 2019). Technological advances have affected payment systems, capital markets activities, credit extension and deposit collection. In the report, we analyse in detail the area where much activity is happening – namely, digital money and payments. For decades, banks have controlled digital forms of money and payments through regulatory protection of deposits, exclusive access to the central bank settlement system and close partnerships with credit card companies. The challenge today comes from a variety of digital assets that do not sit on the balance sheet of banks: cryptocurrencies, electronic wallets, stablecoins, or balances with a telecom provider. The competitive advantage of the new entrants is not based on the asset itself, but on the payment technology associated with it. The convenience of payments and the connections to other parts of the growing digital life of consumers and business alike, accelerated by the Covid crisis, has been the key to success. The dominance in payments of tech companies in China or mobile telecom providers in parts of Africa are examples of the extent of disruption.

Disruption from technology has happened in many other areas, not just payments. Entry in the different financial service segments has come from new types of providers: ‘FinTech’ and ‘BigTech’. FinTech providers of credit are more present when the country’s general development is higher and its banking system is less competitive, but less so when the country’s regulation is stricter. Non-bank entry is not yet meaningful in demand deposit-like taking activities, possible due to concerns about regulatory burdens. BigTech platforms, with their advanced technology and especially their (associated) greater access to (big) data, could make major inroads, but have not done so to date.

The entry of new players greatly affects banks through downward pressures on fees and prices and more compressed margins. Banks have responded, but many argue that they are far from adopting technology effectively themselves. As a result, their profitability comes further under threat.

The technological advances and new entry require regulatory responses. The technologies used by the new entrants can create new risks, including fresh consumer and investor protection issues, as the accumulating evidence on risk of discrimination associated with greater use of technology and big data shows. Since more entities now provide financial services and in new forms, it is also crucial to ensure a level playing field. A related important question is where to draw the regulatory ‘perimeter’, given that the overall industrial organisation of the various financial services markets is changing. The technology-induced changes also call for reassessments of competition and data policies.

In the short run, banks may enjoy a revitalisation as they continue lending to their customers during the crisis, notably as soft information can more valuable today than hard information. They also enjoy the protection of the safety net and access to deposit financing.

Nevertheless, Covid-19 will likely accelerate the digitalisation and the shift over the medium term of activities away from the sector. Medium-sized banks will likely be suffering the most since reaping cost efficiencies with large IT investments, crucial in a persistently low interest environment, will be out of reach. As a result, the banking sector will need deep restructuring; winding up banks and consolidating the remaining ones will be preferred. Whether in the post-Covid-19 world, political obstacles to cross-border mergers will prevent, as states become more protective of their national banking champions, is a major policy question.

BigTech companies have many of the ingredients to get ahead in the post-Covid world. They are digital natives; they have the technology, customer base and brand recognition, as well as vast amounts of data and deep pockets. Banking may thus move from the traditional oligopoly to a system with a few dominant platforms that control access to a fragmented customer base, with a few BigTech firms, together with some platform-transformed incumbents, monopolising the interface with customers. In this scenario, ensuring customer data ownership and portability for individuals, and data interoperability between platforms, will be key to keeping switching costs for customers low and the market sufficiently competitive.

Digital disruption poses a formidable challenge to regulators, which must adapt by balancing facilitating competition and allowing the benefits of innovation to pervade the system with protecting financial stability. In order to so, regulators must coordinate prudential regulation and competition policy so that compliance does not becomes a barrier to entry while at the same time entry does not becomes destabilising. Competition can be fostered by light regulation of the entrants, but at the potential cost of decreasing the profitability of incumbents and thus increasing their risk-taking incentives. In addition, this may mean the generation of systemic risks to non-bank entities.

The current crisis will test the resilience of the financial system and the regulatory reforms implemented after the global financial crisis of 2007-2009, which were examined in the first report from the Banking Initiative. In particular, it will stretch the limits of central bank intervention, and put to the test the incomplete Banking Union in the euro area.

2020-06-19||The Australian dollar drifted lower through trade on Thursday following a larger than anticipated up tick in unemployment and a consolidated shift in risk demand. The Australian dollar fell to 0.6843 after labour market data showed the unemployment rate jumped to 7.1%, as almost 230,000 jobs were lost in May, a print well beyond conservative estimates. Alarmingly the upturn in unemployment came despite a reduction in the participation rate. With many Australian’s giving up the search for re-employment, unemployment statistics fail to capture the true scale of labour market turmoil. Having fallen below 63% the dip in the participation rate masks a much higher rate of unemployment. Had active participation in the workforce remained at January’s high (66.1%) then unemployment would sit nearer 11.5%. With labour market conditions continuing to worsen, yesterday’s print offers a stark reminder of the economic costs sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic. Having touched intraday lows, the AUD found some support in the promise of easing Chinese Monetary policy. The PBOC announced a 20-basis point cut to its reverse repo rate in a bid to stimulate the flow of credit and drive the Chinese recovery. The AUD crept back toward 0.69 before a shift in risk demand prompted another downward correction and push to safe haven assets. With the number of new infections across the US continuing to rise at an alarming rate and Beijing still battling its own outbreak, there is real concern a second wave of infections will derail any economic rebound through the short/medium term. Having slipped back below 0.6850, the AUD opens this morning buying 0.6847 US cents.

A modest risk-off mood prompted a broader push to safe haven currencies overnight, propping up the USD, JPY and CHF. Concerns surrounding an alarming uptick in new infections across the US and a second outbreak in Beijing have prompted investors to reassess expectations surrounding the pace and path of economic recovery. Texas, Arizona and North Carolina all reported a record number of coronavirus related hospitalisations on Wednesday as case numbers across the country continue to rise amid lifting social distancing restrictions. The US dollar edged higher as growth correlated currencies fell.

The Great British pound was the day’s big loser, falling over 1% in the wake of the Bank of England’s policy announcement. The MPC elected to leave the cash rate at 0.1% while confirming an uptick of 100billion pounds to its current QE program. The increase takes the total purchase facility to 745bn and means the program will now run into the end of the year. While the move was largely expected, many analysts were pushing for a larger increase in the asset purchase program. With normal drivers flipped on their head and increased monetary easing/stimulus driving currency gains, the disappointment forced sterling below 1.2450 to intraday lows at 1.2406.

Attentions today remain squarely affixed to the broader risk narrative, with the risk on – risk off environment creating ongoing short term volatility.

2020-06-19||EA showed off a much longer look at Star Wars: Squadrons during its EA Play presentation, including our first look at gameplay. The dogfighting game looks to be a modernization of the classic X-Wing and TIE Fighter series. In an interview with GameSpot as part of our summer gaming celebration Play For All, creative director Ian Frazier suggested that inspiration runs deep, and shared more details on game balance and team composition.

For one thing, unlike the Rogue Squadron series, there is no option to switch to third-person view. You'll be engaging in all of your dogfights through the first-person cockpit view, in part for game balance. Frazier said that third-person would give players a competitive advantage over the limited field-of-view of first-person. But it goes a step further, to the point that you could turn off all the game HUD elements for full immersion.

"The whole game is designed from the ground up to be first-person all the way through," Frazier said. "Now if you're in spectator mode, you're observing, there's a third-person perspective there. You are the pilot. All the diegetic information is built into the hud, so you could turn off all the game layer UI if you want and rely entirely on your instruments. We want that to be the core experience."

That decision inevitably leads to a disparity in the types of craft. Star Wars fans know that X-Wing pilots occupy a clear wraparound cockpit window with a wide field of view, while TIE pilots have only a small circular window and two wide paneled wings that would block vision anyway. This, paired with the lack of shields on a TIE, would appear to give the New Republic ships a clear competitive advantage.

But Frazier says it's not that simple, and for the reason why he went back to the Lucasarts X-Wing and TIE Fighter games. He said when researching for the game, he looked at old competitive forums where players would ask how the TIE isn't strictly worse than the X-Wing.

"The answer then, in 1997, was you have a lot less stuff to deal with in an Imperial ship. And that is, in a sense, an advantage. I've actually found that to be shockingly true in our game," he said. "The TIE Fighter doesn't have shields--which, you don't have shields, which is a downside, right? But that also means you don't have to manage shields. It's one less thing to manage, so there's less head-space required for that. … The counterbalance of what you're losing is what you're gaining in focus."

As for how those head-to-head fights play out functionally, he also said that the studio has put some time into giving players more options. In a dogfighting game, it's easy to get caught in what he calls the "death loop," where each ship is chasing each other until one of them gets shot down. To give more strategic improvisation, Squadrons lets you shift power to three core systems: lasers, engines, and shields. If you max out your engines you get to use a boost, and you can further iterate on that by doing a drift--cutting your engines to turn and then suddenly boosting, for more evasive maneuvers.

Finally, Frazier touched on how team composition and planning your loadouts can help complement each other for advanced strategies.

"It's not one person against the world, it's always a team of five," he said. "Everything is built against that idea of a tight-knit squadron. In PvP it's not just what loadout are you taking, but what are your buddies taking? How can you get synergies between those things? So, okay, I've got the tractor beam that's going to hold them in place for a couple of seconds, she's got the Goliath missile that can kick the crap out of them but it doesn't track very well, and those two things in combination are really dangerous."

2020-06-19||Winning a mandate from their members to go into government is just the first hurdle facing the leaders of the three potential coalition parties. They will each have to raise their game by a considerable measure to have any chance of surviving the inevitable storms ahead.

Leo Varadkar had the bonus of being able to bask in the spectacularly good approval ratings revealed in the latest Irish Times/Ipsos MRBI poll, just as the coalition deal was being announced, but that raises the question as to why Fine Gael did so badly in the general election.

“I’m pleased for Leo that he is getting public recognition for his leadership in the Covid crisis but I’m angry that he has only shown his true abilities after the horse has bolted,” said one senior Fine Gael figure. “He picked the wrong date for the election, the preparations were appalling and the campaign was a disaster.”

By contrast, his handling of the Covid crisis was sure-footed and might even be described as inspiring. Once the seriousness of the threat became apparent he took decisive action and, more importantly, communicated the scale of the threat to the public and generated a mood of solidarity that was vital to make the lockdown successful.

That mood was summed up in a child’s poem about the lockdown read out on Lyric FM a few weeks ago which contained the lines: “And thank God we have Leo, not Boris or Trump”.

The question facing Varadkar now is how, back in government as tánaiste, he will be able to contribute to a similar level of public support for the difficult process of exiting the lockdown and coping with the cost.

Another if less important question is whether, in his new role as tánaiste, he will be able to sustain anything like the level of support shown for Fine Gael in the poll or whether in government the party will slide back to the dismal rating it achieved in the general election.

For Micheál Martin the conundrum is the opposite. He will finally achieve his ambition of becoming taoiseach but at a time when his party is sinking in the polls and the man he is replacing has managed to generate a record level of public trust. Establishing his authority as taoiseach will be his first priority and that will not be easy given the scale of the task ahead.

Martin will have to demonstrate leadership skills in office as that will be crucial to rebuilding the image of Fianna Fáil as a competent party of government. Maintaining a distinctive image will be a challenge but, after nine years in opposition, a spell in government offers the best opportunity to do that.

In the past Fianna Fáil’s great strength was its ability to bring people along with it while it was in government. That gave it the platform to win re-election on a regular basis. It is a political skill that always eluded Fine Gael and it will be a vital ingredient in making the three-party coalition a success.

For Eamon Ryan, the process of attempting to bring his party into government has been a daunting experience. After the February election it was widely assumed that, having led his party to a record 12 Dáil seats, he would be in a strong position to set its future direction.

Instead, as often happens in politics, great success can be every bit as dangerous as failure for a leader. Ryan has had to move very carefully in an effort to bring most of his new TDs with him along the path to government.

Some of them are clearly not enamoured with his leadership and regard him as every much part of the establishment as Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.

As if that wasn’t enough, he is also facing a leadership challenge from his deputy Catherine Martin and there is no guarantee that even if the members vote to go into coalition he will remain as leader. All of that adds a huge element of instability to the potential government and Ryan will have his work cut out to maintain control even if he survives the leadership challenge.

The ability of the coalition to govern effectively will depend on a high level of trust between the three party leaders. If Ryan is removed from the leadership it is difficult to see how cohesion will be maintained in the face of the difficult decisions ahead. Still, the likelihood must be that if a majority of Green party members endorse going into coalition they will stick by the leader who has brought them there.

As far as implementing a Green agenda goes, there was never a better time for the party to be in power. They have extracted serious commitments from the other two parties on climate change while the current moves by the EU to implement a green deal mean that there is an effective guarantee they will get a lot of their priorities implemented.

As they weigh up their options, Green members could do worse than ponder the wise saying of Indian Nobel literature prize winner Rabindranath Tagore. “You can’t cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water”.||1
2020-06-19||The stock market and the economy: Insights from the COVID-19 crisis

During the COVID-19 pandemic and the related economic fallout, the response of the stock markets has raised concerns as well as questions. This column explores the surprising trends. There is some evidence that shareholders have favoured the less vulnerable firms, and that credit facilities and government guarantees, lower policy interest rates, and lockdown measures mitigated the decline in stock prices. However, fundamentals only explain a small part of the stock market variations at the country level. Overall, it is hard to deny that the links between stock prices and fundamentals have been loose at best.

On 08 June 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the COVID-19 pandemic was worsening around the globe and warned against complacency: “most people globally are still susceptible to infection. (...) More than six months into this pandemic, this is not the time for any country to take its foot off the pedal”. On the very same day, the US stock market began its fourth consecutive week of rally. The S&P 500 index is back to where it was at the beginning of 2020, erasing the historic plunge (one-third of its value) that took place between 20 February and 23 March 2020, as if nothing had ever happened. This is simply unprecedented, as illustrated in the figure below.

Figure 1 The US stock market in the time of COVID-19

Note: This figure compares the drop of the S&P 500 index during the dot-com crisis (which peaked on March 24, 2000), the subprime crisis (peaked on Oct. 9, 2007) and the COVID-19 crisis (peaked on Feb. 19, 2020). In March 2020, it took only one month for the S&P 500 to lose one-third of its value, while it took one year for the subprime crisis to decline the same amount, and one year and half for the dotcom bust. Authors’ computation.

Is anything strange about the stock market behaviour in the time of COVID-19? As the world suffered from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression (Baldwin and Weder di Mauro 2020a, 2020b, Bénassy-Quéré and Weder di Mauro 2020, Coibon et al. 2020), the reaction of stock markets raises serious concerns. Since the beginning of the crisis, stock prices seem to be running wild. They first ignored the pandemic, then panicked when Europe became its epicentre. Now, they are behaving as if the millions of people infected, the 400,000 deaths, and the containment of half the world’s population will have no economic impact after all.

In one of his influential New York Times columns, Paul Krugman (2020) said out loud what many people were thinking: “Whenever you consider the economic implications of stock prices, you want to remember three rules. First, the stock market is not the economy. Second, the stock market is not the economy. Third, the stock market is not the economy (…). The relationship between stock performance – largely driven by the oscillation between greed and fear – and real economic growth has always been somewhere between loose and nonexistent”. The no less famous Malkiel and Shiller (2020) have also discussed the seemingly odd behaviour of stock markets in the face of the pandemic. According to Malkiel, the alleged stock market irrationality is only “apparent”, and the COVID-19 crisis does not “impl[y] that markets are inefficient” inasmuch as there are no arbitrage opportunities, and stock markets remain hard to beat. Shiller is more nuanced: “Speculative prices may indeed statistically resemble a random walk, but they are not so tied to genuine information (…). The contagious stories about the coronavirus had their own internal dynamics only loosely related to the information about the actual truth”.

What new insights on stock markets behaviour can be drawn from the COVID-19 crisis? This debate is of special importance for financial economists, but also because the general public has a very negative view of the stock markets, which should not leave us unconcerned (Rajan 2015) – all the more so since the COVID-19 crisis put science and ‘experts’ to the test (Aksoy et al. 2020), without sparing economists.

There is a fast-growing body of research looking at the responses of stock markets to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is already giving some insights. While the dynamic of stock markets during the pandemic might look random, irrational, or even insane at first glance, on closer inspection they did not react blindly. Several studies have shown that stock markets were effective in discounting the most exposed companies: those who were more financially fragile, subject to the disruption of international value chains, vulnerable in terms of corporate social responsibility, or less resilient to social distancing (Alburque et al. 2020, Ding et al. 2020, Fahlenbrach et al. 2020, Pagano et al. 2020, Ramelli and Wagner 2020). Moreover, it seems that stock market losses are related to analyst forecast revisions, at least in the medium term (Landier and Thesmar 2020). In relation to these papers, we take a macroeconomic perspective. Indeed, the above-mentioned studies provide valuable information, but some questions remain open.

How have stock markets reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic? How do we explain differences in responses between countries? Are these differences in stock market response across countries related to macroeconomic or institutional characteristics, and if so, which ones? Are these differences due to the way governments have handled the pandemic? How have stock markets have reacted to lockdowns and economic policies implemented countrywide to ‘flatten’ the curve of infection and the curve of recession? (Gourinchas 2020)

In our recent paper (Capelle-Blancard and Desroziers 2020), we assess how stock markets have integrated public information about the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns. Although the COVID-19 shock has been global, not all countries have been impacted in the same way, and they have not reacted in the same way. We take advantage of this strong heterogeneity. We aim to explain the difference in stock markets response by the situation in each country before the crisis, as well as subsequent containment measures (social distancing and stay-at-home orders) and economic policies (fiscal and monetary) implemented during the crisis. We consider a panel of 74 countries from January to April 2020, which might be divided into four phases: Incubation, Outbreak, Fear, and Rebound. For each country, we collected daily data about stock index prices, the number of COVID-19 cumulative cases and deaths, global market sentiment and volatility, government measures taken in response to the outbreak, and various indicators of mobility (or lack thereof).

Three main findings about stock market reactions during the COVID-19 pandemic arise. First, after initially ignoring the pandemic (until 21 February 2020), stock markets reacted strongly to the increase in the number of infected people in each country (23 February to 20 March 2020), while volatility surged as concerns about the pandemic grew. However. following the intervention of central banks (23 March to 20 April 2020), shareholders no longer seemed troubled by news of the health crisis, and prices rebounded all around the world. Second, country-specific characteristics appear to have had, at best, little influence on stock market responses. Stock markets did not react more strongly in countries more susceptible to the pandemic, either due to structural economic fragility (for instance, indebted countries), or through exposure to transmission vectors (for instance, countries with ‘at-risk’ populations). Third, investors were sensitive to the number of COVID-19 cases in neighbouring (but mostly wealthy) countries. Fourth, credit facilities and government guarantees, lower policy interest rates, and lockdown measures mitigated the decline in stock prices.

In conclusion, do stock markets incorporate all available information? Actually, it transpires that we can see the glass as half-full or half-empty. On the one hand, the dynamic of stock markets during the COVID-19 pandemic is not completely accidental. In particular, our study suggests that it was not the situation of countries before the crisis that influenced the reaction of stock markets, but rather the health policies implemented during the crisis to limit the transmission of the virus and the macroeconomic policies aiming to support companies. On the other hand, fundamentals only explain a (very) small part of the stock market variations. Just like Krugman and Shiller have claimed, it is hard to deny that the link between stock prices and fundamentals have been anything other than loose.

2020-06-19||My seven-year-old triplets — two girls and a boy — were having trouble doing classwork at home. The coronavirus pandemic meant that they did not have access to a classroom, with desks to sit down at. It is hard to study at the dining-room table with your siblings (their school, sensibly, tries to put them in separate classrooms so that they don’t distract each other) as dad gives the baby a bottle and e-mails his students. This was something we all had to get used to.

A more upsetting issue was my children’s anxiety concerning the virus and social distancing. This anxiety became clear when I returned from grocery-shopping one day to find one of my daughters crying uncontrollably because she was afraid I would not make it back alive. My other daughter had nightmares that my wife, a health-care worker, would get COVID-19 and give it to the baby. My son was afraid that we would run out of food and starve.

I was able to find a solution that helped with working and schooling from home. Taking a cue from a local science museum’s space-station simulator, we turned our guest bedroom into a spaceship-themed classroom. We decorated it to resemble the International Space Station and USS Enterprise. Each child had their own computer station on the ‘bridge’, and I had a standing workstation. We were able to embark on a learning experience using our imaginations.

However, the triplets’ anxiety endured. My son cried when, after the closure of schools, parks, museums and the library, he found out that the arcade at our local shopping mall was closed, too. I told my children that experts were telling everyone to engage in social distancing, and I showed them the COVID-19 prevention guidelines issued by the chief medical officer of the US Coast Guard. Rear admiral Dana Thomas is a highly qualified physician, and the consensus of the triplets was that we should therefore listen to her. I told my children about a paper I had published, about how expert opinion influences people’s attitudes towards climate change. We decided that we would do our own study about who people trust for information about COVID-19 prevention.

Although the study would be small, rushed and nowhere near the quality threshold for peer review, I saw it as an opportunity to teach my children about the scientific method, and to address their coronavirus anxiety head-on. We devised an experiment in which people would hear messages from four sources about preventing the spread of COVID-19. We decided that the sources would be a group of health-care workers, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, social media and a fictitious politician. For an educator such as myself, explaining the experimental set-up to seven-year-olds after years of teaching undergraduates was an eye-opening experience.

We collected data through an online survey. When it came to data analysis, I showed the triplets how the pictures used in their mathematics workbook from school are similar to charts and figures that are used in research. This provided a breakthrough in their understanding of some mathematical concepts. Then we used the data to work on representing groups of numbers such as tens and ones to look at in our sample. This helped my children to form a more concrete idea of large numbers, and made working on mathematics with them more enjoyable and less of an arduous task.

My children were not fond of having to sit down and do writing assignments, so I told them that even daddy has to do these. I wrote up our results as a paper that conformed to American Psychological Association style, and showed it to them. This made the kids more open to working on writing tasks.

Aside from the education they received at home, my children now show less anxiety about COVID-19, but they are still sad at missing friends. Although social distancing and working from home can derail many plans, it can also be an excellent opportunity to share your passion for science with your children. Turning my kids’ anxiety into curiosity was one of the most rewarding experiences I have had as a scientist. During this difficult time, we may have the opportunity to connect with our children in ways that inspire the next generation of scientists. And my triplets already have an idea for our next experiment.

Coronavirus and COVID-19: Keep up to date||1
2020-06-19||Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be speaking with you today.

Let me start by saying that never before in Europe have we seen such a level of interest about hydrogen as we have today. The reason is twofold: we need hydrogen to achieve climate-neutrality and we should use this opportunity to invest in the clean energy technologies, to restart the economy and promote innovation after the devastating economic effects of the COVID crisis.

This new Commission took office last December and since the beginning we have set our sights on a very clear goal – a climate neutral Europe within thirty years. This is the corner stone of our Green Deal strategy.

The first half of this year has definitely not gone to plan as we found ourselves combating the biggest health crisis in living memory.

Still, we are turning adversity into opportunity. We have published a Recovery Plan for Europe - the Next Generation EU - putting the green transformation at its heart. In this way, the Green Deal and the clean energy transition act as a new growth strategy. One that creates new investments and jobs for our people. One example is wind energy: over the last decade the cost of electricity generated by offshore wind fell by almost 30% and it is becoming more and more competitive compared to fossil fuel sources.

Our power sector is decarbonising rapidly and by 2030 almost 76% will come from low-carbon sources renewables (54.8%) and nuclear (21.1%). By 2050, our electricity supply is expected to be fully decarbonised with over 80% coming from renewables.

But electricity alone cannot get us there. We know that we will also need other carriers.

We also know that to keep energy costs in check, we must harness all the synergies and exploit the complementarities between the electricity sector, our vast gas infrastructure, our industry and the transport sector.

Hydrogen is a vital missing piece of the puzzle to help us reach this deeper decarbonisation and to reach it at a lower cost to people.

We have recognised this opportunity and are working on two key strategies to be launched on the 8th of July: a strategy for energy system integration and a dedicated strategy on hydrogen. They will set out how we intend to accelerate the transition to the energy system of the future. A system in which hydrogen will play a key role.

Today, we use hydrogen mostly in chemical processes. Tomorrow, hydrogen can decarbonise these industrial processes, it can be a new fuel for heavy-duty transport and clean jet fuel for aviation, or replace coal in steel-making.

To make this happen we need to focus our work in four areas.

First, we need to activate a virtuous circle of increased supply and demand for hydrogen, boosting demand in end uses, like industrial applications and transport, and investing in developing electrolysers with greater capacity. Part of this is bringing down the cost of clean hydrogen to make it competitive. For this, we need more and cheaper renewable energy, and an efficient electricity market.

We have laid the ground for this through the Clean Energy for all Europeans market design legislation which we are currently implementing.

But we will go even further to create an ecosystem approach to hydrogen production. To do this, we are creating a Clean Hydrogen Alliance to bring the full value chain of hydrogen together: investors, governmental, institutional and industrial partners. This template of an industrial alliance has proven its worth before in Europe. We aim to involve all actors upstream and downstream to accelerate hydrogen deployment and achieve cost reductions and greater competitiveness.

Second, we need a regulatory framework to shape an open and competitive market with unhindered cross border trade and infrastructures to transport hydrogen where it is needed. This could mean a need to repurpose or re-use some of our existing natural gas infrastructure and helps us to avoid stranded assets.

Third, we need to continue our research and innovation. Because developing a clean hydrogen economy poses a technological challenge.

We need to vastly scale up electrolyser technologies to support the ambition. But at this point, we still do not have the production capacity we need.

Demonstration projects are starting at 20 Mega Watts in Europe. But we need Giga Watt scale electrolysers. We also need research in fuel cells and storage. So in September we will adopt a Green Deal call of 950 million EUR under Horizon 2020, which will also cover hydrogen. Of that, more than one third will be dedicated to energy topics, including a call for a large-scale electrolyser. It is our hope that these will help us to gather the right minds and unleash their research and innovation in all the relevant areas across the hydrogen value chain.

And finally, we need international cooperation. The EU imports today just over 58% of the energy it needs. Tomorrow, we need to transform these imports of fossil fuels into clean energy partnerships. We want to work with our neighbours in the first place, but also with global partners. We need common understanding and possibly even the harmonisation of codes and standards for trading hydrogen internationally

I have seen our focus on hydrogen mirrored across the globe. The number of countries joining the International Hydrogen Council has more than quadrupled in the past three years.

And Director-General Matsuyama, I have seen that Japan has announced the next Olympic Games to be the “Hydrogen Olympics”. This is excellent!

Working side by side with our international partners is also a fundamental part of the research and innovation I mentioned earlier. This is why we are taking part in all major initiatives related to hydrogen, such as co-leading the Hydrogen Initiative of the Clean Energy Ministerial supported by the IEA. We are also involved in designing activities on hydrogen under Mission Innovation.

This is how we see the way forward – a strong approach on both an EU and an international level. This is how we scale up, exchange ideas and solidify the position of hydrogen in the energy sector.

I look forward to hearing your own views on hydrogen’s role in the energy system of tomorrow. And more about where we can work together further to shape that future.||2

2020-06-19||Objective no. 1: To define the risk of thrombosis in patients with COVID-19

All COVID-19 patients should be screened for additional thromboembolic risk factors, especially active cancer (treatment within the last 6 months) and recent personal history (< 1 years) of thromboembolic events.

Other risk factors may be considered (age > 70 years, prolonged bed rest, postpartum, combined oral contraception).

To define the thrombotic risk level according to the following:

- The severity of COVID-19 according to the requirement of supplemental oxygen (O ) therapy, high-flow nasal oxygen therapy, positive airway pressure support, or mechanical ventilation.

Then, 4 different levels of thromboembolic risk can be determined: low, intermediate, high, and very high (Table 1).

It is suggested that the following hemostasis variables be monitored at least every 48 h: platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen, and D-dimer levels.

In severe cases, in the event of clinical worsening, thrombocytopenia and/or a decrease in fibrinogen concentration, it is proposed that the concentration of fibrin monomers (if assay available), factors II and V, and antithrombin levels should also be measured for the diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

It is proposed that the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies should be investigated for iterative thrombosis under heparin therapy at effective doses.

In all hospitalized patients, it is proposed to switch from oral anticoagulant therapy, vitamin K antagonist or direct oral anticoagulant (risk of instability and drug interactions), to curative heparin therapy.

In case of intermediate thrombotic risk (Fig. 1), it is proposed to prescribe prophylaxis with a LMWH at standard doses, e.g., enoxaparin 4000 IU/24 h SC, tinzaparin 3500 IU/24 h SC, or dalteparin 5000 IU/24 h SC. Fondaparinux 2.5 mg/24 h SC is an alternative if creatinine clearance (Clcr) is greater than 50 ml/min. In the presence of severe renal failure, an alternative to SC unfractionated heparin (UFH) can be proposed: enoxaparin 2000 IU/24 h SC for a Clcr between 15 and 30 ml/min or tinzaparin 3500 IU/24 h SC for a Clcr between 20 and 30 ml/min.

In patients treated with LMWH with standard prophylactic doses, it is recommended NOT to monitor anti-Xa activity.

In case of high thrombotic risk, it is proposed to prescribe an adjusted prophylaxis with intermediate doses of LMWH: enoxaparin 4000 IU/12 h SC or 6000 IU/12 h SC if weight > 120 kg. In case of renal insufficiency (Clcr < 30 ml/min), it is proposed to prescribe UFH at an initial dose of 200 IU/kg/24 h, IV.

In patients treated with LMWH doses higher than the standard prophylactic regimen, it is proposed to check anti-Xa activity 4 h after the 3rd injection, then regularly in case of renal insufficiency, to monitor for levels (variable threshold value according to LMWH) due to the potential increased risk of bleeding.

In case of very high thrombotic risk, it is proposed to prescribe therapeutic doses of LMWH, e.g., enoxaparin, 100 IU/kg/12 h SC, or in case of severe renal insufficiency of UFH, 500 IU/Kg/24 h, IV after a bolus of 5000 IU, and with dosage adjustment according to anti-Xa activity.

In obese patients (BMI > 30 kg/m2) with a high or very high thrombotic risk, the following heparin doses are proposed:
• None Enoxaparin 4000 IU/12 h or 6000 IU/12 h if weight > 120 kg in high-risk patients
• None Enoxaparin 100 IU/kg (actual weight)/12 h SC not to exceed 10,000 IU/12 h or UFH 500 IU/kg/24 h in very high-risk patients with additional thrombotic risk factor and high-flow nasal O therapy or artificial ventilation

In all patients treated with UFH, it is proposed to monitor the anti-Xa activity at least every 48 h and after each dose modification, to be maintained, if the risk of bleeding is controlled, between 0.3 and 0.5 IU/ml during reinforced prophylactic treatment (starting dose 200 IU/kg/24 h, IV) and between 0.5 and 0.7 IU/ml during therapeutic treatment (starting dose 500 IU/kg/24 h, IV, after an initial IV bolus of 5000 IU).

The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) exposes the patient to a very high risk of thrombosis. In this setting, we propose therapeutic anticoagulation with UFH as soon as ECMO is initiated (independently of the ECMO flow rate), with a target anti-Xa level between 0.5 and 0.7 IU/ml.

In case of an increased inflammatory syndrome (e.g., fibrinogen > 8 g/l or 800 mg/dl) and/or a rapid increase in D-dimer concentration to > 3 μg/ml (3000 ng/ml), it is suggested that the administration of therapeutic doses of heparin be considered even in the absence of clinical thrombosis, taking into account the risk of hemorrhage.

For UFH, it is recommended that platelet count should be monitored at least every 48 h. A decrease in the platelet count by more than 40% between the 4th and 14th day of treatment requires a DIC assessment and a screening for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

In the event of multiorgan failure, or a consumptive coagulopathy with decrease in fibrinogen concentration, platelet count, and factor V level, it is proposed that the dosage of heparin therapy be reassessed, as these events are associated with an increased risk of bleeding.

It is proposed that the intensity and duration of thromboprophylaxis be re-evaluated according to the severity of the infection and the evolution of the resulting risk factors.

Objective no. 4: Apply additional measures for optimal management of thrombotic risk

Discontinuation of hormonal or hormone-related therapy (estrogen-progestin contraception, hormone replacement therapy, tamoxifen) is recommended in patients with COVID-19 requiring thromboprophylaxis.

It is proposed to implement a specific communication pathway between the clinical units and the hemostasis laboratory, for optimal transmission of biological results (in particular, platelet count, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and anti-Xa activity) for rapid adaptation of heparin therapy.

It is suggested that pulmonary embolism be investigated in any patient with sudden respiratory or hemodynamic deterioration, especially in the case of right ventricular dysfunction.

A proximal vein compression ultrasonography with Doppler of the common femoral and popliteal veins is proposed in the event of any unexplained clinical worsening, or in the case of a sudden increase in D-dimer levels.

This examination may also be performed earlier in patients with a central venous catheter, especially in case of dysfunction or obstruction.

The insertion of a vena cava filter is not warranted in these patients at low risk for bleeding.

Intermittent pneumatic compression is an option to be considered if available in patients at a high risk of bleeding.||0

2020-06-19||Warren Gatland has made a last plea to Premiership Rugby to reschedule its final next season as part of the global calendar negotiations to give the British and Irish Lions adequate preparation time ahead of their tour of South Africa.

Next year's Premiership final is scheduled for June 26, just seven days before the Lions' first fixture, against the Western Stormers in Cape Town.

Chiefs coach Gatland, who will take charge of his third Lions tour, has revealed that a similar lack of preparation time ahead of the tour to New Zealand in 2017 led to him raising concerns with the management about the risk of legal action if a player was injured as a consequence.

With talks continuing between the unions and clubs over proposals to restructure the global season, which could mean the Lions tour switching from July to September, and club rugby played through the summer months, Gatland insisted all parties had a duty to deliver on a commitment to improve player welfare.

 * Warren Gatland appointed British and Irish Lions head coach for South Africa in 2021



"It has been a little bit frustrating with the Premiership not moving their final," Gatland said. "That may change with the reintroduction of the season. We will have to wait and see. The ideal situation would have been to have a full week together in the UK, play a warm-up game and get on the plane the following day and head to South Africa.

"I don't think assembling a squad for two weeks before you play your first game in South Africa is too much of an unreasonable request. Last time, in New Zealand, we left on the Monday, had two days' travel and arrived on the Wednesday.

''The players were jet-lagged and had to play the first game on the Saturday. I did point that out to the powers-that-be and the Lions and said we were potentially opening ourselves up [to legal action]. I said if a player got a career-ending injury in the first game, I think he had potentially got a legitimate claim to say that the preparation wasn't adequate or he didn't have enough time from arriving in New Zealand before he was made to play his first game.

"Those are things we have got to be careful about. Everyone talks about player welfare, and it is one of the criteria in looking at seasons and planning and preparation. We have got to deliver that."

Gatland is urging the Premiership to reconsider and bring its final forward by a week, as the Pro14 has already committed to, and -insists the clubs would benefit directly from giving the Lions the best chance of success.

"The Pro14 did it and I wasn't quite sure why the Premiership weren't prepared to do the same," he added. "I am not sure why there doesn't seem to be the appetite to be really positive and try to work together in terms of helping the Lions.

"If the players go away on the Lions and win a series, it creates so much -interest from new supporters who probably don't follow clubs. You have got this -potential to create superstars as household names and legends. To me, if that happens to a club, you can use that and promote that and it benefits everyone. I would like to see a little bit more cooperation but that is something we are continually battling with and I will keep banging away."

Gatland insists the Lions, too, are prepared to be flexible on the scheduling of their tour if switching it to a September start is key to reaching agreement on the global calendar talks, which centre on moving the July test window to October.

"Probably the ideal scenario for us is that we would like to stay in the time-frame where it is at the moment, but if it means having to move -because it is a positive for everyone, I think we are prepared to do that," Gatland added.

"There is no doubt the southern hemisphere recognises how important the Lions tour is to their calendar every four years, it creates a lot of stimulus financially not only for the home -unions but also the host country and creates a huge amount of interest from the fans."

The uncertainty in the scheduling is proving a challenge in his plans for the tour. A recce trip to South Africa next month has been postponed, while recruitment of his backroom staff and coaching team has been put on hold because of the Covid-19 lockdown.

As head coach of the Chiefs, Gatland is due to return to the UK at the end of August, following the end of the -Super Rugby campaign.

He says he intends to speak to the chief executives of the four home -unions ahead of appointing his staff to -ensure that there is no repeat of his frustrations four years ago, when several candidates became unavailable, including the current Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend.

"I have some approaches from individuals and from agents about people, as I did last time," he added.

"I was interested in a few people, had spoken to one or two and then for whatever reason, people then became unavailable. It was a bit frustrating. The important thing now is that I have changed the process. I want to get around all the chief -executives of the four home unions and talk to them. I will ask which of their staff are potentially not available so that we don't end up with that same situation going forward.

"I have found working with the Lions incredibly stimulating and there is no doubt that I think that all the four nations have benefited incredibly from the tours. Everyone takes the best out of the tour back to their home nation and club and implements the things that have been successful, as a player or coach."

Having first worked as an assistant coach under Sir Ian McGeechan on the tour of South Africa in 2009, Gatland's passion for the Lions is a central theme of his autobiography Pride and Passion, which has been shortlisted for the Rugby Book of the Year at the Telegraph Sports Book Awards.

Having guided the tourists to victory in Australia in 2013, and a historic drawn series against New Zealand four years later, Gatland has already secured his place in Lions folklore. Next year offers him the chance to complete what is likely to be his last tour in charge unbeaten against the southern hemisphere "big three".

"The dream is to be undefeated in the Test series in three tours as head coach," he added. "Going forward it is probably an opportunity for someone else to step up and take the mantle. If I can be of any service, in terms of helping the Lions, in terms of sharing experiences, I would love to follow them again.

"I still have a huge passion for it and am very fortunate for my experiences I have had. I have done my time. But it is like anything, they might come and knock on my door and say 'We don't think anyone else has got the experience and would you do it again?'

"Then you reassess everything but they would probably say I have been in charge for three tours, is it right for someone else to have a go. I am comfortable with that."||1
2020-06-20||Despite the growing importance of services in output and trade, there has been relatively little information on how services policies have evolved over the past decades. This column presents evidence on services trade policies from a new database created by the World Bank and WTO. It reveals that higher income economies are more open on average than developing economies, but the chronology of reform varies across sectors. In addition, while explicit restrictions are being lowered, regulatory scrutiny is increasing in most sectors, especially in higher income economies.

Economic policy has changed dramatically since the Great Recession. The post-WWII liberalising trend in goods trade is being reversed and multilateral cooperation is ceding ground to a more nationalistic view of policy (World Bank 2020). At the same time, technological change is accelerating, especially in response to the COVID-19 shock. In this changing environment, it has been possible to closely track goods trade policies, but there is much less information on how services policies have evolved despite the growing importance of services in output and trade (WTO 2019).

This gap in information matters because services are intimately linked to developments over the last decade. For instance, the Great Recession originated in financial markets where regulation failed to keep step with liberalisation (Rajan 2010); the emergence of new digital platforms is transforming business, retail, communication, transport, and financial services; and the improvements in information and communication technology could be ushering in a new era of cross-border trade in services (Baldwin 2019). Are governments reacting to these developments proactively through radical reform, defensively by imposing new restrictions, or inertially by doing nothing?

To answer this question and to facilitate the empirical analysis of policy change, the World Bank and the WTO engaged in a major policy data collection and quantification exercise, which resulted in a new World Bank-WTO Services Trade Policy Database (STPD). This database contains information on the services trade policies in five broad areas – financial, telecommunication, distribution, transportation, and professional services. The STPD contains information not just on core trade policies but also on other increasingly relevant regulatory measures such as licensing conditions and restrictions on cross-border data flows.

Policy restrictiveness is quantified following an improved Services Trade Restrictions Index (STRI) that aggregates the qualitative information within a single consistent and transparent measure. Data previously collected by the World Bank over 2008-2011 were adjusted to the new classification and quantified based on the updated STRI methodology. The harmonised data make it possible for the first time to compare services trade policies over a long period of time – between 2008 and 2016 – for a large cross-section of 55 advanced and developing economies.

On the basis of that information, it is possible to identify patterns of services trade policies across economies and sectors as well as secular trends in policy making over the past decade. On the face of it, services trade regimes are generally becoming more open, at least as far as explicit restrictions are concerned, in apparent contrast to recent changes in goods trade policy. Most recently, however, services trade policy is also becoming more restrictive, especially in digitally traded computer and audio-visual services (OECD 2020). Tightening measures in 2019 mostly affected foreign investment and the movement of people.

This most recent turn of events notwithstanding, higher income economies are still more open on average than lower income economies in most sectors. The decrease in policy restrictiveness since 2008, i.e. over nearly a decade, is slightly more pronounced for high-income economies (Figure 1). At the same time, some dynamic developing economies such as Bangladesh, India, and China have also liberalised significantly in the past decade. Other lower-income and middle-income economies that have liberalised their services trade policies appreciably (by at least five points on average) are Ecuador, Uruguay, Indonesia, Tunisia, Thailand, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Pakistan. Underlying these patterns of overall liberalisation across economies are differences in the sectoral pattern of liberalisation. We illustrate these below by focusing on two sectors: financial services (especially commercial banking) and professional services (auditing).

Figure 1 Services trade policy has become more open since the Great Recession (Changes in STRI between 2008-2011 and 2016 by level of income)

All sectors have been liberalized but by varying degrees. Broad waves in services policy reform can be identified. Higher income economies have led the way, pioneering the opening up of telecommunications and finance to foreign competition in the 1980s and 1990s. Hence, the picture already emerging a decade ago in these two sectors was of general openness in higher income economies, and of varying degrees of liberalisation in developing economies. The new database reveals that since 2008 developing economies have started to reform those sectors that were first liberalised by higher income economies, while the latter have embarked on the liberalisation of other sectors, notably professional and transport services. Hence, the picture emerging more recently is of policy convergence in telecommunications and finance driven by liberalisation by hitherto more restrictive developing economies, and divergence and dispersion in sectors such as professional and transport services.

There are particularly striking examples of recent reforms in financial services in some of the most dynamic developing countries such as Bangladesh, Kenya, the Philippines or Vietnam (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Limited convergence in financial services trade openness (Changes in STRI between 2008-2011 and 2016 by level of income)

Digging deeper into the policy data on commercial banking services reveals certain patterns. A large majority of economies now allow entry into their markets through the acquisition and control of domestic entities, through the establishment of wholly owned subsidiaries, or through direct branching. The preferred avenue is the acquisition of already licensed institutions, which may be explained by the host regulators' wish to recapitalise local banks (notably after the 2008-2009 financial crisis) while maintaining the existing market structure and therefore the current intensity of competition. Both fully owned subsidiaries and direct branches have been increasingly allowed in most economies, but the former remains a preferred option for local regulators, given the potential for risk transmission that foreign bank branches present, as was evident in the financial crisis. Interestingly, no economy in our sample abrogated access through branching – the increased share of governments allowing this form of entry is the result therefore of additional liberalisation in emerging economies (e.g. Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, Philippines, Russian Federation).

Even though there are now fewer explicit restrictions on entry, scrutiny of foreign banks has remained intense or even been strengthened. For instance, even when the presence through branching is allowed, stringent regulatory conditions (e.g. imposition of endowment capital requirements, limitations on the expansion of the branching network) are imposed in a majority of economies. In addition, roughly a quarter of our sample now applies different licensing criteria for foreign banks. Finally, more than half of the economies in our sample subject foreign banks to either economic needs tests, investment screening requirements or non-automatic licensing approvals (even when all formal licensing criteria have been fulfilled).

Figure 3 Divergence in auditing services trade openness (Changes in STRI between 2008-2011 and 2016 by level of income)

Policy dispersion is still the norm in sectors that joined the liberalisation wave more recently and in a more limited number of economies. In auditing, most of the decrease in the STRI is linked to less restrictive policies regarding the entry of professionals in high-income and middle-income economies, as well as the loosening of restrictions for cross-border supply for high-income economies. Restrictions on commercial presence were reduced only slightly, with highly restrictive economies remaining so in 2016 (India, Korea, Panama, the Philippines, Turkey).

The high-income economies presenting the biggest reductions in restrictiveness are Japan and some EU members, where reforms in the auditing subsector came into force in June 2016 in the aftermath of the financial crisis. One of the aims was to improve auditing quality, and to introduce rotation of auditors because of the concentration of the market. One of the tools envisaged in that regard was to facilitate cross-border provision of statutory audit services. Focusing more specifically on the temporary movement of natural persons supplying services, restrictions have decreased since 2008-2011 in European economies and in some other high-income countries (e.g. Canada, Japan, US). This was accomplished either by relaxing some of the economy-wide restrictions on the movement of persons (quantitative limitations), the lifting of nationality or residency requirements to obtain a license to practice, or the recognition of foreign qualifications.

To conclude, the last decade has seen steady and widespread liberalisation, but with a twist. While markets in services, e.g. finance and telecommunications, are increasingly free from explicit restrictions on entry and ownership, they are increasingly subject to greater regulatory scrutiny (e.g. economic needs tests, FDI screening), especially in higher income economies.

2020-06-20||The COVID-19 crisis is depressing growth globally, and lockdown measures are causing widespread job losses. This column illustrates that women are amongst the worst affected. Women are vulnerable not only because of their jobs, but also because of gender inequalities within housework division, education, and health. There is an urgent need to support women, repair gender disparities aggravated by crisis, and to reduce women’s vulnerability going forward. Gender-responsive fiscal measures are viable tools that work in the interests of women, as well as supporting economic growth and reducing poverty and inequality.

The COVID-19 pandemic has killed more than 400,000 people worldwide and has generated a massive global economic crisis. The world economy is projected to contract sharply by 3% in 2020 (IMF 2020) and poverty is set to rise for the first time since 1998, bringing 40-60 million people into extreme poverty (World Bank 2020). However, unlike previous economic crises, this crisis will negatively affect women more than men, creating a significant blow for gender equality. Policymakers should step up their efforts to reestablish the path towards a more equal society for men and women.

A huge setback in the quest for gender equality

Gender inequality had diminished over the past 30 years. For instance, the gap between male and female labour force participation decreased by eight percentage points due to the large gains in female labour force participation, especially within advanced economies (Figure 1). Educational attainment gaps also narrowed around the world with 35 countries having achieved full parity, and 120 countries closing at least 95% of their educational gender gaps (WEF 2020). The maternal mortality ratio had dropped by about 38% worldwide.

This encouraging progress, however, is likely to suffer huge setbacks during the COVID-19 crisis. There are various reasons why the current crisis disproportionally impacts women. First, women are more likely than men to work in social sectors (such as hospitality, retail, restaurants, and tourism), which require face-to-face interactions (Figure 2). These are the sectors that are being hit the hardest by social distancing (Hupkau and Petrongolo 2020). For example, in the US, almost 74% of women work in social sectors, compared to 48% of men (in 2019). Further, data for the first four months of the year indicate that employment in these sectors shrank by 18%, compared to 10% in other sectors (Shibata 2020). In developing countries, women are also more likely to be employed in social sectors than men. Notwithstanding, an even bigger concern in many of these countries is that women often work in the informal sector more frequently than men, and therefore have less job security and social protection, as well as lower pay (ILO 2018). Second, women, who usually carry the highest-burden of housework (Alonso et al. 2019, Alon et al. 2020), are bearing most of the epidemic-related costs triggered by school closures and the health risks posed to elderly family members. Uncertainty about schools reopening and fears of contagion of the most vulnerable can lead to women exiting the labour force for a prolonged period of time, entailing long-term costs to their careers. Third, in developing countries, the burden on the healthcare system is reducing access to family planning and increasing the chances of maternal mortality (UNPA Women 2020). Finally, in many developing economies (where girls in normal times already feel the pressure to drop out of school), the COVID-19 crisis may induce even more female dropouts. Dropping out from school creates a permanent loss in human capital and narrows girls’ chances of improving their living standards.

Note: Social sectors are defined as the sum of the following sectors: wholesale and retail trade, accommodation and food service activities, real estate, business and administrative activities, education, human health and social work activities and other services.

The policy challenge: Gender equality, boosting growth, and reducing poverty and inequality

Policymakers around the world are focusing on responding to the crisis’ immediate effects, fighting the devastating impact of the pandemic on people’s lives and national healthcare systems (Deb et al. 2020, Queisser at al. 2020), as well as trying to maintain functioning economies. Nevertheless, policymakers must also plan for the future. How can we return to a path of sustainable economic growth and regain the lost ground in gender equality, while fighting poverty and inequality? These are daunting tasks – but gender-responsive fiscal policies can help. The appropriate set of policies will depend, among other things, on the country’s level of development. For example, ensuring access to caregiving support (when economic activities outside of the household resume) is crucial for women to be able to go back to work in the developed world. In developing countries, increasing efforts to keep girls in school is key for building and protecting future human capital.

As shown in our recent paper (Fabrizio et al. 2020), fiscal policies that address gender equality (such as investing in education and infrastructure, subsidising childcare, and offering parental leave) can create economic opportunities for women. These policies also generate economic growth and reduce poverty and inequality, while paying for themselves in the long run. For example:
• Subsidised childcare. The high cost, and uneven supply, of childcare represents a barrier for many women (particularly the low-skilled and poor) to participate in the labour force. Poor women typically face higher childcare costs relative to their income. For example, in the US, poorer women spend 17.4% of their income on childcare, compared to 7.8% for richer women. These women are also at higher risk of losing their jobs because of the current pandemic. Subsidising childcare is a ‘win-win’ policy. It stimulates female labour force participation and generates jobs in the childcare sector. For illustration, life-cycle model simulations suggest that expanding childcare subsidies in order to reduce its cost by half (for middle-class working mothers) in the US would lead to an increase in female labour force participation by almost five percentage points. Women at the bottom of the income distribution (that currently do not have access to the Child Care Development Fund) would benefit the most. Our paper shows that this policy would reduce poverty in the US by up to 0.2 percentage points, and increase economic activity by up to 0.5 percent by widening the pool of workers.
• Investing in education. As argued above, the COVID-19 crisis can hamper progress made in closing gender gaps in education, as girls are usually the first to drop out of school if families need additional help at home. A more educated labour force is more resilient and flexible. Closing gender gaps in education boosts female human capital, raising women’s expected salaries and giving them more incentives to pursue careers. On aggregate, this would also positively impact productivity for the future, thus accelerating economic growth. For illustration, life-cycle model simulations suggest that investing sufficiently in education to close gender gaps at each income level in Senegal could boost output by almost 9%, while reducing poverty by more than ten percentage points, and cut inequality (as measured by the Gini coefficient) by almost three percentage points.

The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting all countries, destroying jobs, increasing poverty, and putting at risk the hard-won gender equality gains of the last few decades. Policymakers around the world are rightly focusing on responding to the immediate crisis, fighting the devastating effects of the pandemic on healthcare systems whist trying to keep their economies alive. The next step is to find the tools to sustain economic growth, fight poverty, and regain the lost ground in gender equality―gender-responsive fiscal policies are a viable answer.

2020-06-20||The protective metal boards surrounding Winston Churchill’s statue in Parliament Square came down this week ahead of French president Emmanuel Macron’s visit to London to mark a wartime anniversary. But the debate over Britain’s public monuments is not over and Oxford’s Oriel College said this week that it would move a statue of 19th-century imperialist Cecil Rhodes from its front entrance.

Boris Johnson said on Monday that instead of taking down controversial statues, Britain should put up new ones, pointing to empty plinths in the courtyard of the foreign and commonwealth office that were waiting to be occupied by contemporary heroes. Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy suggested that it was time to take a look at the art inside that building, notably a series of murals by Sigismund Goetze celebrating the expansion of the British Empire, one of which depicts Africa as a small naked boy carrying a basket of fruit.

“As we leave the European Union and start to reach out to other parts of the world, those relationships become incredibly important to us, particularly relationships with Commonwealth countries and countries that were part of the empire,” Nandy said in a Zoom interview from her home in Wigan this week.

“There is a very mixed legacy across the world for Britain in relation to that. And some of the works of art on display at the foreign office do not project the sort of relationship and the high esteem in which we hold those countries. And they depict many of those former empire countries as bending at the knee of the mighty British Empire, when what we seek in modern times is a partnership with those countries based on their strengths, assets and attributes and our own as well.”

Nandy’s family background embraces two sides of the legacy of the British Empire. Her father was Dipak Nandy, a Marxist academic who moved to Britain from Kolkata and helped to draft the Race Relations Act in 1976. Her mother Louise Byers, who was the daughter of Liberal MP Frank Byers, worked as a TV current affairs producer.

The MP for Wigan since 2010, Nandy served in the shadow cabinet under Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn but she resigned from Corbyn’s team in 2016 and backed Owen Smith’s unsuccessful leadership challenge. She ran for the leadership this year, coming third behind Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey.

The campaign enhanced Nandy’s reputation, however, as she outperformed her rivals in TV interviews and revealed herself to be a more complex politician than many Labour members had known. For the past few years, Nandy has been associated with efforts to keep Labour connected to its traditional heartlands outside London, championing the interests of towns and opposing the push for a second Brexit referendum.

She lost the argument within the party before the election when she was calling for Labour to join forces with moderate Conservatives to back a soft Brexit deal. But she is now in the mainstream alongside Labour leader Starmer in accepting that the central Brexit argument is over and refusing to press the government to extend the transition period beyond the end of this year.

“We’ve been smashed apart in the Labour Party over Brexit. Not just our electoral coalition, but our party membership, our members of parliament as well over the last four years. But we’re now in a position where we saw the entire Labour base collapse beneath our feet in many of those parts of the country that voted to leave and that had traditionally voted Labour through three successive generations,” she said.

“I think there’s now a recognition right across the Labour movement that we’ve got to get a deal by the end of the year. And we’ve also got to stand up for those very close, deep relationships with the EU as a whole and with individual countries within the European Union more generally.”

Nandy says that Labour’s foreign policy will not change in its essentials and the party will remain internationalist in outlook with a commitment to human rights and the rule of law. But she has adopted a tougher stance on China, finding common cause with some Conservative MPs in questioning the role of Chinese companies like Huawei in British infrastructure.

“We think you need a twin-pillar strategy in relation to China. On the one hand, you need the strategic independence by investing in homegrown industry and by building those alliances overseas to give us a degree of detachment that allows us to speak and act from a position of values,” she said.

“But equally, you need a level of constructive engagement with China. There is no global challenge that can be solved without the involvement of the Chinese government, whether it’s Covid-19, climate change or the issues in the world economy, reform of our major institutions. China remains a very, very important partner for the world. Often the situation with the US and China is likened to the cold war. We believe it isn’t at all. It’s far more complex than the cold war and we’ve got to maintain those links.”

Labour has remained part of the Party of European Socialists and Nandy believes the party can learn from the experience of other centre-left parties. She suggests that most such parties have faced the same challenge of trying to keep together two parts of an electoral coalition that have experienced globalisation very differently.

Although she recognises how steep Labour’s challenge is, she draws some hope from the fact that the party under Starmer recognises that it must move beyond what she calls the “one more heave” mentality.

“There’s a sort of mythology on the left around and around our history in Britain, that after the war the country realised that this was a huge moment when things had to change and we were propelled to power where we built the institutions, the NHS and the welfare state that have lasted to this day. Now, that is true but what we forget is that six years later, we were out of power and we’ve largely been in retreat, trying to defend those institutions ever since.

“So there’s a real need for Labour to go out into the country and start to make the case for how we’re going to bring different parts of the country together, particularly with the length and depth of the recession that’s about to hit,” she said.

“I think that is likely to be concentrated in many of those areas that already lacked the resilience before. So coastal towns, which are heavily reliant on the tourism industry, are likely to see a disproportionate impact. And we’ve got a lot of ex-industrial towns where the last Labour government used the public sector to try to kickstart the economy. And as the public sector is contracted, that’s left us with a real problem.

“The other jobs that exist in those places are not well-paid, white-collar jobs. They’re the insecure agency jobs. So for all of those reasons, the parts of the country that we’re seeking to win back at the next election are going to feel the impact of this economic recession harder. And we’ve got to make sure that we are their champion.”||0
2020-06-20||Japanese geisha "Chacha" sits on her knees with her fingertips neatly placed on the wooden floor, gracefully bowing to an audience sitting not in front of her but miles away, watching online.

Beneath spotlights, the graceful 32-year-old geisha performs a traditional dance, moving like a butterfly and artfully unfolding and fluttering her fan.

The audience would usually be a group of older, wealthy men, watching appreciatively inside a traditional parlour lined with woven tatami mats.

But today, Chacha's audience is looking back at her from a computer screen, and ranges from a young woman with a glass of wine in her hand to a family with several curious children.

"How have you been at home?" asked Chacha, addressing her audience.

"I was playing 'Animal Crossing' all the time during the state of emergency!" she added.

While Japan has been spared the worst of the coronavirus outbreak, a state of emergency was declared during a spike in cases and the pandemic has nixed most forms of nightlife, including geisha parties.

Despite Western misconceptions, geishas are not prostitutes, but rather entertainers and raconteurs highly skilled in traditional Japanese dance, musical instruments and games.

Almost everything in the repertoire of these performers – from singing and dancing in small enclosed spaces, to entertaining customers with witty conversation and delicately pouring sake in a customer's cup – is at odds with the social distancing rules of the coronavirus pandemic.

That has been devastating for geisha like Chacha, who has seen her salary evaporate and is eagerly awaiting the arrival of government stimulus funds.

"Usually we are very busy in April, May and June," she told AFP. "But this year, we have no parties, zero."

That's where the online service has come in.

It grew from a project called "Meet Geisha" – initially conceived as a way to bring groups of tourists to see geisha perform on stage in a more relaxed and less intimidating environment.

Launched last year by an IT firm, it was supposed to capitalise on an influx of tourists, including those coming for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

But with the coronavirus pandemic forcing the postponement of the Games and shutting down international travel, the firm looked at other options.

They approached the geisha community in Hakone, around 80km southwest of Tokyo, about an online option, said project manager Tamaki Nishimura.

"They are up for new challenges, not necessarily bound by traditional styles," she told AFP.

While geisha culture is strongly associated with the city of Kyoto, communities exist throughout Japan, with about 150 active geishas in Hakone.

"If it weren't for the geishas in Hakone, I wouldn't probably have gotten a yes for the online service," Nishimura added.

Chacha admits she was initially confused by the idea – she doesn't own a computer, just an iPad, and says she has no idea how to even switch one on.

"I had a big question mark in my head," she laughed.

But with Nishimura's help to organise the technical side, Chacha and a handful of other geishas are now able to offer their traditional arts in the most modern of formats – Zoom calls.

The online sessions offer income, but also a way to broaden the audience.

"One objective of this service is to reach out to new, younger customer groups because the price is set at the cheaper end," Nishimura said.

"Once we had a group of eight young people in South Korea who bought this service as a birthday present for one of them. That was a way of enjoying this that went beyond what we had expected."

Michiko Maeda, 65, one of Chacha's online female guests, said the new format had encouraged her to experience the traditional entertainment.

"I think many people feel that geisha entertainment is not really for women," she said.

"But once you know women can also enjoy it, intially online, I think more of us will go and visit Hakone geisha parlours. Right, everyone?" she said, as other female guests nodded in agreement on the split screen.

Chacha acknowledges the new technology "allows people overseas and those who cannot physically visit Hakone to meet me".

But she is hoping for a return to tradition when the rules allow.

"Someday I want them to come here, see our performance live and interact with us for real. That is what I truly wish for." – AFP Relaxnews||2
2020-06-20||The impact of COVID-19 on insurers

The grim impact of COVID-19 – extensive financial dislocations across asset classes and potentially large increases in morbidity and mortality – could pose a challenge to the insurance industry, particularly life insurers. This column urges central banks looking to preserve credit supply to account for changes in insurer risk appetite, which could take place well before capital levels approach regulatory thresholds. Financial stability assessments should examine the implications of the pandemic for insurers, which operate in some countries on a comparable scale to banks.

While much attention has been paid to the impact of COVID-19 on banks (for examples of prominent early work, see Beck 2020, Cecchetti and Schoenholtz 2020), insurers have received less attention. Insurers are important financial intermediaries, holding more than $30 trillion in assets globally (FSB 2020), and operating on a comparable scale to banks in some countries.

COVID-19 will affect insurers both directly, via health shocks (increases in mortality and morbidity), and indirectly, via financial shocks (higher credit spreads, potentially widespread downgrades, lower interest rates, and lower equity prices). The financial impact of pandemics is often much larger than the direct health impact, as even comparatively mild outbreaks can have a large economic footprint (McKibbin and Fernando 2020).

Insurers’ exposure to COVID-19 varies by their line of business. For example, life insurers’ liabilities commit them to payouts decades ahead, and are very sensitive to changes in interest rates. Although these long-term liabilities permit longer investment horizons, potentially supporting financial stability (Chodorow-Reich et al. 2020, IAIS 2019), life insurers are more directly affected by pandemics through their liabilities. If insurers are hit hard, risk appetite may be impaired—as was the case following the global financial crisis (Kirti 2019)—affecting the availability of credit for riskier borrowers. Policymakers working to preserve credit supply to the economy should account for any changes to insurers’ risk appetite.

We present estimates of the impact of COVID-19 on capitalisation levels for US life insurers, considering both the direct pandemic shock and the indirect financial shock.

Life insurers provide protection against both mortality and longevity risk. Joint provision of both types of protection can help insurers manage risk. In a pandemic with significant mortality impact, life insurance claims rise immediately, whereas expected future payments on life-contingent annuities fall. These risks can therefore offset each other from a long-term solvency perspective, although large life insurance claims may have a meaningful short-term impact. Moreover, for annuities in the accumulation phase, as is the case for a majority of US annuities, account values are typically payable upon death.

We focus on the impact of potentially larger mortality on life insurance claims. We base key assumptions (share of population with coverage and average size of policy by age group, and the extent to which mortality may be lower conditional on coverage) on SOA (2007) and apply case fatality rates by age group as experienced in Korea (a more benign scenario) or Italy (a more severe scenario with limited health care capacity) as of early June.

Although the pandemic appears to be tapering in Europe and even in the US as of early June 2020, it is difficult to exclude further waves of infections. Figure 1 shows the impact on US life insurers as a share of capital given the share of the population affected by COVID-19. Insurers, regulators, and industry observers typically use an excess death ratio of 1.5 per 1,000 as a standard pandemic stress test scenario. In the US, this would imply about 500,000 deaths (about 8% of the population affected with case fatality rates in Korea, and about 4% with case fatality rates in Italy), larger than current estimates of the potential death toll released by US authorities. In such a scenario, losses would be about $15 billion, or about 3% of pre-shock industry capital.4 Should the pandemic prove challenging to control (with treatment and vaccines remaining elusive), an extreme scenario more comparable to the 1918 Spanish flu (closer to 30% of the population affected with case fatality rates in Korea) could become relevant. In such a scenario, losses would be about $45-55 billion—about 10% of pre-shock capital. Such a scenario would likely unfold over multiple years, giving insurers time to accumulate additional net premium income.

Figure 1 Impact of potential mortality claims on US life insurer regulatory capital

Sources: S&P Global Market Intelligence and IMF staff analysis.

Note: This figure shows the US life insurance industry’s aggregate capital net of pre-tax excess claims as a function of the share of population infected. Estimates are based on the age-group-specific number of policyholders and average face amount in force used by SOA (2007), adjusted to match the current US population and stock of life insurance in force net of reinsurance as of end 2019 (close to $20 trillion). Case fatality rates by age group as of 3 June 2020 are from the Italian National Institute of Health and the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare. Case fatality rates are assumed to be 23% lower for the insured population as in the severe scenario used by SOA (2007).

US life insurers are generally not required to mark bonds to market for the purpose of determining regulatory capital. Capital requirements for US insurers are tied to regulatory risk categorisation of assets. For most asset classes, regulatory risk categories are a function of credit ratings. US life insurers’ holdings are somewhat skewed toward bonds only one or two rating notches above regulatory thresholds for significantly higher risk weights (Kirti and Shin 2020, Becker and Ivashina 2015).[vii] Risk weights for junk bonds are more than triple those for investment grade bonds. Downgraded bonds tend to be sold by insurers facing capital pressure (Ellul et al. 2011). We focus on the impact of bond downgrades on required capital.

Despite unprecedented policy responses from monetary and fiscal authorities, many corporate issuers may face rating downgrades due to the widespread economic fallout from COVID-19; the extent to which some sectors will face serious solvency concerns in any ‘new normal’ is not yet clear. If downgrades move assets into higher-risk regulatory categories, capital requirements would increase. Downgraded bonds may see fire sales, particularly if downgrades are widespread, although selling distressed assets would potentially trigger recognition of losses that permanently impair regulatory capital for US insurers, which would disincentivise fire sales.

We use bond-level holdings data for all US life insurers as of the fourth quarter of 2019, along with bond ratings (and downgrades) as of end-May. More than $60 billion in bond holdings have already been downgraded across categories, while $210 billion have been downgraded at least one rating notch. We consider two further scenarios: a moderate scenario in which 50% of bonds (by value) one notch away from regulatory thresholds are downgraded into the next category, along with 25% of bonds two notches away; and a severe scenario with double these downgrade rates.

Figure 2 shows how risk-based capital (RBC) ratios (the ratio of actual capital held to required capital) would be affected under different scenarios. US insurers must submit corrective action plans if their RBC ratio is below 150% and has a negative trend, or falls below 100%, and can be placed under regulatory control if their RBC ratio falls below 50%.10 The median RBC ratio is above 400%, with some insurers already below 200%. The severe downgrade scenario would significantly lower RBC ratios and bring some insurers close to or below company action thresholds.

Figure 2 Impact of potential bond downgrades on US life insurer RBC ratios

Note: This figure shows the distribution of RBC ratios for (1) the current level (as reported in 2019), (2) the actual level (accounting for actual downgrades to date), (3) the moderate scenario (half of one-rating-notch-above and a quarter of two-rating-notches-above corporate bonds are downgraded into the next NAIC category), and (4) the severe scenario (all of one-rating-notch-above and half of two-rating-notches-above corporate bonds are downgraded into the next NAIC category). The RBC ratio is total adjusted capital divided by two times authorised control level (required) capital. The figure is restricted to insurers with assets of more than $5 billion. Observations outside the 10th and 90th percentiles are not shown.

Joint impact of health and financial shocks

Figure 3 illustrates the joint impact of the health and financial shocks. Panel A shows an indicative aggregate RBC ratio in three increasingly severe scenarios in addition to the pre-shock level: (1) the upper end of a mortality scenario presented by US authorities in late March (240,000 deaths) along with rating downgrades as of end May; (2) deaths in a standard pandemic stress test scenario (1.5 excess deaths per 1,000, or about 500,000 deaths) combined with the moderate financial shock scenario; and (3) deaths in line with Spanish flu (using excess deaths in the US reported by Barro et al. 2020) combined with the severe financial shock scenario (1.7 million deaths).

Panel B shows the impact for the largest US life insurers by net life insurance in force for the same set of scenarios. Under severe joint shock scenarios, capital levels for several large insurers would approach, and in the case of one insurer breach, regulatory thresholds.

2020-06-19||The actor, 41, has been at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles for weeks as he recovers from complications from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

Cordero's wife, Amanda Kloots, shared an update on his condition two days after she asked for prayers that "Nick's blood pressure gets better."

"Do you guys want to know some good news, and the power of prayer?" Kloots shared Friday on her Instagram Stories. "Yesterday, Nick's blood pressure in the morning, his medicine was at 32 mcg, now it's at 3."

Kloots, who shares son Elvis, who turned 1 earlier this month, with Cordero, paid him a visit on Friday.

"Guess where I'm heading!!!" Kloots wrote on her Instagram Stories atop a screen shot of her ICU visitation confirmation. She then shared a photo of her visitor's badge to the hospital along with a GIF that read "Hallelujah."

Sharing a photo of the outside of the hospital, the fitness instructor wrote, "Everyday."

On Thursday, Kloots shared that Cordero has "lost 65 lbs." while in the ICU and that "he's so weak that he still can't move and his muscles are definitely atrophying."

"This is really hard because what Nick has lost is muscle. His muscles are just atrophied," she said during a Q&A on her Instagram Stories. "You can't really gain your muscle back until you can move, so they have him on some high protein and high calorie food, but he's gotta move."

While Cordero woke up from his medically induced coma in early May, he is still unable to speak "because of the ventilator," Kloots said, adding, "he can't move because he's so weak, but he is awake and he's in there. He can answer yes or no questions with his eyes."

Kloots said on Thursday that the goal was to get Cordero's blood pressure "under control," as it had been "all over the place" this week.

With her update on Friday, it seems they are on the right track to achieve that goal.

On Friday, Kloots shared a photo from the hospital holding her husband's hand.

She captioned the post with lyrics from "Don’t Give Up On Me" by Andy Grammer, which include the words, "I will fight, I will fight for you, I always do until my heart, Is black and blue."||0

HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) -- Five-time PGA Tour winner Nick Watney tested positive Friday for the coronavirus, the first player with a confirmed infection since golf resumed a full schedule last week.

Watney immediately withdrew from the RBC Heritage and must self-isolate for at least 10 days under the PGA Tour's protocols.

He did not return a telephone call seeking comment. Watney played the opening round with Vaughn Taylor and Luke List, and a rules official notified them at the turn of the positive test.

''I was a little shocked, to be honest,'' Taylor said. ''Heart started racing, got a little nervous. Just hope Nick is doing well and we get through this.''

Watney missed the cut last week in the Charles Schwab Challenge at Colonial in Fort Worth, Texas. He traveled on his own to South Carolina, and his coronavirus test upon arrival at Harbour Town was negative.

Before arriving to the course for his second round, he reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Watney was tested again, and the result came back positive.

Si Woo Kim saw him in passing on the range, and Rory McIlroy said he chatted with Watney on the putting green. McIlroy said they were at a distance, and that Watney sent him a text about the positive result after McIlroy finished his round.

''He was just saying, 'Look, I hope I didn't get too close to you.' He feels badly that he was here today at the golf course,'' McIlroy said. ''I said to him, 'If I was in your position, I probably would have been here, too. At this point, you just have to concentrate on getting better and getting healthy.'''

List won last week on the Korn Ferry Tour, where one player and three caddies tested positive before the event and did not come to the courses, and two non-players tested positive before this week's event, both in Florida.

He missed the cut at Hilton Head with a 73.

''It was hard to concentrate out there for me, just thinking about different stuff, and I wasn't playing my best, anyway,'' List said. ''It would be nice if they had an option - you can kind of say if you want to know or not in a situation like that. I would definitely like to find out after the round next time.''

As for another test, List said even if tested, ''it might not show up until a few days down the road. So there's a lot of different scenarios.''

The tour had no positive tests of the 487 administered at Colonial, and none among the 98 players tested before taking the charter to Hilton Head or the 369 tests for those arriving on their own.

Jordan Spieth, one of four players on the PGA Tour's policy board, didn't sound surprised at golf's first positive test.

''The whole plan put in place was not if, but when somebody tests positive, what's the protocol, and what are the next steps,'' Spieth said. ''So I feel confident, just in being on those phone calls, in what the PGA Tour is going to do going forward. Hopefully, contact tracing doesn't lead to anybody else testing positive within the bubble.''

The tour said in a statement it has started its response plan, which includes those who have had close contact with Watney. It said it would have no further statement.

Taylor, who made the cut with two strokes to spare, said he had no close contact with Watney on Thursday, and he washed his hands immediately after the round.

''Nick never coughed or sneezed, so I feel comfortable,'' he said.

As part of the contact tracing plan, Taylor, List and their caddies were to be tested immediately.

''If you contract it, that's fine, but then it's the fact that who have you come into contact with, and who you might have exposed and stuff,'' McIlroy said. ''Look, we're still in the middle of a pandemic. Until this thing's over, we all just have to stay vigilant and keep your distance and wear our masks if we're going out in public and keep washing our hands.''

The PGA Tour is scheduled to play next week in Cromwell, Connecticut, where the Travelers Championship is testing everyone - including volunteers and media - who will be on property.

Tournament organizers made that decision. The PGA Tour has tried to create a bubble of its key people at tournaments, designating player hotels as an option and urging everyone in the bubble to avoid outside contact. Some players have been renting houses. There is no regulation if they choose to eat out.

Hilton Head has been particularly busy this week, with local restaurants packed with people who typically come to this quiet island on the Atlantic coast for vacation.

''South Carolina's open. If you go anywhere to a restaurant, there's a lot of people there right now,'' Spieth said. ''So I guess that's probably best case is that he got it on his own outside'' the bubble.

Sebastian Munoz said ''there's just too many people hanging around'' the island.

''It's a pandemic, you know? A lot of people get it, and eventually one of us was going to get it,'' Munoz said. ''I feel good that we caught early with one guy so far. So hopefully, it doesn't rise up pretty quick.''

Under the tour's guidelines for a positive test, Watney is to self-isolate for at least 10 days. He can end his self-isolation after 10 days provided he has no subsequent symptoms or has two negative test results 24 hours apart or more.

The tour will provide a stipend to pay for the costs of his self-isolation.

Watney's most recent victory was in 2012 at Bethpage Black in the FedEx Cup playoff opener. He has struggled to regain his top form since missing 10 months in 2016 because of back surgery.||0

As cases in the state of California hit a new record, Los Angles County’s numbers fell on Thursday from county’s own recent record highs.

On Friday the county announced it had recorded 1,414 new cases for Thursday. That was down from a record 2,126 new cases reported on Wednesday. Wednesday’s number also included 600 delayed cases from one testing lab.

By comparison, there were 1633 new cases in the county as of last Friday, according to the health department. That was the third-highest one day total since the outbreak began, according the L.A. county coronavirus dashboard. Friday’s number included 500 delayed cases from one lab.

Last Thursday, the Department of Public Health reported 1,857 new confirmed coronavirus cases. Before this Wednesday’s numbers were released, last Thursday represented the largest single-day number of new cases announced by the county during the entire pandemic. But health officials said, again, roughly 600 of those cases were the result of a backlog in the reporting of test results. Long Beach and Pasadena, which have their own health departments, combined to confirm an additional 84 cases. That gave the county 1,941 new confirmed cases total last Thursday.

Daily testing numbers over the same period remained steady, or fell slightly, according to L.A. County’s testing chart.

In the midst of this up-and-down, on Thursday California Governor Gavin Newsom issued at statewide order mandating masks in public places.

On Friday, Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer added her voice to the chorus urging residents to wear masks:

Since May 13, Public Health has been requiring that everyone wear a cloth face covering when in contact with others not in their household. A lot of questions are raised about why this is important, especially by individuals who are not worried about becoming infected themselves. The important issue here is that we are not asking you to wear the face covering to protect yourself. We ask you to cover your mouth and nose to protect others, especially since you can be infected with COVID-19 and have no illness symptoms; this is how you keep your respiratory droplets from reaching someone else.

2020-06-19||Soccer has taken Manheim Township alum Jaclyn Poucel Árnason from Neffsville to a college career at the University of Pittsburgh to a pro career in Finland, Iceland and Scotland.

But she felt it necessary to retire from the game game in 2017 in order to pursue other passions.

“It was taking too much of a toll on my mental health,” Poucel Árnason said recently. “I had spent so much time on it (soccer) my whole life that I never was able to give myself the opportunity to do other things.”

Those other things have since blossomed into a career as an artist and a part-time educator teaching students in Iceland how to speak English.

Poucel Árnason has been living in Iceland since January, about a month after marrying Benedikt Árnason, an Iceland native who also plays professional soccer.

“When my former team heard I was moving back to Iceland they wanted me to play again,” Poucel Árnason said.

That Icelandic team is IA Akranes, for which Poucel Árnason played in 2016.

“I started training in January,” Poucel Árnason said. “Before the pandemic shut things down.”

In its early stages, the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc among Iceland’s small population of less than 370,000 residents. By comparison, Lancaster County’s 2019 population was more than 545,000 people.

Thanks to a rigorous protocol of tracking and tracing in Iceland, the coronavirus has more or less been eliminated, leading to the country reopening its borders June 15.

According to a recent report from CNN.com, three per 100,000 people in Iceland tested positive for the coronavirus.

“Iceland did a very good job at shutting down quickly and upholding the rules being told to us by our government,” Poucel Árnason said.

As a result, pro sports in Iceland has returned in recent weeks.

“500 people are now allowed to be in one area,” Poucel Árnason said. “So depending on the stadium or game, each section can only have 500 (spectators) and it has to have its own entrance and toilet access.”

IA Akranes is already two games into its 2020 season, with Poucel Árnason having tallied three goals despite playing from her primary position as a central defender. Not too bad for someone who hadn’t played the sport professionally in about three years.

“I was rusty for like a week,” Poucel Árnason said. “When it comes to the technical soccer side, that stuff comes back quickly. But, physically, it’s been difficult because my body hasn’t been used to being used in that way anymore. I’ve had a lot more muscle stiffness and I’m taking longer to recover than I used to.”

As for how long Poucel intends to keep playing is another question.

“I am taking it year by year,” she said. “It’s hard to say how I’ll feel and I think it would also depend on how we do. I, of course, would love to play as long as I can physically ... and within the next few years we’d like to start a family. So nothing is set in stone yet.”

For now, she’s trying to appreciate living in the moment.

“I’ve been gifted this opportunity to return to something that used to bring me so much joy and that I thought I’d never feel again,” Poucel said. “So I’m just cherishing that my body is still able to play at a high level I love. I’m just trying to stay present."||0

2020-06-19|BENGALURU: The districts of Kalaburagi and Udupi have reported more than 1,000 Covid-19 cases each, but seen 11 and 2 deaths, respectively,whereas Bengaluru, with 982 cases, has reported 58 fatalities. Bengaluru’s case fatality rate (CFR) at 6% is more than that of Mumbai (5.2%) and Chennai (1.5%), both of which have more than 30,000 cases.What’s driving up the CFR — or, the number of deaths for every 100 positive cases — in Bengaluru? According to experts, it’s a combination of factors: Change of hospitals midway through treatment, late diagnosis and delay in presentation of the case.Experts said a proactive district administration and involvement of private healthcare sector, especially MAHE’s Dr TMA Pai Hospital, in Udupi made a huge difference. Kalaburagi doctors, who are also shouldering burden of neighbouring districts, credited their achievement to teamwork.Dr KS Manjunath, director, Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital, said Udupi and Kalaburagi’s cases are mainly Maharashtra returnees, who are mostly asymptomatic. “Bengaluru has cases of Influenza-Like Illness and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection seeking treatment with delayed presentation. The golden hour is lost by the time the patient is brought to Covid-19 hospital,” he said.Bowring hospital has 15 Covid-19 patients in its ICU. Stating that it’s a complex situation, Dr Manjunath said, “It’s observed that cytokine storm (where the body starts to attack its own cells) and sudden thrombosis (formation of blood clots) are leading to Covid-19 deaths. These conditions are beyond doctors’ control. The focus should be in preventing such a situation and that can be achieved with early intervention,” he said.Most deaths in Bengaluru are among patients with two or more comorbidities and more than 70% of them are aged over 50, said Dr Giridhara R Babu, an epidemiologist.|1
2020-06-19||(Reuters) - Troubling spikes in coronavirus infection rates were reported on Friday in several U.S. states, mainly in the South and West, a day before President Donald Trump was due to preside over an Oklahoma campaign rally that will be America’s largest indoor gathering in months.

Wall Street jitters over a resurgence in COVID-19 cases as states moved to reopen long-stifled commerce and ease social-distancing measures helped drive down major U.S. stock indexes, reversing earlier gains.

Experts say expanded diagnostic testing accounts for some, but not all, of the growth in cases - numbering at least 2.23 million nationwide on Friday - and that the mounting volume of infections was elevating hospitalizations in some places.

“Clearly the cases are rising rapidly. It’s not just a matter of testing more,” said Dr. Murtaza Akhter, an emergency room physician at Arizona hospitals, noting the lag time between a positive test and severe illness or death. “The real concern is what is coming up for us in the next week or two.”

He said the latest wave of cases has put Arizona’s major hospitals at or near capacity, and placed the Southwestern state on track to surpass New York at its peak on a per-capita basis.

More than 119,000 Americans have perished from COVID-19 to date, according to Reuters’ running tally.

Particularly alarming has been the upward trends several states are reporting in the percentage of positive tests among individuals who are screened, a metric experts refer to as the positivity rate.

The World Health Organization considers positivity rates above 5% to be especially concerning, and widely watched data from Johns Hopkins University shows 16 states with average rates over the past week exceeding that level and climbing.

Four were averaging double-digit rates - Arizona at 17%, Alabama at 12%, Washington state at 11% and South Carolina at 10%. The dozen others were led by Utah, Texas, Mississippi, Florida and Georgia, all averaging rates of 7.5% or higher.

Some of the latest daily figures were also disconcerting.

Arizona, where doctors and public health administrators have called for making face coverings mandatory in public, reported a record 3,246 new infections over the previous 24 hours, nearly twice those tallied on Wednesday. Its latest single-day positivity rate, from Thursday, stood at 18.6%.

In Phoenix, where the president is due to visit a church next Tuesday for a “Students for Trump” event, the city council voted at the mayor’s urging on Friday to mandate face coverings in most public places. That move came two days after Governor Doug Ducey issued an executive order allowing cities and counties to require face coverings.

Florida, one of the last states to impose stay-at-home restrictions and one of the first to begin lifting them, reported 3,822 new cases, a daily record. Its latest positivity figure was 10%, according to the state’s health department.

“The situation in Florida and Arizona is really concerning,” William Hanage, an epidemiology professor at Harvard University, adding that the spike in cases was not just due to more testing but indicative of an “underlying outbreak of unknown size.”

Even if the growth in confirmed cases partly reflects transmission among younger people less likely to be hospitalized, those people could infect the elderly and other vulnerable individuals with underlying health conditions.

“The more community transmission there is, the larger the risk that it infects somebody who is vulnerable. There are quite a lot of old people in Florida and in Arizona,” Hanage said.

Another focus of concern was in Oklahoma, where the Trump campaign will hold a rally on Saturday at a 19,000-seat indoor arena in Tulsa, his first such event since lockdowns were imposed across much of the country in March.

Public health experts have warned that assembling thousands of shouting, chanting people inside the BOK Center and an adjacent convention hall poses the risk of creating a “super-spreader” event for the highly contagious coronavirus.

Rally organizers plan to hand out masks and hand sanitizer to attendees before they enter the venue, but they will not be required to maintain social distancing or wear face coverings. They also must sign a waiver promising not to sue Trump or the campaign if they contract the virus.

Trump supporters began lining up outside the arena well in advance. One of them, Randall Thom, 60, from Lakefield, Minnesota, said on Friday the United States needed to reopen.

“We can’t be afraid of this China virus or whatever you guys want to call it. I’m not afraid of it at all,” he said. “And I am so honored that President Trump wants to do a trade for us as citizens, you know, to give us our rights to be normal again.”||0
2020-06-21||Businesses responding to the third statewide COVID-19 Wisconsin Business Impact survey continue to demonstrate their resilience with 41 percent of respondents introducing or expanding online services over the last three months.

Similarly, businesses continue to seek financial assistance, with 60 percent of respondents requesting assistance and 52.4 percent receiving aid. Estimates of business survivability have also increased, with only 10 percent of respondents estimating survivability of less than three months.

“It will be important to continue to assess this measure throughout the summer,” said MadREP President Paul Jadin. “Many businesses will continue to operate with significant restrictions, and we need to understand the impact to appropriately respond and support those businesses, so they are able to survive.”

The June survey of businesses impacted by the effects of COVID-19 yielded 744 results, a significant decrease from the 1,126 responses received in May and 2,424 received in April. According to Jeffrey Sachse, interim director of the Center for Customized Research and Services, the decline in participation is attributed to two related issues. “We noted a strong correlation among businesses that reported low survivability and non-response in the May survey results. This trend continued this month.” Similarly, the survey period of June 1-13 correlates with the beginning of the summer tourism season and comes three weeks after the reopening of the state. A decrease in response was anticipated as business owners continue the process of resuming operations. The results shared here are estimated from self-reported data and is subject to a 3 percent margin of error.

In May 2020, responding businesses reported losses of:

Each of these figures mark a significant decrease from previous months. The inventory loss estimate is especially notable as it represents a 67 percent decrease when reported on a per firm basis. Income losses are 58 percent lower than May estimates on a per firm basis, but only 15 percent below April estimates. It is again important to note that May activity more closely resembles March in that businesses were able to operate more fully in roughly half of each month.

Most responding firms reported being open for business, with 14 percent needing additional resources to do so or deciding not to open. Five percent of responding firms also reported hiring staff in the past month. Many firms expect the losses attributed to the pandemic to continue through the remainder of 2020, with several firms reporting that losses are just beginning to appear.

“The June Business Impact Survey results illustrate a business community that is reopening,” Sachse added. “Like any economic shock or natural disaster, the early days of this process have brought a reassessment of conditions and plans to move forward. Responding businesses have proven extremely resilient but challenges remain in tourism-driven and customer-facing industries. The July survey results will present a clearer picture of business in this ‘new normal.’”

The July Business Impact Survey will be sent to responding businesses and partner organizations from July 1 to 12. The COVID-19 Business Impact Survey is a partnership of the Center for Customized Research and Services, the state’s nine Regional Development Organizations, and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.

2020-06-21||It was early September last year and Roy Keane was in Dublin with Gary Neville for a gig at the Bord Gáis Energy Theatre, talking about their Manchester United glory years.

At the Marker Hotel, alongside the theatre, I was introduced to Keane a few hours before he went on stage. I’d never spoken to him before, but we got talking over a coffee. It was a chat, not an interview — that much was made clear. Very definitely not an interview.

The previous weekend, Dublin and Kerry had played out a draw in the All-Ireland football final. Had I been to the game, he asked? I told him I’d spent the day at Temple Street Hospital with my four-year-old after she’d broken her arm at the playground.

“That’s not a real injury,” he smiled. “She could have gotten the bus in herself.”

Coffee over, he autographed a white napkin from a table nearby for my son and said goodbye.

That week, I emailed his agent about a possible interview. It was politely declined . . . maybe some other time.

That usually means ‘never’, but every now and then this business can surprise you. Nine months later, locked down at home along with the rest of us, Keane had the time and the inclination to talk. We agreed to speak at 1pm the following day. He called right on the button.

It was a week before he returned — explosively — to a TV analyst role with Sky Sports, savaging Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea and defender Harry Maguire at half-time in Friday’s 1-1 draw at Tottenham. For many, the real talking point on the night was Keane, rather than the game.

But that was hardly a surprise, for he has always been box office.

Barry Egan: What’s the difference between Roy Keane, the football legend and Roy Keane, the man who walks his dog?

Roy Keane: I’m not into all this legend stuff. You put your boots on now and you’re a legend, particularly in Ireland. You play five games for Ireland and you’re a legend. You score one goal you’re a legend. Scratch your arse and you’re a legend.

When I was going to matches — and I had this throughout my career, going back to Rockmount — I was going to work . . . I was going to work. And I’d like to think I am a different person away from my job. I’m not saying it’s chalk and cheese. But I was going to earn a living, trying to help my team win a match.

At every level I have played, I was trying to win matches. Since I was eight years of age, I took football very, very seriously.

BE: Do you ever think about things like your legacy?

RK: Nah, listen. That’s certainly not something I would be comfortable with. That’s not my scene. If I had a bucket in front of me now, I’d be throwing up.

BE: If I told you that you couldn’t play, you’d be more comfortable.

RK: I’m more comfortable with criticism. You’re right.

RK: It keeps you on your toes.

BE: Did you get positive stuff from your family growing up?

RK: [Laughs] No, not really! Are you joking? I still haven’t got it. Christ almighty! It didn’t work that way, as you know. Typical Irish family. Just got on with it. My family will probably tell me that my three brothers were better players than me.

BE: And were they?

RK: I’d say so, yeah. They were very good players. They played at a very good level. And if they had the luck I had, it could have been them. Most sports people weren’t as good as they thought they were. I never won a trophy in my career at Man United or Celtic or Rockmount. The team did.

BE: Where did that come from?

RK: From eight years of age I played the game to win. Would I give that advice to kids now? Obviously not. But I played to win.

I was from a competitive family. I’m a Keane, but my mother’s a Lynch. Sport is in her family. I have sport running through my blood. So, along the way, I was going to push people. I had to.

A good old Irish friend said to me years ago, ‘Roy, you just need to lighten up a small bit.’ And I try. I try to lighten up. But regarding football, I couldn’t lighten up, because if I lightened up too much in football, I would never have got to England. And if I did, I wouldn’t have lasted two minutes.

I had to be intense. I had to train properly. I had to push myself. I had to push people around me. I don’t make apologies for that. That was who I was. Even pre-season, any game I ever took it easy in, I guarantee you I was the worst player on the park.

I couldn’t do it. I just couldn’t do it. It just wasn’t in my make-up. And sometimes that would rattle a few people, even in training. I’d go, ‘I can’t do it [take it easier]. I wish I could. I just can’t.’ I wish I had. You know when you want to let a bit of steam off? I couldn’t. If I thought, ‘We’ve no game for two weeks and my hamstring is a bit tight, I’ll just go easy’, I couldn’t do it. I had to be full pelt.

BE: Why was that?

RK: Fear. Fear of failure. Fear of letting people down. When I came to England, I had wanted to be a professional player for a long time. I wanted to win trophies. I wanted security for my family. I wanted a nice house. I wanted a nice holiday. I wanted a nice car.

BE: What are you frightened of now? Some people who have that fear earlier on in life, it just keeps transferring on to other fears.

RK: Not for me, thank God. It was that football bubble that I was in. There is no guarantee that I’ll be doing TV next year. There are no deals lined up. I’m speaking to one or two, [but] if none of these things fall into place I am actually quite relaxed. And maybe that’s because I am out of football now.

I have always loved the game. I don’t always like what goes on around the game. If people want to pigeonhole me and say, ‘He’s this or that, the legend stuff, or ‘he’s an oddball’ . . . listen, my job was to win football matches. And generally speaking, the teams I played with were all okay with my attitude to the game. Did I always get it right? I made mistakes, like everybody else.

BE: What mistakes did you make?

RK: Stuff like letting teammates down by getting sent off. Sometimes I would try and push them. Sometimes I was too hard. Sometimes I was too soft. If I was critical, looking back on my own career and how I dealt with people, even in management — and people mightn’t believe this — but I reckon that sometimes I was too nice to people.

RK: Absolutely, yeah. That was one of my weaknesses. Being too nice. I try and look after people. I try and please people. And you end up trying to please everyone, and we all know what happens to people who try to please everybody. You come unstuck. I had that in my career.

The bottom line is, I finished at 34 because of the injuries. The guilt is part of being a sportsperson. You play when you shouldn’t, not the other way around. I put my body on the line when really I should have been strong enough to say: ‘I’m not fit today. I’m not fit to train.’ I was constantly pushing myself. And you get criticised for missing games because you were injured. As I say, all the experts are out there.

There is always that element going on when you are in top level sport. Even dealing with managers or players, sometimes I turned a blind eye. I was too nice to them. And then eventually when people trust you and they think they’ve got . . . what’s the word I’m looking for? Eventually they think they can take the mick out of you. Obviously people stab you in the back. People stabbed me right in my chest, it wasn’t in my back. Because I was too nice to them.

BE: Who stabbed you in the chest?

RK: There’s plenty. There’s plenty. Plenty stabbed me right in the chest. People who I thought I trusted throughout my life, whether it be contract stuff, managers. People. That’s what they do. That’s the nature of the game we’re in, with football. I understand that. It’s tough going. You’re battling on the pitch. You’re battling off the pitch, whether it be injuries or contracts [or] the way people are treating you. And sometimes you have to put a front on.

Because of the position I played, in the middle of the park, people were hitting me. I was hitting them. Every time people talk about my career they talk about the people I tackled or hurt, forgetting obviously that I was hurt quite a number of times myself. But that’s the kind of game people play. That’s the deal. It’s give and take. But this idea that you’re working with good people all the time . . . I’ve been very, very lucky. Some of the best people in my life, the majority of people I know, are through football. But I met people as well who I still regret that I got involved with. A number of people. People I trusted.

RK: I’m talking about a number of people. Listen, don’t be putting words in my mouth here. I’m talking about a number of people here and not automatically just United. I have been involved with other clubs. And I have been involved with Ireland. And from a player’s point of view, I have been involved with off-field stuff, whether it be people doing contracts . . . whatever it might be. And there are a number of people who I look back now and go: ‘Shame. Shame on you.’

BE: Was it that much of a shock to you that a big corporation like Manchester United would treat you the way they did in the end?

RK: I didn’t say it was a shock. Where did I say it was shock? I never mentioned United. Put it this way: I’m certainly not the first or the last player to be treated badly by a club. I read that poor Tony Dunne passed away the other day and from what I hear and read, and I know you can’t believe everything, he was very disappointed with the way he was treated. So, again, I’m not the first. It doesn’t keep me awake at night.

BE: Is there anything that does?

RK: At the moment, no. No, no. Sleeping well.

BE: What about Covid-19?

RK: You know, I haven’t been too bad. I know people are suffering and it has been a huge setback. Obviously, I am very lucky. I was supposed to have some work, the usual stuff. I had the Euros coming up. But in terms of dealing with it and being in the house with the family and all, if I’m honest, I’ve enjoyed it. I’||2

This story will update throughout Saturday as the Tulsa World covers President Trump's rally in Tulsa.||1
2020-06-21||Nearly two weeks after Tropical Storm Cristobal forced high waters to move into our state’s coastal areas from lower Terrebonne areas east to Plaquemines, St. Bernard and eastern Orleans parishes, it appears fishing has returned to near normal catches. Then, last weekend’s strong east winds didn’t help.

The bugaboo now is the storm broke up the shrimp pods and made it more difficult for shrimpers to scratch out a living, and it also meant that fishermen aren’t finding the big schools of trout feeding on those shrimp.

That usually happens later in the summer (OK, so summer became official Saturday) after brown shrimp that haven’t been caught move to the coast and begin a westward migration towards Texas.

So, instead of sitting in one spot and hooking enough trout for a big family weekend feast, the best way to continue a morning’s fishing is to consider charting a plan to move from place to place to fill out a limit, whatever that means to an individual angler these days.

When the big piles of shrimp up, trout tend to break up, too. It means you’re not likely to find a motherlode of trout in any spot along a beach, or a cut, or a point or a platform, just because some of the trout that set up home in those places moved to follow the shrimp.

Yes, you can still find live shrimp at the baithouses, and you can find enough speckled trout to make a trip worth your while, but you’ll just have to work and stay out a little longer to do it.

With the black cloud of COVID-19 lingering, it was sad to learn this year’s Fourth of July Golden Meadow-Fourchon Tarpon Rodeo was canceled. Well, organizers said it was postponed until 2021. It joined the annual Swollfest Rodeo on the pandemic’s hit list.

Two other rodeos, Catholic High’s and Jesuit’s, took different approaches.

Jesuit’s annual rodeo begins Friday with weigh-in festivities set to begin at 2 p.m. Saturday (scales close at 4 p.m.) at the school’s John Ryan Stadium in Metairie.

Rodeo chairman Mike McMahon said the rodeo would be held “… in compliance with and subject to any CDC, state, and parish guidelines.”

JHS has five age-group and species-specific divisions, including a Father-Daughter Division, and categories for bass, flounder, black drum and redfish (both with a 16-to-27 inches restriction), speckled trout, redfish, sheepshead and red snapper categories.

For more info, call McMahon (504) 650-1700, or to register call Jeremy Reuther (504) 483-3813/email: reuther@jesuitnola.org.

Catholic High took the summer-long, virtual route to continue its run. After canceling its “live” rodeo in late May, the Alumni Fishing Rodeo crew decided on a “catch-measure-photo” summer-long event through Sept. 7 for its registered anglers.

There are Inshore and Offshore divisions with Youth and Adult “brackets” and largemouth bass has been added to the list including trout, redfish, flounder, blackfin and yellowfin tunas, cobia, wahoo, mangrove snapper, red snapper, grouper and bull dolphin.

Google “Catholic High Alumni Fishing Rodeo” for all rules and registration info.

After rolling up record-setting catches for the first two weekends of the private recreational red snapper season, it appears Tropical Storm Cristobal kept most anglers tied to docks.

After taking near 22% (169,270 pounds) of our state’s 784,332-pound allotment for 2020, the third weekend’s total dropped to 5,523 pounds for a three-week total of 174,793 pounds.

The recreational red snapper season opened in the Sunshine State last week and is scheduled to run through July 25. Florida gets the most of the annual recreational red snapper allotment, a fact that continues to baffle folks fishing in the western Gulf of Mexico.

There’s little debate about the weighty number of red snapper in the western gulf compared to eastern gulf waters, but the “booming” Florida charterboat business is one of the reasons the private recreational anglers had to take a cut from its 49% annual allowable catch (commercial operations get 51%) and turn it over to the federally permitted for-hire/charterboat industry.

That’s why, for western gulf anglers who have to fight off red snapper to catch other species, it’s laughable when Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said, “I’m pleased to announce that our state’s good conservation practices are allowing us to have a 45-day Gulf red snapper season this year. Gulf red snapper season is always an exciting time for anglers and is just another reason why Florida remains the Fishing Capital of the World.”

In the same announcement, you can believe all that “capital of the world” pronouncement, when you understand Florida is battling red tides and Florida’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission had to extend catch-and-release regulations on speckled trout, snook and redfish through May 31, 2021.

If you’ve been around south Louisiana bass fishing for the past 50 years, then you know who Gerald Rome was. He still is for most of us, although the Great Fisherman took our friend earlier this month. His heart just gave out.

Gerald’s finest moment on the water came near two decades ago when he caught a monster largemouth — about 12 pounds — from his beloved Atchafalaya Spilway. His stories could fill this entire sports page, and he will be missed mightily.||1
2020-06-21||The Global Weakness Index: Reading the economy’s vital signs during the COVID-19 crisis

The Global Weakness Index (GWI) is a real-time measure of how weak the global economy is. This column uses GWI to assess the repercussions of the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis in real time. It finds that, after the release of certain soft indicators on 2 March 2020, the GWI increased sharply – much faster than in the 2008 crisis. Moreover, the index remained at a record high at the time of writing, 14 May 2020.

The COVID-19 crisis has once again shown how important it is to be able to assess economic conditions in real time. Although it has been clear since early March that some economies are sliding into recession, until very recently the standard measures – based on low-frequency indicators with publication delays – were silent about the increasing probability of recession in most advanced and emerging economies.

In order to solve this problem, various researchers have developed non-linear models based on several timely indicators. Unlike many other models, the Markov-switching dynamic factor (MSDF) models introduced by Chauvet (1998) have been successfully used to account for co-movements and non-linearities across several economic indicators. These models have widely proven their ability to quickly identify turning points.

In MSDF models, the economy is assumed to switch between expansions and recessions with constant probabilities. Expansions and recessions are respectively characterised by high and low growth rates of the various activity indicators. Conditional on being in each state, the indicators, including GDP, move around these high/low growth rates. Following Hamilton (1989), previous MSDF models have assumed that these two growth rates are the same for all the expansions and recessions in the sample.

This article explains how we (Leiva-Leon et al. 2020) estimate such a model using timely indicators, while also allowing for recessions to differ in depth. To allow for this possibility has two advantages. First, allowing for the mean to vary across recessions is helpful because once an economy has suffered a ‘severe’ recession, such as the Global Crisis, the model might not be able to identify an upcoming ‘mild’ recession. This lack of sensitivity of the model comes from the fact that the estimated growth rate of recessions might be too low to capture ‘mild’ recession periods. Second, as the growth rate of every recession is different, the model delivers real-time estimates of the depth of every recession, which provides valuable information to rapidly design and implement the necessary policy responses. This is especially important in the deep COVID-19 recession that we are currently experiencing.

Data, sample and technical features of the model

An MSDF with recessions of varying depth is estimated independently for twelve of the largest economic regions of the world, which together account for more than 70% of world GDP. Six of them are advanced, while the rest are emerging economies:

We use supply-side variables (usually, industrial production), internal demand variables (imports or sales), external demand (exports) as well as one additional variable, specific to each economy, which is usually a soft indicator such as the PMI. All of these variables are measure at a monthly frequency. In addition, the models contain GDP as a quarterly variable.

The main advantage of relying exclusively on real variables is that we capture all types of recessions, whether they originate in the financial sector, energy prices, a pandemic or any other cause. Whatever is its origin, as long as there is an effect on the economy, the effect will be reflected in these variables.

For every economy, both the probabilities of recessions and the depth of every recession are endogenously estimated. No external dating is used. Figure 1 plots recession probabilities for the different regions on 2 March 2020, the first day in which the model captured a serious increase in global weakness, and on 14 May 2020, the day of the writing of this article.

Note: The heatmap of the world plots the overall pattern of the probabilities of the low economic activity regime for specific dates. The darker (lighter) the area, the higher (lower) the probability of recession. The animated sequence of world heatmaps, from April 2003 until February 2020 can be found here.

The information contained in Figure 1 can be summarised in an index – the Global Weakness Index (GWI). It is a weighted average of the probabilities of recession in different economies. The weights depend on the GDP of each region in every quarter. Figure 2 plots the GWI computed on the same dates shown in Figure 1. As the chart shows, there is a sharp increase as early as 2 March, which is confirmed by the latest numbers of 14 May, where the GWI ends up close to 1. The index can be interpreted as the proportion of the world economy that is currently in recession.

Note: The figure shows the Global Weakness Index, which is constructed as a weighted average of the probabilities of the low economic activity regime across economies. It is weighted by the size of the corresponding economies. The red area represents the credible set based on the 16th and 84th percentiles of the posterior distribution.

Given that the index is computed as a weighted average of the individual economies, it can be broken down by the individual contributors. Each economy’s contribution depends on the weight of that economy in world GDP and the probability of that economy being in a recession. The contribution of the different economic areas can be seen in Figure 3. It shows that, at the beginning of March, only China was clearly in a recession, but recently the US and the Euro area have also been large contributors to the high level of the index.

Note: The radar chart shows the relative contribution of each economy to the GWI. The contributions are normalised to sum up to one.

All in all, the GWI as an indicator has four key benefits. It is

3. Useful for quantifying risks; and

Our model includes GDP as one of its indicators, so it can be used to provide forecasts for GDP. As a matter of fact, computing the probability of negative growth or two quarters of negative growth, i.e. the probability of a recession according to its classical definition, is quite straightforward. In the case of the euro area, the latest figures suggest that the probability of a classical recession has reached 100%.

We present a new indicator of global economic weakness which uses real-time information available to estimate the proportion of the world economy that is in a recession. The indicator is based on the estimation of a dynamic non-linear factor model for individual economies which considers recessions of different depths. In our recent research, Leiva-Leon et al. (2020), we show the excellent real-time forecasting properties of this model for individual economies.

As this article illustrates, the indicator already pointed to clear signs of economic weakness as early as 2 March 2020. This weakness was confirmed by official statistics on 14 May 2020, when Q1 GDP data for most countries were released. Therefore, this indicator helps provide early warnings of a downturn that can be crucial for a fast policy response.

1 Indicators are transformed to be stationary. Depending on the indicators, they are used in growth rates, first differences or levels. GDP is included in growth rates but, given that the model is constructed in monthly frequencies, its relation to the factor is a weighted moving average of monthly activity.

2 This choice follows the original approach of Stock and Watson (1991), Chauvet and Piger (2008) or Camacho et al. (2018). These papers show that such a small set of variables reliably capture current conditions of the economy and comprise most of the information relevant for inferring recessions in real time.

2020-06-21||Thousands of Thai workers to return to Taiwan

The Labour Ministry has approved thousands of labourers to go to work in Taiwan, as the Covid-19 pandemic subsides.

"The ministry made a decision based on the health of workers. Taiwan has not had Covid-19 cases for a long while and it has respected preventive measures," MR Chatu Mongol Sonakul, the minister, told the media yesterday.

In Taiwan, Thai workers face a 14-day state quarantine and will be allowed to work on two-year contracts.

He said many ambassadors had asked Thailand to approve Thai workers to return to work in their countries.

"These countries see Thai labourers as hard-working, honest and strong. The government will make a decision taking into account the workers' health and safety," said the minister.

Suchat Pornchaiwiseskul, director-general of the Department of Employment, said the department plans to export over 50,000 labourers during June to September to Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Israel.

About 20,120 workers will be sent to Taiwan, and 3,818 to Japan.

The department will also send to South Korea 6,412 workers, to Malaysia 2,448 workers, to Singapore 2,934 workers and Israel 2,840 workers.

Meanwhile, there are 128,102 Thai migrant labourers still overseas mostly in Taiwan. The second major group is in the Middle East, mainly Israel, followed by Europe and the African continent, especially in South Africa.||0

The effectiveness of female leaders in handling the COVID crisis has received a lot of media attention. This column examines whether the gender of the national leader truly makes a significant difference to the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the first quarter of the pandemic, with differences in lockdown timing examined as a plausible explanation for these patterns. The findings show that COVID outcomes are systematically better in countries led by women. Insights from behavioural studies and leadership literature are used to speculate on the sources of these differences, as well as on their implications.

On 8 June 2020, New Zealand was declared virus-free and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern lifted all restrictions except stringent border controls (Graham-McLay 2020). With fewer than 500 confirmed cases and seven deaths from the virus, Taiwan under the presidency of Tsai Ing-Wen is seen to have performed very well. Germany under Angela Merkel has done better than most European countries in the first quarter of the COVID pandemic (Hartl et al. 2020). The performance of these female leaders in the COVID pandemic offers a unique global experiment in national crisis management and has given rise to much media attention. This is a significant shift from the male-dominated view of history within which events are typically considered as determined by the instrumental and causal influence of a small number of ‘Great Men’ (e.g. Keegan 2003). But does this association stand up to systematic scrutiny?

Leader’s gender in the fight against the pandemic

In a new paper (Garikipati and Kambhampati 2020), we consider whether there are significant differences in the COVID-outcomes of male and female led-countries in the first quarter of the pandemic. We also consider whether these differences can be explained by differences in policy measures adopted by male and female leaders. In particular, we consider the timing of lockdown in these countries.

Anything said about the pandemic now has to be qualified by the fact that we are only at the start of the pandemic. Much could change in the next few months. Our analysis therefore relates to the immediate reaction of leaders to the first wave of the crisis. Another qualification to keep in mind is the quality of data currently available. In particular, with the shortage of test kits, testing has been poor (Baunez et al. 2020) and therefore case numbers are an underestimate. While data on deaths are more reliable, there are concerns about its comparability across countries. In some countries, if a COVID-positive individual dies, the death is registered as a COVID death irrespective of any other previous illness (such as tuberculosis or cancer). But this is not standard or mandatory, so practice varies across countries.

We begin by looking at some summary statistics. Table 1 presents COVID-19 cases and deaths by gender of the country’s leaders. It confirms that female-led countries have fared better in terms of absolute number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, with male-led countries having nearly double the number of deaths as female-led ones. However, drawing anything conclusive from these raw comparisons is difficult due to the massive underrepresentation of female-led countries in the sample. We have only 19 countries across the world being led by women, compared with the 174 in our sample that are male-led.

Table 1 COVID-19 cases and deaths in countries by gender of national leader

Source: Dataset constructed by authors from various sources.

To overcome the difficulty of imbalanced sample sizes, we ‘match’ each of the female-led countries with their nearest neighbour. We use several socio-demographic and economic characteristics that have been seen as important in the transmission of COVID-19 as matching variables. We begin by considering key demographic and national wealth indicators (including GDP, population over 65 years, and population in urban agglomerations) as these have emerged as the most relevant (Sá 2020). Figure 1 below illustrates some examples of comparing COVID-19 cases and deaths in female-led countries with their near neighbour matched by size of population. When matched like this, it is clear that female-led countries have fewer cases and fewer deaths and have locked down earlier than male countries with respect to cases and deaths. Following discussions in the literature, we also extend matching to include other variables such as expenditure on health and tourism. We also include gender equality as a matching variable as having equitable institutions may contribute to a general resilience that becomes confounded with having a female leader.

Nearest neighbour analysis clearly confirms that when women-led countries are compared to countries similar to them along a range of characteristics, they have performed better, experiencing fewer cases as well as fewer deaths. This is true whether we consider the nearest neighbour, the nearest two, three or even five neighbours. The results are especially highly significant in the case of the number of deaths experienced by female-led countries. These results remain robust when we drop countries that have been in the COVID spotlight – the US, Germany, and New Zealand – from our sample to see if they might be driving the results. We find that these changes in the sample only strengthen the results.

What is also clear from our analysis is that timing of lockdown has been driving the better outcomes in female-led countries. Female-led countries locked down significantly earlier, i.e. when they were seeing fewer deaths (22 fewer) than male-led countries. Our nearest neighbour matching estimates confirm this result at a very high level of significance. While this may have longer-term economic implications, it has certainly helped these countries to save lives (Assenza et al. 2020). Why have women leaders decided to lock down their countries earlier than male leaders?

Figure 1 COVID-19 cases and deaths: Comparing female-led and male-led countries with similar populations

Source: COVID-19 cases and deaths extracted from the Worldometer website (https://www.worldometers.info/)

One explanation for gender-differences in the propensity to lock down early might be found in the literature on attitudes to risk and uncertainty, which suggests that women, even those in leadership roles, appear to be more risk-averse than men (e.g. Croson and Gneezy 2009, Charness and Gneezy 2012). Indeed, in the current crisis, several incidents of risky behaviour by male leaders have been reported. Particularly noteworthy among these are Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro’s dismissal of COVID-19 as “a little flu or a bit of a cold” (Ajzenman et al. 2020) while attending an anti-lockdown protest in April. Similarly, Britain’s Boris Johnson is reported to have said, “I was at a hospital where there were a few coronavirus patients and I shook hands with everybody” (as reported in Lewis 2020).

However, while women leaders were risk averse with regard to lives, they were prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early. Thus, risk aversion may manifest differently in different domains – human life versus economic outcomes – with women leaders being significantly more risk averse in the domain of human life, but more risk taking in the domain of the economy. We find some support for this idea in studies that examine risk taking behaviour when lotteries are framed as losses. Men are found to be more risk averse than women when lotteries are framed as financial losses rather than gains (Schubert et al. 1999, Moore and Eckel 2006). It could well be that the relatively late lockdown decisions by male leaders may reflect male risk aversion to anticipated losses from locking down the economy.

The neuroscience literature also throws light on sex-differences in feelings of empathy which cannot be fully explained as cultural derivatives of socialisation alone but have deeper neurobiological drivers (Eckel and Grossman 2002). There exist quantitative gender differences in the basic networks involved in affective and cognitive forms of empathy, as well as a qualitative divergence between the sexes in how emotional information is integrated to support decision making processes (Christov-Moore et al. 2014). When combined with the findings from the risk literature, we begin to see how women leaders could have been risk-averse about anticipated losses to human life, while at the same time taking risk with negative financial outcomes associated with early lockdown.

Another explanation of gender differences in response to the pandemic is to be found in the leadership literature, where strong evidence can be found to suggest that men and women differ in their leadership styles. Eagly and Johnson (1990), through a meta-analysis of research that compares male and female leadership styles, find that leadership styles were gender stereotypic, with men likely to lead in a ‘task-oriented’ style and women in an ‘interpersonally oriented’ manner. Consistent with this finding, women tended to adopt a more democratic and participative style. Evidence also suggests that good communications skills are important for women to be chosen as leaders and that this is one of the key attributes in managing a crisis (Lemoine et al. 2016).

Indeed, the decisive and clear communication styles adopted by several female leaders have received much praise in the ongoing crisis (e.g. Henley and Roy 2020, McLean 2020, Taub 2020). Thus, in Norway Prime Minister Erna Solberg spoke direct to children answering their questions, while in New Zealand Prime Minster Ardern was praised for the way in which she communicated and for checking in with her citizens through Facebook Live.

Our findings show that COVID-19 outcomes are systematically and significantly better in countries led by women and, to some extent, this may be expla||2

2020-06-21||Ben Lowe and Sam Hartigan were keenly aware of the bit parts they had been assigned in the drama in which their wives, about to give birth, were the stars and both clearly understood what they were missing out on as their partners were led off to the wards to go through the early stages of labour without them.

Covid-19 restrictions in place in the National Maternity Hospital – and other maternity units across the State – have meant that for more than three months some 2,000 fathers have been unable to spend much time with their partners in the lead-up to new arrivals and even less time with their babies once they have come kicking and screaming into the world.

But both of these fathers knew their absence was a price worth paying to keep their babies, their partners and those caring for them safe from harm.

The drama for the Lowes and the Hartigans started early on Monday morning.

“Sorcha’s waters broke so we rushed into hospital, but when got there at around 6am we were told she wasn’t in active labour so she was diverted to an antenatal ward and I was told to go home,” Sam Hartigan recalled.

He returned to their home in Dún Laoghaire, and less than three hours later a call came from a hospital midwife that it was time. “I was back at 9.30am and Eli was born shortly after 2pm.”

Eli is the couple’s first child and while they don’t have anything to compare the birth experience to, Sam is acutely aware things were not normal. “The experience was definitely different to what it would have been pre-Covid,” he said.

“I’d just over an hour with Eli before I had to go. That was tough. I went home and thought I might get some sleep but I just couldn’t, I was buzzing and pacing around. I didn’t know what to do with myself.”

It was the middle of the week when he spoke to The Irish Times and he already had plans for his first Father’s Day.

“I’ve everything ready. The room is all set up and the car seat is locked and loaded. I wish they were home.” Within hours his wish had been granted and the small family unit were together.

The Lowes’ story started in a similar fashion. “We woke up at 5am on Monday and Tracy was having contractions so we raced into Holles Street,” Ben said. “I was allowed to stay to get her checked in but then they said she wasn’t in active labour so I had to leave. We live in Wicklow town and the midwife advised me against going too far.”

So he sat in the car for 30 minutes and exchanged multiple texts with Tracey. “It was very frustrating to not be by her side even though when our son Michael was born seven years ago I did feel a bit useless, like, I’d say, most men do.”

After waiting in the car for a bit he decided to go for a stroll; a long, long stroll. He clocked up thousands of steps over more than four hours walking around the Dublin city centre block. “I just tried to keep my mind off things. I felt like she was in there all on her own even though I knew she was surrounded by these great midwives.”

The couple continued to exchange text messages until 11.30am when Tracey went silent. “I stopped getting messages,” he said. “I think I sent at least four she didn’t respond to and I was convinced then she’d already had the baba. I was terrified the hospital had the wrong number for me and couldn’t reach me. Then I got a call from the midwife, Caroline.

“She was amazing. I happened to be just outside the front door and when I walked into the hospital, I passed five hand sanitiser dispensers and used every one of them. I didn’t take a lift as I was afraid I’d have to touch something and didn’t open any doors with my hands or hold banisters. I was just terrified I’d bring something in with me.”

He wasn’t even in the labour suite for 40 minutes before he was cradling his daughter Eleanor. “We’d a few minutes to ourselves, just the three of us and that was great, amazing, but then around half an hour later they were moved to the ward and I had to say my goodbyes. That was very hard but I’m in no way angry. The procedures are there to keep everyone safe.”

He predicted he would be having a different Father’s Day this year. “My wife will tell you I really milk Father’s Day. It’s nearly father’s month for us and I’d normally be pleading for a lie-in. It won’t be like that this year for sure. There’ll be no lie-ins.”||1

There’s also a look at Murray’s 2019 success with Feliciano Lopez in the men’s doubles, just months after his hip surgery. It might almost make up for the lack of court action at SW19 this year.

Bono’s daughter in a miniseries set in the ’60s? Sounds intriguing. Except that this is the 1860s, and Eve Hewson stars as an emigrant newly arrived in New Zealand in this six-parter based on the 2013 novel by Eleanor Catton. Anna Wetherell is fresh off the boat, but she soon falls under the influence of the scheming Lydia Wells (Eva Green). Himesh Patel, star of the Richard Curtis movie Yesterday, costars as fellow passenger Emery Staines, who takes up with a former convict. A year later, a woman and a Maori man are found unconscious in an opium den, along with a corpse, thus beginning a murder investigation. How did the story get there from here? We trust the gaps will be filled in in most entertaining fashion.

Never mind all that elaborate Love Island and X Factor stuff. All you need is a nice, comfy chair to sit your erudite guest in, and let them do the rest. But not just any old chair – this one is hand-made by Westmeath craftsman Jason Robards. First up in the cathaoir is veteran broadcaster Micheál Ó Muircheartaigh, who reminisces about his long career commentating on GAA matches. He recalls the time he first set foot on the grounds of Croke Park, at the 1948 All-Ireland final, and muses on the many great players he’s met along the way, including Christy Ring and Jack Lynch.

Creating any drama during lockdown has been a challenge for the TV industry, but one beloved series from years gone by seems custom-made for 2020. With some of the best acting talent around, including Jodie Comer, Lesley Manville, Kristin Scott-Thomas and Martin Freeman, now is the chance to see these minimalistic tales revamped for a new generation. In the first of a double bill, Imelda Staunton performs A Lady of Letters, the tale of a woman who compulsively spies on her neighbours. That’s followed by An Ordinary Woman, the story of a mother who finds herself developing incestuous desires for her own 15-year-old son. Sarah Lancashire stars.

2020-06-20||Tiz the Law richly lived up to his favorite's billing, sweeping to victory in the Belmont Stakes on Saturday to launch a topsy-turvy Triple Crown year.

Trained by 82-year-old Barclay Tagg and ridden by Manny Franco, Tiz the Law became the first New York-bred horse to win the Belmont since Forester in 1882.

There was no roar to greet him as he surged across the finish line since the cavernous grandstand at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York, stood empty amid ongoing coronvirus restrictions.

It was the COVID-19 pandemic that saw the Belmont, usually the final race in U.S. flat racing's flagship treble after the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, run first for the first time in history.

The race, long dubbed the Test of the Champion, was also shortened from its usual 1 1/2-mile distance to 1 1/8 -- a nod to the difficulty of getting the 3-year-old contenders in proper condition for the longer distance in the pandemic-disrupted year.

Tiz the Law broke smartly from the eighth post in a field of 10 and settled into third place behind pace-setter Tap It to Win down the backstretch of the sweeping Belmont track known as "Big Sandy."

Franco made his move in the lone turn, surging ahead on the outside and powering home ahead of the Todd Pletcher-trained Dr Post with Irad Ortiz aboard. Max Player, trained by Linda Rice and ridden by Joel Rosario, was third.

The Triple Crown will continue with the Kentucky Derby, usually held on the first Saturday in May, and now rescheduled for September 5 at Churchill Downs. The Preakness at Pimlico, usually the middle jewel of the Triple Crown, is scheduled for October 3.||2
2020-06-20||A major Marvel scheduling clash at Sydney's Fox Studios could push the already-postponed Thor: Love and Thunder film release date even further back, according to Courier Mail.

In March, filming of Shing-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (also a Marvel movie), was forced to a halt when COVID-19 lockdown rules took hold.

As a result, the Chris Hemsworth-led superhero movie will no longer be able to start filming in September as scheduled.

According to the Courier Mail, Marvel distributors Disney are looking to relocate the set interstate, or overseas in a bid to meet it's late 2022 deadline.

'The thing with Marvel films is they have a sequence of films set up for at least the next five years, and all of the storylines are connected,' a source told the publication.

'So they have to keep production and release all on a tight schedule. If one release gets pushed back, then they all go back, and that's when things get messy.'

In April, Daily Mail Australia revealed that pre-production of the film was suspended and all Fox Studios staff were forced to work from home.

'Nothing is being filmed at the moment, our production offices are empty,' they said at the time.

Back in February, it was revealed Marvel Studios took over the entire backlot of the Sydney studios, forcing other local productions, including The Voice Australia and The Masked singer to film at other locations.

The New South Wales Minister for the Arts' office has confirmed Create NSW, which assisted in funding the project, was still waiting on 'decisions from the United States' to make a call about the film.

It's also understood American actress Natalie Portman was due to fly Down Under end of April to begin work on the upcoming blockbuster.

But after the pre-production of the film was suspended, the 39-year-old actress' trip to Sydney was also canned.

Meanwhile, the film's lead actor, Chris Hemsworth has been holed up in his Byron Bay mansion with his family until a decision about the film has been made.||1
2020-06-20||LSU has begun asking a number of football players to self-quarantine in the past week because of instances in which some players tested positive for COVID-19 after social interactions outside of the Tigers’ training facility.

“This is what we anticipated. We planned for this. Our plan is working the way it should,” Senior Associate Athletic Director of Health and Wellness Shelly Mullenix told The Associated Press on Saturday, adding that none of the players have exhibited “significant” symptoms.

“We haven’t seen anything even close to a bad illness, but we’re prepared for that,” Mullenix said. “What we have right now is quite manageable.”

Mullenix declined to specify the number of players who’ve tested positive for COVID-19 or the precise number of those asked to quarantine, stressing that the number is fluid and can fluctuate considerable in short periods of time. But she emphasized that a single positive test could result in as many as 12 to 15 players being asked to initially quarantine because of LSU’s contact tracing procedures. Several media reports have attributing specific numbers to unnamed sources, but Mullenix called those numbers “inaccurate.”

“If our quarantine number is high, it means our players have been communicating not only where they’ve been and who’ve they’ve been with, but also their symptoms, as we instructed them to,” Mullenix said.

Some schools have released figures on COVID-19 testing. On Friday, Clemson said 28 athletes or staff members have tested positive since returning to campus June 8. Last weekend, Louisiana Tech said it had one positive test.

Mullenix said LSU has been working closely with state health officials who would be able to suggest that the football program make changes or even halt workouts at its Baton Rouge, Louisiana, campus if they saw a need for that.

“We’re fortunate in what we’re seeing,” Mullenix said. “If they were to ask us to close down, that would be evidence that we’ve crossed some threshold that’s too difficult to manage.”

LSU players began reporting to the on-campus training facility during the first week in June for antibody testing and physicals.

Strength training and conditioning began the following week with social distancing rules that limited the number of players in the weight room to 20 at a time at regularly sanitized and spaced-apart racks. Each rack contains all weights needed for the day’s workout, so there’s no need for players to cross paths or take turns using the same equipment. The racks are sanitized between each use and LSU also has set up machines like those in hospitals which circulate air through virus-killing ultraviolet light.

Also, players must answer a series of questions and have their temperature scanned before they may enter the facility.

“We’re monitoring it on a daily basis,” Mullenix said. “We’re catching people (with temperature or symptoms) where we want to catch them, right at the entrance, and we’re able to quarantine people before they even get into the facility.”

Mullenix said LSU’s combination of testing for antibodies and active disease, as well as contact tracing, has enabled the university to virtually rule out transmission occurring at on-campus football facilities.

But she noted that LSU always expected at least some players and possibly coaches to contract the virus throughout the year, particularly as they go about their lives outside of football.

“It’s a pandemic; by definition, it would have been foolish to think it wouldn’t happen,” she said, but added, “If these cases are accounted for, then there’s control, which is different than if you had a bunch of cases popping up and had no idea where they were coming from.

“We’ve limited community spread, slowed down spread through the team,” she added. “It’s a slow, controlled burn. The curve is flat and that’s what you want."

LSU, the defending national champion, is scheduled to open the season Sept. 5 against UTSA in Tiger Stadium.

2020-06-20||HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C.—The PGA Tour’s return to competition has brought together the strongest fields of the year on courses that have not been overly punishing, and the result is the same.

It’s another free-for-all at the RBC Heritage.

Webb Simpson practically had to apologize for a 3-under 68, in which he managed just one birdie on the back nine. He was part of a four-way tie for the lead, and that was good enough for him. He also knows good probably won’t cut it Sunday at Harbour Town.

“It’s not like I’ve got a three- or four-shot lead and could shoot a couple under,” he said. “It’s going to take a good one.”

Tyrrell Hatton had one of six rounds at 63, giving the 28-year-old from England a share of the lead as he goes for his second straight victory, albeit three months apart because of the shutdown from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Abraham Ancer, so solid with his irons, had a 65 and joined the lead along with Ryan Palmer, who had a 66.

They were at 15-under 198, a number that didn’t even start to explain the low scoring.

Even with Jordan Spieth and Xander Schauffele sputtering to 75s, the field was 223-under par, the lowest for any round since the RBC Heritage began in 1969. There were 35 players at 10 under or better — including Canadians Corey Conners (-13) and Mackenzie Hughes (-10) — compared with only one player a year ago. The previous mark was seven players at double digits under par through 54 holes.

There were 21 players separated by just three shots going into the final round. A week ago at Colonial, there were 14 players separated by three shots.

“I think the fields have been extremely strong,” Ancer said. “Everybody out here was just eager to come out and play. The greens are a little bit soft, especially this week, and the ball isn’t really rolling out as much as you’re used to on the greens and on the fairways. That’s yielding a little bit more birdies, for sure.”

Carlos Ortiz, who started this tournament with two double bogeys after playing only five holes, suddenly has a chance to grab his first PGA Tour victory after two eagles in a round of 63. He was one shot behind, along with Colonial winner Daniel Berger and Joel Dahmen, both with 63s.

And there was more testing than usual.

Players and caddies on the charter flight to Connecticut for next week’s event had to take a saliva test Saturday for the coronavirus before they can get on the plane. Eleven others had testing Friday night because they were deemed to have been in close contact with Nick Watney, whose positive test on Friday was the first in golf’s return.

Among them was Sergio Garcia, who flew with Watney from Austin, Texas. The initial test was negative. Garcia was nervous as he waited for the result, though not so nervous he couldn’t put down a 65 to join the chase. He was two shots behind, along with Ian Poulter and Joaquin Niemann.

Bryson DeChambeau, starting the day one shot behind, hit his approach into the par-5 second in the trees and it never came down. He has added 40 pounds of mass, still not enough to uproot the tree and shake it loose. That led to a bogey, and more damaging was no birdies on the back nine for a 70.

Even so, he remained three shots behind in a group that included Johnson, who birdied three of his last four holes to go from around the middle of the pack to 12-under 201, three shots behind and very much in the picture. That’s all it took Saturday, and it likely won’t be any different in the final round.

Brooks Koepka quietly posted a 68 and was in the group three shots behind.

Chalk it up to June, a new date for the RBC Heritage because of the pandemic. The tournament usually is the week after the Masters in April, when the temperature is slightly cooler, the greens are firmer and the rye grass hasn’t been taken over by Bermuda. It’s soft. And these are the best players in the world, all of them eager to get going again.

“Because we’re not at a major championship-style golf course last week or this week, where you’re going to have separation because of bad scores, I think that’s probably why,” Simpson said when asked to explain the bunched score.

Perhaps that explains why Justin Thomas called it “the worst 66 I’ve ever shot in my life.”

Hatton has won back-to-back before in his career, under entirely different circumstances. In 2017, he won in Scotland and Italy in consecutive weeks. Now, he goes after two in a row three months apart, having won at Bay Hill in March before the pandemic shut down sports.

It apparently wasn’t long enough for anyone to accumulate much rush.

“I think we’ve all had enough notice to try and get ready to play tournaments again,” said Hatton, who rented a house in Orlando, Fla., during the stay-at-home mandate. “So it’s not massively surprising to see guys playing as well as they are, and hopefully, the guys at home are enjoying it, watching on TV.”||2
2020-06-20||President Trump roared back onto the campaign trail Saturday night with a rally before thousands of supporters in Tulsa, Okla., using the fiery and freewheeling appearance to mock Democratic foe Joe Biden, criticize those tearing down monuments to controversial historical figures and decry what he described as the “disaster” demonstration in Seattle.

The rally, his first in months, comes amid prolonged concerns about the coronavirus pandemic and a nationwide outcry over racial injustice in the wake of George Floyd's death. Before an enthusiastic and placard-waving crowd -- in an arena that still had visible empty seats despite expectations of a packed house -- Trump described his party as one of equality and justice but also hammered a "law and order" message in response to those protests that escalated into violence.

Trump specifically tore into the occupation of several blocks in Seattle by left-wing protesters, which covers an abandoned police precinct, saying it is an example of the "radical left." The occupants, whom Trump described as "anarchists," call their area the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest, or CHOP.

"We're not talking about some little place, we're talking about Seattle," Trump said, criticizing the Democratic officials in Seattle and Washington state. He said he had a standing offer that "any time you want, we'll come in" and straighten out the issues in Seattle "in an hour or less."

But, he said: "I may be wrong, but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster."

Trump added that a congressman on the flight to the rally told him he shouldn't step in to end the CHOP occupation in order to let people see "what radical left Democrats will do to our country."

He also cited "radicals" that targeted statues of Thomas Jefferson and Christopher Columbus in recent days and said that a law should be passed that burning the American flag results in a year in jail. While touting his chances in November, Trump repeatedly used examples of protesters tearing down monuments and the Seattle CHOP zone as a foil for his “law and order” theme -- while insisting Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, would always "cave" to such "radical" parts of his party.

“Do you want to bow before the left-wing mob or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans?” he asked at one point.

The rally's scathing tone, impromptu digressions and political broadsides reflected Trump slipping right back into his campaign element after the pandemic-induced hiatus. Trump also called a Boeing official a “dumb son of a b----,” in describing defense contract negotiations with the company. He said he eventually saved “like a billion six or a billion seven” in the negotiation.

Tulsa marked the president's first rally since early March, when both Trump and Biden canceled in-person campaign events as the seriousness of the coronavirus crisis began to set in. But Trump, who for months has been itching to get the country's economy back to normal and get himself back in front of supporters at his rallies, is the first to resume large in-person events.

Trump also claimed Saturday that the "silent majority is stronger than ever" and touted Republicans as the "party of Abraham Lincoln" and "law and order," in comments appearing to indicate how he will frame his reelection campaign as the November election approaches.

Trump made the declarations at Tulsa's BOK Center -- which itself became an epicenter of controversy amid protests outside and lingering concerns over the potential coronavirus risk of holding the rally.

In advance of the Saturday event, Trump supporters had been lining up for days to secure their seat in an arena that holds just under 20,000, and the Trump campaign touted Monday receiving over 1 million ticket requests.

Nevertheless, there were a number of empty seats on the upper levels inside. The campaign nixed plans for Trump to address an overflow crowd at the beginning. In the arena, Trump accused the media of dissuading would-be participants. Campaign manager Brad Parscale, on Twitter, said, "Radical protestors, fueled by a week of apocalyptic media coverage, interfered with @realDonaldTrump supporters at the rally."

But Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. -- a frequent Trump target during the rally -- tweeted in response that "teens on TikTok" had made "fake ticket reservations & tricked you into believing a million people wanted your white supremacist open mic enough to pack an arena during COVID."

But the rally, despite the hiatus, hit the familiar notes.

Trump early in his remarks touted reform to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the breakneck pace at which the Senate has confirmed his judicial nominees and tax cut legislation he signed into law.

"I stand before you today to declare that the silent majority is stronger than ever before," Trump told the raucous crowd. "Five months from now we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden... We're going to stop the radical left. We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity ... Republicans are the party of liberty, equality and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order."

Like in 2016, Trump promised that he will release a list of names he could potentially choose from for Supreme Court nominees earlier this week, and reiterated the promise Saturday night.

"Think how important it is... It's almost like we're a minority court," Trump said, referencing two rulings that went against the positions his administration took this week.

"I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates" for the Supreme Court, he continued. "And I'll only pick from that list."

Trump said Biden could not release his own Supreme Court list because his possible nominees would be too radical. He also said that Biden would "stack" the tribunal with "extremists."

Additionally, Trump spent a significant amount of time addressing criticism he got for what appeared to be a gingerly walk down a ramp and an awkward sip from a glass of water at a West Point graduation earlier this month. Trump defended himself, alluded that Joe Biden had health issues instead of himself, then took a sip of water to loud cheers from the crowd, before tossing the water out of the glass.

"That's enough, I wanted to tell that story, does everybody understand that story?" the president concluded.

OKLAHOMA SUPREME COURT ALLOWS TRUMP RALLY TO PROCEED AS PLANNED; TULSA MAYOR RESCINDS CURFEW

Trump also targeted China over trade concerns and the coronavirus. He said that his trade efforts helped American farmers and at one point called the coronavirus the "Kung Flu."

Trump also criticized Biden for not agreeing with his decision in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic to close off travel from the country. "He never did anything against China, Joe Biden," Trump said.

The president, in comments on the South Lawn of the White House on Saturday, said he was excited to get back among his supporters.

"The event in Oklahoma is unbelievable," he said. "The crowds are unbelievable, they haven't seen anything like it and we will go there now, we'll give a hopefully good speech, we're gonna see a lot of great people, a lot of great friends and pretty much that's it."

With states reopening after historic economic lockdowns, the rally still raised concerns that it could be a "super spreader" event, especially as six members of the Trump reelection campaign tested positive for the coronavirus ahead of the event.

TRUMP PREPARES FOR FIRST CAMPAIGN RALLY IN MONTHS IN TULSA AMID CONCERNS ABOUT CORONAVIRUS, VIOLENCE

"Per safety protocols, campaign staff are tested for COVID-19 before events," Trump campaign Communications Director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement. "Six members of the advance team tested positive out of hundreds of tests performed, and quarantine procedures were immediately implemented. No COVID-positive staffers or anyone in immediate contact will be at today’s rally or near attendees and elected officials. As previously announced, all rally attendees are given temperature checks before going through security, at which point they are given wristbands, facemasks and hand sanitizer."

The campaign believes the staffers were infected in Dallas at the Trump event there. All six are said to be asymptomatic and the campaign is working with health authorities to contact trace the staffers who tested positive.

Biden in a Saturday evening tweet slammed Trump for holding the rally despite the coronavirus concerns -- Oklahoma has seen a recent bump in cases of the disease.

TULSA ARENA ASKS TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOR WRITTEN COVID-19 MITIGATION PLAN AHEAD OF RALLY

"Donald Trump is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he’s willing to put people at risk and violate CDC guidelines — as long as they sign a waiver promising not to hold his campaign liable. Unbelievable," Biden tweeted.

This followed the BOK Center asking the Trump campaign this week for a written plan on how it would engage in social distancing among the rally-goers. The Trump campaign appeared to dismiss the arena's concerns, making clear that the event would be an on-brand Trump rally.

"We take safety seriously, which is why we’re doing temperature checks for everyone attending, and providing masks and hand sanitizer. This will be a Trump rally, which means a big, boisterous, excited crowd," Murtaugh said in a statement.

The Saturday rally was originally scheduled for Friday, June 19. But that day is the Juneteenth holiday, which celebrates the end of slavery in the United States. Amid racial tensions over the death of George Floyd, the Trump campaign changed the date of the event to Saturday.

2020-06-22||The COVID-19 pandemic is the biggest public-health crisis in a century, and the development of medical interventions to combat the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is a top priority. Writing in Nature, Pinto et al.1 provide evidence needed to take one of the crucial first steps for such efforts in the developing arena of antibody immunotherapy.

Read the paper: Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody

The level of protection provided by the immune system in response to SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection is a hotly debated topic2. It is thought that one major arm of the immune response to such infection is the development of antibodies that recognize the virus. Of particular interest are antibodies that bind to a protein on the viral surface known as the spike protein. Coronaviruses derive their name from their distinctive, crown-like (coronal) viral silhouettes, which are due to these proteins.

Antibodies that recognize and bind to the viral ‘spike’ can block its ability to bind the ACE2 receptor protein on human cells. An interaction between the spike protein and ACE2 is part of a process that can enable coronaviruses to enter human cells. Thus, antibodies that could hinder spike-protein function would block infection; such antibodies are termed neutralizing antibodies.

Much remains to be learnt about the immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, it is becoming clear that antibodies taken from the blood serum of people who have recovered from COVID-19 can be used for treatment by being transfused into other people who have the disease3. Such ‘convalescent sera’ approaches are highly attractive, particularly as an immediate treatment option. That’s because more-conventional therapeutics, such as drugs or vaccines, are unlikely to be available for some time. A more high-tech approach to using convalescent sera is the manipulation of antibody-producing B cells taken from the blood of people who had COVID-19 or other coronavirus infections. Each B cell makes one unique antibody, and clonal populations of a B cell of interest can be used to generate an identical pool of a particular desired antibody known as a monoclonal antibody.

To accelerate the process of therapeutic development, Pinto and colleagues ‘went back in time’, and turned to samples of B cells collected from a person who had been infected by the coronavirus SARS-CoV. This virus, which is similar to SARS-CoV-2, caused an outbreak in 2003 of a disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The hope with such an approach is that the resemblance between the two viruses might mean that some antibodies that recognize SARS-CoV also recognize and neutralize SARS-CoV-2.

The ‘head’, or receptor-binding domain (termed S1), of the spike protein is the most accessible region of the protein for antibodies to bind to. However, this domain exists in different dynamic states, and debate has arisen over whether it is ‘masked’ from the immune system by a shell of carbohydrate molecules4. The identification of a functional antibody that targets this region is therefore not a trivial process. Pinto et al. combined blood cells taken in 2004 and 2013 from a person who had recovered from SARS, and searched for antibodies that could recognize SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1). Of the 25 different monoclonal antibodies that the authors studied, 4 recognized the receptor-binding domains of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. One antibody, termed S309, was selected for further study on the basis of its high-affinity binding to this domain when tested in vitro.

Pinto and colleagues used cryo-electron microscopy to visualize the interaction between the S309 antibody and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This revealed that S309 binds to an accessible site in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein that has an attached carbohydrate molecule. This region is not part of the key area that directly binds to ACE2. The site that S309 recognizes is evolutionarily conserved in spike proteins across a range of bat coronaviruses (in the genus Betacoronavirus lineage B; subgenus Sarbecovirus) that have similarities to the SARS-like coronaviruses. This raises the possibility that such an antibody could have wide applicability in tackling related viruses. Not only, then, is this antibody of interest when investigating ways to manage the COVID-19 pandemic in the years ahead, but it might also be considered for use in preventing future outbreaks of related animal viruses, if they make the leap to causing infection in humans.

Ultimately, it seems unlikely that a robust treatment for COVID-19 will rely on a single antibody. Rather, as was the case for SARS, a synergistic approach combining different monoclonal antibodies in an antibody cocktail might be more effective5. For such approaches to move forwards, evidence of effective antibody neutralization from in vitro studies will be needed, along with in vivo data assessing how well an antibody can boost other aspects of the immune response — by enlisting other immune cells to tackle the infection, for example. There are many promising avenues to explore in these efforts.

Pinto and colleagues got a head start with their work by exploring pre-existing antibodies, and they should now have more B-cell populations to mine. Many other teams, to give just some examples2,6–13, have also presented useful discoveries in the hunt for antibodies that can target SARS-CoV-2. The next steps will be to test individual antibodies and antibody cocktails in animal models, to determine whether they offer protection, and then to assess their safety and effectiveness in human clinical trials. An accelerated path might narrow the time lag between antibody discovery and proof-of-concept trials in humans to as little as five or six months14.

The most recent prominent example of immunotherapy for infectious disease relates to battling the Ebola virus. In concert with vaccines and conventional, small-molecule-drug trials, the development of monoclonal-antibody therapies for Ebola has progressed rapidly. Cocktails of antibodies, beginning with one called ZMapp, that target a key Ebola viral protein called GP in two crucial regions of the protein, are continuing to be developed15–17. This progress in efforts to tackle Ebola gives hope for similar immunotherapy achievements in targeting SARS-CoV-2. Pinto and colleagues’ work marks a major step towards that much-anticipated, and much-needed, success.||2

Wind Tre’s CEO Jeffrey Hedberg says he expects the company to have launched 5G networks in around 10 regional capitals by the end of this year despite market disruption resulting from COVID-19.

 

 According to MondoMobileWeb, Hedberg also said that local authorities in Italy could be doing more to support operators as they deploy new infrastructure, drawing attention to some mayors giving in to pressure from anti-5G protest movements. The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) declared 5G technology safe in March this year.

 

 Wind Tre join rival telcos TIM and Vodafone who have also launched 5G services in Italy.

2020-06-22||At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was hoped that warm weather and younger populations would shield many developing countries from the virus. This hope has not been in realised. Infected cases in Africa, South Asia and Latin America are still growing, with Latin America having surpassed the number of cases in Europe and growing rapidly. This column introduces a new eBook that describes the early work focusing on developing and emerging markets. It concludes that the international community should step up, by providing aid, technical assistance and debt relief so that countries will not need to decide between saving lives and servicing their debts.

The COVID-19 pandemic started in China but soon moved to Europe and to the US, and by the end of March the number of cases in advanced economies had surpassed that in East Asia. At the beginning of the pandemic, it was hoped that warm weather and younger populations would shield many developing countries from the virus. However, this hope has not been in realised. Infected cases in Africa, South Asia and Latin America are still growing, with Latin America having surpassed the number of cases in Europe and still growing rapidly. This is not only due to the fact that many developing and emerging countries are populous. If we focus on cases per inhabitants in countries with a population of at least 5 million, we find that about half of the countries in the list are developing or emerging market economies. And these figures are likely to underestimate the problem as the number of reported cases is closely linked to testing capacity which is limited in many developing and emerging market countries.

Notes: Black: advanced economies (the dashed line excludes the US), Gray: East Asia and Pacific; Dark blue: East Europe and Central Asia; Light blue: Latin America and Caribbean, Green: Middle East and North Africa; Purple: South Asia; Red: Sub-Saharan Africa

The economic impact of the pandemic is global. While in October 2019, the IMF estimated that 2020 world GDP growth would be close to 3.4%, the IMF now forecasts that in 2020 world GDP will contract by 6%. The global contraction affects every country covered by the IMF forecasts. The IMF now expects that in 2020 there will only be 16 countries with positive growth in GDP per capita. For the sake of comparison, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, nearly 80 countries registered positive growth in income per capita.

There is a large rapidly growing literature on the economic effect of COVID-19 in advanced economies (for summaries, see Baldwin and Weder di Mauro 2020a, 2020b and Bénassy-Quéré and Weder di Mauro 2020). Research that focuses on developing and emerging market countries is more limited.

In a new VoxEU eBook, we describe the early work focusing on developing and emerging markets (Djankov and Panizza 2020. Developing and emerging market countries differ from advanced economies in both the structure of the economy and the tools that can be used to implement macroeconomic policies aimed at reducing the amplitude and the economic costs of recession associated with the pandemic (see the chapter by Hevia and Neumeyer). The most important amplifying factors include:
• A large share of informal workers or workers employed in micro-firms
• A small share of jobs that can be done from home

The eBook is divided into five sections. The first three sections frame the problem, present regional perspectives, and discuss how the pandemic affects poverty, inequality and informality. The last two sections discuss policy responses and highlight the macro-financial effects of the crisis, including a narrative on the role of the international financial institutions.

The global economic impact of the pandemic is due to the fact that the economic risk of COVID-19 is distinct from its health risk. The chapter by Noy and co-authors compares these two risks and show that, in some instances, the two might be orthogonal. This is especially the case for countries that have a small number of reported cases but are heavily reliant on tourism receipts and have fairly limited fiscal space for battling the ensuing recession.

Djiofack and co-authors focus on Africa and show that COVID-19 is likely to create a lasting impact on labour productivity. They estimate that, in an optimistic scenario, African GDP would be permanently 1% lower than in the pre-COVID scenario.

Arezki and co-authors focus on the Middle East and North Africa. Unsurprisingly, they show that low oil prices will have a negative effect on oil-exporting countries growth. However, they also show that low oil prices will have a negative effect on oil-importing countries in the Middle East and North Africa because these countries will suffer from reduced foreign direct investment, remittances, tourism, and official assistance.

Levy Yeyati and Valdes show that there is substantial heterogeneity within Latin America, with Peru and Chile able to implement a sizeable fiscal reactions, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay with limited fiscal space and Argentina, Brazil and Ecuador with no access to private capital

Developing Asia is an interesting case because, as shown by Abiad and co-authors, it includes countries with very strict containment measures. Within the region, East Asian economies are expected to observe smaller contractions as these countries have been able to contain domestic outbreaks through aggressive testing and contact tracing, and have avoided stringent containment measures. However, tourism-dependent countries in the Pacific sub-region are expected to observe large drops in GDP even if none of these countries has had a significant outbreak. The chapter by Mooney and Zegarra explicitly focuses on tourism and show that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tourism flows to the Caribbean is without precedent in terms of its speed and severity.

The second section of the eBook starts with a chapter by Gómez and co-authors which uses data from the International Coronavirus Survey. The chapter shows that in low- and middle-income countries, individuals report complying less with the containment measures and express higher levels of worries and depression, with women being more worried and depressed than men. Perceptions are important because divergent beliefs about the ‘facts on the ground’ can be a source of social tension which can ultimately lead to conflict during economic crises. Berman and co-authors focus on conflict and, using a counterfactual exercise, find that that the lockdown has reduce conflict intensity in the short run but that the pandemic may amplify inter-religious and inter-ethnic tension and that violence may explode once mobility restrictions are relaxed.

The chapter by Bosio and co-authors studies how long firms in a sample of 34 low- and lower-middle income economies can survive without revenues. They find that the median firm in a low-income country can survive between 6 weeks and 18 weeks and that in middle-income countries the median survival time ranges between 7 weeks and 11 weeks. This disturbing microeconomic picture leads to two predictions: the potential for massive job losses; and a rapidly growing budget deficit for 2002, 2021, and perhaps some years after that. To address the former topic, Cespedes and co-authors develop a model to show that the elimination of jobs in a pandemic is inefficient because of the interaction of two ingredients: (i) while workers may be unproductive during the pandemic, eliminating jobs harms productivity in the recovery; and (ii) employers may be unable to preserve jobs during the pandemic because of frictions that limit the credit needed for paying the wage bill.

The third section of the eBook focuses on how the pandemic will affect informality, inequality, and poverty.

Valensisi evaluates the effect of COVID-19 on global poverty using three different poverty lines ($1.90/day, $3.20/day and $5.50/day) and finds that the pandemic will erode much of the poverty-reduction gains recorded over the last decade. These estimates focus on changes in GDP and assume that the crisis will not affect income distributions. However, the pandemic is likely to increase income inequality as less-skilled people are often unable to work from home and are either more likely to suffer job loss or have to continue working outside home, with a greater probability of being infected. The chapter by Furceri and co-authors uses data from past epidemic to estimate the effect of COVID-19 on inequality and job prospects. Their findings are in line with the hypothesis that the current pandemic could lead to a large increase in inequality which, in turn, will amplify its effect on poverty.

The chapter by Nonvide evaluates the economic policy responses implemented by selected African countries and shows that these measures often exclude informal workers which, in Africa, account for 86% cent of total employment. She suggests that cash transfer programmes and larger social assistance systems need to be a key component of the policy response in Africa. Dhingra also focuses on informal workers and points out that income policies are hard to implement in developing countries. A universal job guarantee programme is an appealing option for getting people back to work once the acute phase of the pandemic is over.

The chapters in section four of the eBook focus on some of the policy responses in the post-COVID recovery phase. These include job protection (Bircan and co-authors), work from home (Gottlieb and co-authors), the protection of export-oriented firms (Woodruff), the streamlining of bankruptcy procedures (Balloch and co-authors), regulatory reforms to increase firm productivity (Djankov and co-authors), and policies for preserving the human capital of the young (Corral and Gatti). The last chapter of this section by Freund and co-authors discusses the disruption of global value chains brought by COVID-19.

2020-06-22||In addition to stretching outward, the border is also seeping inward. Faced with the challenge of defeating an invisible virus, a growing number of countries are turning to futuristic tracing measures, deploying surveillance tools once used for anti-terrorism and international espionage against their own populations at home. These include measures such as geolocating the cellphones of those who have tested positive for the virus (in some cases, without seeking consent for such tracking); erecting “geo-fences” to draw virtual enclosures around quarantine zones; and activating AI-powered thermal cameras that detect change in a person’s body temperature in order to identify whom in a crowd has a fever (as has been done in Beijing’s Qinghe Railway Station).

Another new possibility is conditioning movement on color-coded QR or numerical scales of individualized “risk assessments” based on big-data-driven algorithms incorporating information on one’s health condition, travel history, and contact tracing. In the United States, Google and Apple will collaborate to use Bluetooth technology to create a new interoperable platform that will permit to “reverse engineer” the movements of the COVID-positive—and those who came in contact with them. Even European countries that adhere to stricter data privacy regulations have warmed to such ideas.

Questions of volitional versus coerced use of such technologies—and their architectures—will have to be debated. The answers may come to serve as a new fault line between democratic and authoritarian regimes. Once put into operation, however, it may prove difficult to return the genie of bio-surveillance back to the bottle, as it provides governments unprecedented technological “see-all” eyes to monitor and track everyone’s mobility everywhere.

Even prior to the current crisis, the European Union funded a pilot project, entitled iBorderCtrl designed to help protect its borders. This monitoring system is designed to prescreen incoming travelers, who are required to “perform a short, automated, non-invasive interview with an avatar [and] undergo a lie detector.” The data is then linked to any pre-existing authority data and stored in large databases that are connected with “portable, wireless connected iBorderCtrl units that can be used inside buses, trains, or any other point [to] verify the identity of each traveler … [and] calculate a cumulative risk factor for each individual.”||0
2020-06-22||The past weeks have been a busy time for Hancock Whitney.

Since the U.S. Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) on April 3, the bank has become one of the largest PPP lenders in Louisiana, funding over 12,000 loans totaling $2.4 billion. Most of the businesses receiving these loans are in Hancock Whitney’s five-state Gulf South footprint.

According to S&P Global Market Intelligence analysis, as of May 6, 2020, Hancock Whitney ranks 17th in the United States for the amount of PPP loans processed and processed more loans than any bank headquartered in either Mississippi or Louisiana.

“The majority of the PPP loans for which we received approval are smaller loans that will help smaller businesses vital to the communities we serve,” said John Hairston, CEO of Hancock Whitney. “It’s an honor for us to help sustain our local economies, and we’re very grateful to businesses that chose us to help them get the funds they needed to keep their doors open and people employed during this pandemic.”

In fact, 67 percent of the Hancock Whitney loans were for less than $100,000, and more than 88 percent were for less than $350,000. This ensures that most money went to smaller businesses in the Gulf South.

Hairston said Hancock Whitney bankers worked around the clock to enter completed applications into the SBA queue, while navigating evolving guidelines and the unprecedented demand.

While clients must determine the content of the applications, Hancock Whitney associates were able to assist them in accessing resources needed to complete applications and gather appropriate documentation.

“They were also very pleased to be able to notify clients when they received SBA approval for PPP loans that help further strengthen community resilience and recovery during the uncertainty of the COVID-19 crisis,” Hairston said.

Beyond helping businesses, Hancock Whitney has also strengthened its commitment to its communities with $2.5 million in investments. Those investments include the following:
• $600,000 for supplies to protect residents in the hardest-hit and low-to-moderate income communities, as well as first responders;
• $800,000 for housing relief, including legal services to help disadvantaged individuals fight illegal evictions; and

In addition, bank board members, executives and associates have contributed approximately $400,000 to help Hancock Whitney associates affected by the pandemic.

“This pandemic is creating real, significant challenges for so many people in terms of adequate food, income, basic safeguards against the virus and housing to shelter in place,” Hairston said. “Hancock Whitney has very deep roots in the communities we serve. It’s simply the right thing to do what we can so that together, we help keep people safe and our communities strong.”

The bank has also worked closely with local restaurants in its footprint to provide nearly 10,000 meals to healthcare professionals caring for COVID-19 patients. Besides serving meals and expressing Hancock Whitney’s gratitude to front line workers, the initiative has helped businesses stay open and pay hundreds of employees.

Although many COVID-19 restrictions are being lifted and people are beginning on a journey to a new sense of normalcy, Hairston said Hancock Whitney’s commitment to its clients and communities will remain steadfast in the months and years ahead.

“Together, we can support each other, invest in our communities, reopen our hometowns, rebuild our businesses and create a better future,” he said.

Hancock Whitney has established a special web page, www.hancockwhitney.com/covid19 with updates on bank locations and operations, resources, fraud prevention tips and ongoing direct assistance for individuals and businesses. The page is updated regularly as information evolves.

Hancock Whitney operates more than 200 bank branches in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida and Texas. For more information, find a location or open an account, visit www.hancockwhitney.com.||2
2020-06-22||Effective State control over the bulk of Ireland’s private hospitals will come to an end in just over a week’s time. The arrangement was broadly welcomed when first announced in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, but has since proven to be a costly and controversial one.

The Cabinet decided in late May not to take up an option to extend the agreement for a further two months, but said it would look at other ways to make use of private hospital capacity in future.

The agreement represented the State’s largest single investment in its effort to manage coronavirus, with the Cabinet hearing that the total cost over three months could be close to €340 million.

Documents published in recent days by the Department of Public Expenditure confirm that the HSE wanted to retain the 2,000 beds, operating theatres and intensive care and other facilities available under the deal.

Official minutes of the Health Budget Oversight Group – a body comprised of officials from the Department of Health, the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure – maintain that the HSE board wrote to Department of Health seeking to extend the arrangement.

The documents show that from early on there were concerns among senior officials about the extent to which the private hospital facilities were being used as the anticipated surge of Covid-19 cases did not materialise.

They state that on April 16th “all parties expressed concern in relation to the utilisation of private hospital capacity”.

“Maximising the use of facilities available to the HSE is of the utmost importance in the current crisis; it was acknowledged, however, that the Government had agreed to the arrangement on the basis that there would be a significant and urgent requirement for additional capacity.

“In this regard, it was confirmed there was activity taking place in the private hospitals and public patients had moved across.”

The Department of Health had written directly to HSE chief executive Paul Reid a week earlier urging that the private capacity be effectively and fully utilised in the interest of patient care and with immediate effect. It said Minister for Health Simon Harris wanted to have specific arrangements put in place to oversee the volume and type of patients seen in the private hospitals and the costs involved.

The minutes say the group on April 24th noted that there “appears to be excess unused capacity in public and private hospital system at present, attributable to both delays in finalising an agreement with private consultants, and to lower-than-projected levels of activity in acute hospitals”.

The group heard that the clinical opinion “indicated a continuing need to retain this level of capacity”. However, the Department of Public Expenditure argued that “data would be needed to support a case for continuing retention of high levels of capacity beyond the minimum period, e.g. in scenarios where the levels of Covid-19 might be effectively suppressed”.

The group heard on April 30th that occupancy of private hospitals at that stage was estimated to be running at 33 per cent “but there is opportunity in May and June to increase usage subject to public health advice and clinical and operational judgement”.

The group was also told that the occupancy rate at the CityWest hotel complex, which the HSE also took over to increase capacity during the pandemic, was “currently low”. Minutes from the following week note “a growing number of questions regarding the occupancy rate of CityWest Hotel at the time, and potential alternative uses for the facility”.

Two weeks later, on May 21st, the HSE told the group that “on balance” it was “inclined toward the view that some level of supplementary private hospital capacity should be maintained and that the continuation of the current arrangement, for some or all of the private hospitals, until end-August would be appropriate”.

The Department of Public Expenditure pointed to “the need for evaluation of alternatives for securing needed capacity; and that differentials in capacity usage between various types of private hospital would be expected to have a bearing upon considerations of value-for-money and upon the final recommendations”.

The Government has separately instructed the HSE to engage with the private hospitals to secure ongoing access to the facilities in collaboration with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to address essential needs including delays in public patients obtaining treatment. These talks are under way and this week the HSE is expected to meet with doctors’ representatives before the Cabinet considers the issue again.||1
2020-06-22||Maura Byrne had to watch from her carer’s mobile phone as a funeral service for her husband of almost 70 years took place.

“It knocked the bottom out of my world,” she says of not being able to attend.

Stephen Byrne (93) died of Covid-19 at St James’s Hospital in Dublin on April 19th. Mrs Byrne (94) was recovering from the disease at St Luke’s Hospital in Rathgar at the time.

“I couldn’t see much,” she says of watching the funeral, held at St Agnes’s Church in Crumlin, on the phone. “There was a young nurse, she was lovely, holding my hand, but I felt I should be with my people. I just didn’t understand it.”

Mrs Byrne entered St James’s Hospital with shingles on February 14th and was transferred to St Luke’s for respite two weeks later. She tested positive for Covid-19 on April 11th and returned to St James’s, where she remained until June 8th.

“I was in hospital for a total of 16 weeks,” she says. “I didn’t know what to do with myself. I must have read about 20 books . . . All I wanted to do was come home.”

Mrs Byrne, originally from Ballsbridge, met her husband, a plumber at the Guinness brewery from Arbour Hill, at a Dublin cycling club and they married on September 5th, 1950. They bought the family home on Dowland Road in Walkinstown and had six children – Máire, Stephen, Bernadette, Deirdre, Paul and Dermot. There are now 17 grandchildren and 15 great grandchildren.

Mr Byrne suffered from dementia later in his life and was cared for by his wife until last year, when he moved to the Croft nursing home in Inchicore. He was brought into St James’s Hospital on April 16th after being diagnosed with Covid-19 and died there three days later.

“I’d ring every night and one of the girls would say he’s fine, as always. Then Máire rang me and said ‘Dad’s not well and he’s in James’s’,” Mrs Bryne recalls.

“I said ‘I’ll go over and see him’. She [Máire] said ‘Mam you can’t, you’re in lockdown you can’t go over to see him.’ So Deirdre and Bernadette were allowed to go in . . . He died the next morning.

“I couldn’t believe it, that I wouldn’t be allowed go [to the funeral]. I maintain I’ve had no closure. A funeral is a closure.

“Yesterday evening Máire and I were looking at photographs and there was a photograph of the coffin in the church and a photograph of the coffin in the crematorium and I felt good after it. I sort of felt weepy but that’s all the finish I’m ever going to get.”

Mrs Byrne says not being able to go to the funeral was very difficult as all she wanted to do was “hold his hand”. The Byrnes plan to arrange a Mass later in the year to remember Stephen that can be attended by all his family and friends.

“He was the kindest and most loving man,” she says. “You always had that feeling that you could depend on him. He never ever let you down . . . Deirdre’s girls were asking me one day ‘how did you know he was the right person?’ I said ‘you just know’.”

As his dementia progressed, Mr Bryne would fail to remember or recognise relatives but Mrs Byrne says “now and again he would say ‘I like you, you’re a nice lady’”.

Since being released from hospital, Mrs Byrne has been cared for at home by Máire and is feeling better with each passing day.

“My health is wonderful. I’m doing a little bit more every day. I can now dress myself. I can put on my shoes, which I couldn’t do,” she says.

“At night I say ‘good night Stephen’ and I say a Hail Mary, because that’s the only prayer he knew,.I say ‘Good night, Stephen’ and then I go to sleep.”||0
2020-06-22||Unmasked! The effect of face masks on the spread of COVID-19

Confronted with a novel, aggressive coronavirus, Germany implemented measures to reduce its spread since March 2020. Requiring people to wear face masks in public places has, however, been a subject of controversy and isolating the effect of mask-wearing on the spread of COVID-19 is not simple. This column looks at the town of Jena and other German regions that introduced face masks before the rest of the country to see whether the requirement makes a difference in the number of new COVID-19 cases. Requiring face masks to be worn decreases the growth rate of COVID-19 cases by about 40% in Germany.

On a global scale, the extent of COVID-related lockdowns is massive, and their socio-economic impact is expected to be far-reaching (Barba Navaretti et al. 2020, McKibbin and Fernando 2020). When it comes to the estimated effects of containment measures, timing seems to matter (Deb et al. 2020).

In Germany, significant actions to reduce the spread of the virus have been taken from mid-March onwards (Hartl et al. 2020). However, the obligation to wear face masks in public has been the subject of controversy and was introduced only relatively late throughout Germany (around 27 April 2020).

At present, virologists are collecting more and more clinical evidence that face masks catch infectious particles produced from speaking, coughing, or sneezing, which may reduce the risk of infecting another person (Prather et al. 2020). Proper wearing of a face mask could thus help to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect risk groups from infections in a cheap and simple way.

Finding out whether face masks indeed reduce the spread of COVID-19 is thus important. Against the available evidence from clinical studies or previous pandemics, we ask: Can we identify a significant effect of face masks on the spread of COVID-19 by looking at the development of registered COVID-19 cases? Yes, we can. We zoom in on the case of Jena, a town of 110,000 inhabitants in the federal state of Thuringia, Germany.

Jena presents a unique case in Germany (see also Mitze et al. 2020), as the obligation to wear face masks in public transport, shops, and workplaces was introduced much earlier there (on 6 April) than in all other regions in Germany (around 27 April). The introduction of obligatory face masks was accompanied by a public campaign “Jena zeigt Maske” (“Jena shows mask”), which started one week earlier to make the local population aware of this novel measure.

We can observe differences in the timing of introducing face masks across German regions due to the institutional setup of the German federal system: according to the German Infection Protection Act, federal states are in charge of formulating and prescribing public health measures to fight the spread of infections. Local municipalities and health authorities then decide on the implementation of specific measures, e.g. the timing of their introduction. And Jena was the first to act.

If we look at the number of COVID-19 cases in Jena, masks seem to have a positive effect. The number of registered new infections fell to almost zero in the days after masks were introduced. But was this really due to the introduction of masks and a publicly visible campaign? Unfortunately, there is no second Jena in Germany, which would allow us to measure the spread of COVID-19 if face masks had not been introduced under otherwise identical conditions.

Our solution is to apply the synthetic control method (Abadie and Gardeazabal 2003, Abadie et al. 2010, Abadie 2020) to construct a counterfactual that closely follows the COVID-19 trend in Jena before masks were introduced. The idea is to construct a weighted average of similar regions in Germany (with no mask obligations) at the time when mask-wearing became compulsory in Jena.

Regions and their respective sample weights are chosen based on the cumulative number and changes in newly registered COVID-19 cases before 6 April, together with structural regional characteristics such as regional population density, average age of the population, proportion of senior citizens, and average number of doctors and pharmacies per inhabitants. In the baseline, both West and East German cities such as Rostock, Darmstadt, and Trier constitute this synthetic Jena (see Mitze et al. 2020 for the full list).

We then use this counterfactual to estimate the hypothetical change in cases in Jena after 6 April. This tells us approximately what would have happened if no masks had been introduced in the city.

Table 1 shows a significant difference in the number of cases in Jena and the comparison group without masks after 6 April. Twenty days after the introduction of mandatory masks in Jena, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases increased from ‘only’ 142 to 158. In the synthetic Jena, the number rose from 143 to 205. This corresponds to a reduction in the number of cases by around 23%.

Notes: The sample of all municipal districts in Germany covers 401 regions; the subsample of cities covers 105 larger cities (kreisfreie Städte). For details, see Mitze et al. (2020).

We find that the difference is most striking for the over-60 age group. For this group, the increase in cumulative cases in Jena decreased by more than 50% compared to its synthetic control group (see Mitze et al. 2020 for details).

Panel A in Figure 1 shows that the effect gradually appears over time. However, its gradual emergence after about 3-4 days is too fast from an epidemiological point of view. With COVID-19’S average incubation period of approximately 5 days and a potential reporting delay of 2 or 3 days for laboratory results (Donsimoni et al. 2020), effects on reported new cases should only be seen after 7 or 8 days. An announcement effect may have played a role in Jena.

In panel B, we therefore start our analysis on 30 March, the day the mask campaign was announced. In this case, we observe a widening gap between Jena and the comparison group after about 10 days. Taken together, this effect appears to be plausible and is found to be robust when confronted with different sensitivity tests (see Mitze et al. 2020 for details).

Figure 1 Treatment effects of face masks in Jena over time

Still, can we draw conclusions for other regions or even other countries from a single case when we cannot completely rule out that Jena is special because of unobserved factors? We therefore go beyond a single case study and examine all those regions that had introduced masks before or by 22 April. Besides Jena, these include regions that required masks before the state-wide requirement was introduced (Nordhausen in Thuringia, Rottweil in Baden-Württemberg, the Main-Kinzig district in Hesse, and Wolfsburg in Lower Saxony), as well as all regions in Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt. We compare these regions with the majority of German regions that only introduced masks on 27 April or later. The main advantage is that we can calculate an average effect over different regions, although this comes at the expense of differences in the timing of introduction, which are smaller.

We find smaller effects than in the Jena case study (Table 1). However, the average reduction in case numbers compared to their synthetic counterparts remains significant and sizable. Depending on the chosen sample, 10 days after the introduction of masks, the decrease in the cumulative cases is between 2.3 and 4.2%. Generally, the effect is larger for the subsample of larger cities (kreisfreie Städte).

Based on our findings, we calculate a rule-of-thumb measure for the relative decrease in the daily growth rate of COVID-19 cases of about 40% (Table 1). Consider a region in which the number of COVID-19 cases increased by 10% from one day to another. This increase would have been only 6% if there had been an obligation to wear face masks. With a 10% daily increase in COVID-19, cases double within 7 days; in contrast, a 6% daily increase means cases double only within 12 days.

In summary, the introduction of mandatory face masks has slowed down the spread of COVID-19 in Germany. This result agrees with the findings of epidemiologists and virologists who explain that face coverings limit airflow when speaking, thereby reducing the transmission of infectious particles.

The observed effect in Jena is larger than the average effect for other regions with face-mask requirements. Two mechanisms may explain this difference: first, with Jena being a pioneer city in Germany when it comes to the introduction of face masks, the local population may have taken the crisis more seriously than in other regions, causing a sort of Hawthorne effect. In other words, the population may have taken the introduction of masks as a strong signal to follow contact restrictions closely. Another likely reason is that anticipation effects have increased over time in Germany: people in other regions may have chosen to wear masks even before wearing them became mandatory.

In sum, our results suggest that requiring masks is a cost-effective, less economically harmful, and democracy-compatible containment measure for COVID-19.

2020-06-23||One day after Wanheng Menayothin announced his retirement, promoter Piyarat Vachirarattanawong insisted on Monday the undefeated world champion has yet to hang up his gloves.

The WBC minimumweight champion, known in Thailand as Wanheng CPF, announced on his Facebook page on Sunday that he was retiring for health reasons.

He said he had thought thoroughly before making the decision.

"Nobody knows my body better than myself," he wrote. "Everybody wants money but I prefer protecting my body. So I am quitting boxing."

In his previous bout, the 34-year-old boxer, whose real name is Chayaphon Moonsri, scored a unanimous decision over South Africa's Simphiwe Khonco in Chon Buri last October.

Piyarat said he had a talk with him on Monday.

"I talked to him on the phone and he admitted he did it because of stress during the Covid-19 pandemic," he said.

Wanheng was scheduled to defend his title against the Philippines' Marco Rementizo in California last month.

But the match, which would be Wanheng's first outside his country, was postponed indefinitely because of the coronavirus outbreak.

His handlers have signed a five-bout contract with US-based Golden Boy Promotions for Wanheng to fight in America.

Piyarat said he wanted to arrange a warm-up fight for Wanheng but he could not bring in a foreign boxer due to travel restrictions.

Also, fighting against a fellow Thai would be improper, he said.

Piyarat said he planned for Wanheng to return to the ring in September.

Wanheng admitted he made the announcement without consulting anyone.

He said he would have a check-up and let the doctor decide if he could continue fighting.

Menayothin boxing gym chief Chaisit Kongkiatkong said the champion had complained he had a breathing problem during training.

"I can't prevent him from quitting. Everything is up to him," said Chaisit, who is also his personal manager.

Wanheng took the crown from Mexico's Oswaldo Novoa with a ninth-round stoppage in November 2014.

Since then, he has won 18 consecutive bouts, including 12 title defences.

Wanheng is the longest-reigning active world champion with an unblemished record of 54 wins, with 18 knockouts.

He is currently one of Thailand's only two world champions with the other being WBA minimumweight title-holder Knockout CPF.||1
2020-06-23||Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference is completely online this year, but that doesn’t mean the company held back on its announcements. Since there was no live audience to interrupt the keynote with applause, hoots, and hollers, Apple covered a ton of ground at a brisk pace during its two-hour presentation on Monday. You can watch the keynote in its entirety online, but if you don’t have the time, you can find out what happened in our summary right here.

It’s been rumored for a while, but Apple’s announcement that it will switch from Intel processors to its own silicon was the final segment of the keynote, saving the biggest news for last. Apple CEO Tim Cook said that Apple has planned for a two-year transition, with the first ARM-based Mac coming later this year.

Apple has a kit available for third-party software developers to create software that can natively run on ARM-based Macs. The company also revealed Rosetta2, technology that will allow users to run software originally created for Intel-based Macs.

We have the complete details on Apple’s transition to its own ARM processors.

Usually, the Mac is a short section of the WWDC keynote. This year, it’s front and center, thanks mostly to the ARM switch. But there are also big changes coming to macOS this year. The next version of macOS is called Big Sur, and it’s officially version 11.

If you felt like macOS was started to look a little tired, you’re in for a treat with Big Sur. It features a revamped user interface, with reworked menus, app sidebars, and app icons. Notification Center has improved functionality, and Control Center—a main UI element for iPhones and iPads—is now available on the Mac.

Apple used its Mac Catalyst technology to convert the iOS versions of Maps and Message to new Mac versions. And Safari has a slew of new features, including improved speed, start page customizations, improved support for Extensions, and new privacy features.

Learn more about the new features of macOS Big Sur.

This is the iOS update that longtime iPhone uses have been aching for, mostly because it has a feature that’s long overdue: A new Home screen. Apps can be automatically grouped together in a screen called the App Library. You can add widgets to your Home screen for quick access to the information you need.

Siri gets some updates, with a new interface and new incorporation in a Translate app that can translate written and spoken words in real time. Translate works completely on the device to maintain your privacy.

Apple has brought the iPad’s picture-in-picture feature over to iOS. If you’re watching a video or making a FaceTime call, the video screen will be in a persistent box, regardless of the app you are using.

Get the details on iOS 14’s new features.

Last year, Apple introduced iPadOS, a version of iOS that’s designed for use on Apple’s tablet. With version 14, iPadOS continues to evolve with features specific to the iPad.

Apple is changing the design language of the iPadOS so that app can take better advantage of the platform. Apps will stop looking like iOS versions that were brought over to the iPad. You’ll see better implementations of sidebars, toolbars, and menus.

iPadOS 14 has improved Apple Pencil support, specifically for handwritten text. Apple is bringing over its Scribble handwriting recognition engine, so you can write in apps as well as input fields, and the iPad will be able to recognize it.

Many of the new features in iOS 14 are coming to iPadOS, such as the revamped Siri interface, App Clips, and redesigned widgets. However, iPadOS is not getting the App Library feature.

The next version of the Apple Watch operating system has some major new features. The main new feature is sleep tracking. It can track how much sleep you get, and also has a “wind down” function.

In this time of the COVID-19 pandemic, Apple has created a new feature to help you wash your hands. It can sense when you’re doing so, and start a 20-scoend time to make sure you wash properly.

Other new watchOS 7 features include the ability to share watch faces with others, a new Dance workout, and an enhanced Noise app to help protect your hearing.

Here are the 5 ways watchOS 7 will supercharge your Apple Watch this fall.

The smart home is an ever-growing market for Apple, and the company made several improvements to the Home app and the underlying HokmeKit technology. Among the features introduced were:
• The ability to create tracking zones for security cameras

Find out more about the new features of HomeKit.

And so much more

These are the major talking points of Apple’s keynote. Check out our continuing coverage of WWDC for more details about all of Apple’s announcements, and check back often as we preview all the fine details of iOS 14, iPadOS 14, macOS 11 Big Sur, watchOS 7, and more.||2
2020-06-23||NZD/USD trades in a narrow range ahead of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) interest rate decision on June 24, but the exchange rate may struggle to retain the advance from the start of the month as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) threatens the upward trend carried over from March.

NZD/USD bounces back ahead of last week’s low (0.6381) as the RBNZ is expected to keep the official cash rate (OCR) at the record low of 0.25%, and the central bank may tame speculation for additional monetary support after expanding the Large Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) programin May to NZ$60 billion from NZ$33 billion.

The RBNZ may soften the dovish forward guidance for monetary as the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) largely anticipates the economic slowdown from COVID-19 to be “followed by a strong rebound,” and hopes for a V-shape recovery may encourage the central bank to retain the current policy in the second half of 2020 as Governor Adrian Orr and Co. “expect to see retail interest rates decline further as lower wholesale borrowing costs are passed through to retail customers.”

In turn, it remains to be seen if the RBNZ will prepare New Zealand households and businesses for a negative interest rate policy (NIRP) as Chief Economist Yuong Ha reveals that “we’ve given the banking system until the end of the year to get ready so that the option is there for the Monetary Policy Committee in a year’s time,” and the central bank may largely rely on its balance sheet to support the economy as the NZIER’s Shadow Board reveals that “opponents of a negative OCR consider QE (quantitative easing), as a support to stimulatory fiscal policy, to be a more effective way to support economic activity.”

A material adjust in the RBNZ’s forward guidance may spark a bullish reaction in the New Zealand Dollar if the central bank tames speculation for additional monetary support, but more of the same from Governor Orr and Co. may undermine the recent rebound in NZD/USD as the“Committee agreed that it will stand ready to deploy further tools as needed, should the need for stimulus continue to increase.”

With that said, bets for a NIRP in New Zealand may drag on NZD/USD as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell tames bets for negative US interest rates, and recent price action warns of a potential shift in market behavior as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) falls back from overbought territory and threatens the bullish formation from March.

• None Keep in mind, NZD/USD has failed to retain the range from the second half of 2019 as the decline from earlier this year produced a break of the October low (0.6204), with a ‘death cross’ taking shape in March as the 50-Day SMA (0.6197) crossed below the 200-Day SMA (0.6319).
• None Nevertheless, NZD/USD managed to push above the February high (0.6503) earlier this month as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) broke above 70 for the first time in 2020, but recent developments in the indicator highlight a potential shift in market behavior as the oscillator falls back from overbought territory and threatens trendline support.
• None In turn, the advance from the March low (0.5469) may continue unravel amid the lack of momentum to push above the Fibonacci overlap around 0.6600 (38.2% expansion) to 0.6630 (78.6% expansion), but recent price action warns of range bound conditions as NZD/USD bounces back ahead of last week’s low (0.6381).
• None Need a break/close below the 0.6400 (61.8% retracement) to 0.6430 (78.6% expansion) region to bring the 0.6370 (50% retracement) region on the radar, with the next area of interest comes in around 0.6310 (100% expansion) to 0.6320 (23.6% expansion), which lines up with the 200-Day SMA (0.6319).

Coming from three continents, we are united by our passions for space — as an engineer, a scientist and an astronaut. We are crew members of Planet Earth and friends for life. As such, we appreciate the power of a holistic vision of our world.

Since astronauts first shared their space-based views of Earth and its thin, fragile atmosphere, we have felt a responsibility to protect the planet. Many of those pioneer astronauts became environmentalists, advocates for international cooperation and sustainable development, and world-peace envoys. As space exploration moved into the Apollo era and beyond, we discovered that thousands of exoplanet systems could exist. Some might even host intelligent life. More people will come to share these new world views as space tourism takes off.

We call for a global effort to end the pandemic and to then shape the world into a better place for international cooperation and sustainable development.||2
2020-06-23||Strategies for passive and active immunization to combat and prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection should take into account the pathogenesis of COVID-19, which can lead to death. The inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 is thought to drive or at least exacerbate the disease process, particularly during the second week after infection becomes symptomatic. How may these immune responses that modulate pathogenesis be affected by NAbs?

The lethal coronaviruses cause fatal acute lung injury (ALI) by driving hypercytokinemia and aggressive inflammation through incompletely understood mechanisms. In macaque models of SARS-CoV-1 infection and passive or active immunization, IgG specific for the S-protein was reported to exacerbate ALI by counteracting inflammation-resolving responses, abrogating wound-healing, promoting monocyte chemoattractant peptide-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) production, and increasing proinflammatory monocyte and macrophage recruitment (Liu et al., 2019). Likewise, in human patients who died of SARS-CoV-1 infection, pulmonary proinflammatory macrophages accumulated in the lungs, whereas wound-healing macrophages were absent (Liu et al., 2019). Moreover, two observations noted above raise questions about the causal relationship between antibodies and severity of infection: NAb responses were faster in the patients who later died than in those who recovered (Zhang et al., 2006; Ho et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2019), and older patients who had recovered from mild COVID-19, had significantly stronger NAb and S-protein-binding antibody responses than younger ones, whereas higher age is a major risk factor for lethal COVID-19 (Wu et al., 2020).

In vitro, sera from subsequently deceased patients enhanced SARS-CoV-1 induced MCP-1 and IL-8 production by human monocyte–derived wound-healing macrophages, whereas blockade of the FcγR receptor reduced these effects (Liu et al., 2019). One must be prudent when extrapolating from a macaque model of SARS-CoV-1 infection to human COVID-19 patients, but the antibody response to these lethal coronaviruses might play a role in disease progression, perhaps by formation of immune complexes, and by promoting macrophage infiltration and sustained inflammation. We hypothesize that there may be a causal link between seroconversion and the rapid deterioration that can take place in the second week after the first symptoms, but this remains to be established.

Other reports suggest that anti-S and other CoV-specific antibodies have pathogenic effects in animal models. Thus, multiple CoV vaccines were associated with an increase in eosinophilic proinflammatory pulmonary responses upon challenge of the immunized animals (Bolles et al., 2011; Honda-Okubo et al., 2015; Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2014). Previous SARS-CoV-1 infection limited virus replication in African green monkeys but not lung inflammation, when the animals were re-challenged with the same virus (Clay et al., 2012). It has not been determined which factors, such as viral dose and the extent of the innate and adaptive immune responses, yield these problematic effects. A particularly important knowledge gap is whether certain specificities and other properties of antibodies are responsible.

Pre-existing serum antibodies against influenza antigens were consistently associated with severe illness in patients during the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic (To et al., 2012; Monsalvo et al., 2011). Of note is that those antibodies did not neutralize influenza virus (To et al., 2012) and that immune complex formation was implicated as a pathogenic trigger (Monsalvo et al., 2011). Whether these observations are linked to the findings reported by Liu et al. remains to be seen (Liu et al., 2019).||2

In a bid to speed up the roll-out of ultra-fast broadband across Italy, the Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Monday that the state might consider raising its stake in TIM, the former phone monopoly. The Italian government believes that building an ultra-fast broadband network will be key to reviving and boosting the economy after the damaging impact of COVID-19.

The government has called on TIM and its rival Open Fiber to reach a rapid agreement to create a single network in a bid to avoid duplicating investments which could prove costly. Open Fiber, who operates a wholesale-only network, is jointly owned by Enel and state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP). CDP is also TIM’s second largest shareholder, owning a 10% stake, with France’s Vivendi owning 25%.

Despite ongoing talks, TIM and Open Fiber have just to reach an agreement over merging their network assets due to differences over governance and regulation, among other issues.

According to Reuters, the founder of the senior coalition party 5-Star Movement, Beppe Grillo published a blogpost calling on CDP to increase its stake in TIM to approximately 25% thereby equalling Vivendi’s holding.

The COVID-19 shock has ended the eight-year long US housing market expansion. At the same time, the Federal Reserve and the US Government have deployed significant resources to help weather the ongoing crisis. But the trajectory of the post-COVID-19 recovery remains uncertain. Using a time-varying parameter model, this column suggests that the next US housing recovery may exhibit similar features to the 2012-19 expansion: a sluggish response of housebuilding to rising demand, but a strong response of house prices.

The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted an immediate response from economists and policymakers in an attempt to design appropriate policies to tackle the ongoing health and economic crisis (Baldwin and Weder di Mauro 2020a, 2020b). While it is highly uncertain how the post-COVID-19 recovery will evolve, in this column we look at past US housing expansions to help us shed light on the possible trajectory of the next housing recovery.

Housing is a very different asset from any other financial asset, such as equities or bonds. The homeowner owns not only the dwelling itself but also the land on which it sits on. Housing can also be seen as a consumption good, in the sense that the owner consumes the housing services of living there. Moreover, housing is of particular interest for economists and policymakers alike.
• First, housing is the main asset for the majority of households – over 65% of US households own a home, while only around 24% own directly stocks and bonds, according to the Survey of Consumer Finances. In addition, the distribution of housing assets is less skewed towards the richest, which contrasts with financial assets – households in the bottom 80% of the income distribution hold roughly 43% of total real estate wealth in the economy, but only 11% of total stocks and bonds.1
• Second, real estate accounts for a substantial fraction of economic activity, with private residential investment accounting for 4% of GDP, and housing consumption accounting for 20% of total private consumption expenditures.2
• Third, recent research has found that the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of housing wealth is much larger than that out of financial wealth (Carroll et al. 2011).

The prominent role of housing in the economy has generated a lot of interest in how shocks to demand affect house prices and the real economy more generally. For instance, an expansion in monetary policy can stimulate housing demand via lower borrowing costs – households typically finance housing with mortgage debt (DeFusco and Paciorek 2017). Apart from this credit channel, monetary policy can also influence housing demand through the collateral or refinancing channel, whereby easier monetary conditions and higher house prices lead to higher home equity. This additional equity allows households to increase borrowing to finance consumption (Aladangady 2017, Beraja et al. 2019, Bhutta and Keys 2016, Iacoviello 2005).

Housebuilding in the recent recovery had been remarkably different from past episodes

House prices in the US had been increasing at a strong pace in the years before the pandemic shock struck. But despite the strong expansion in house prices, housebuilding activity had been relatively weak compared to the strong housing boom over 1996-2006 (Aastveit et al. 2020).

To place the dynamics of the housing market and economic activity into historical perspective, we compare real house prices, building permits, and real GDP across the past four housing expansions. We use the Harding-Pagan (2002) algorithm to identify turning points in real house price cycles since the mid-1970s. We identify four housing expansions: 1975 M9–1979 M7, 1982 M11–1989 M3, 1996 M12–2006 M4, and 2012 M3–2019 M12. These cycles are broadly in line with the housing literature (Glaeser et al. 2008). We scale real GDP and house prices to be 100 at the beginning of each housing expansion, so that we can easily compare the dynamics across indicators. We show building permits as a percentage of the housing stock at the beginning of each cycle. To smooth out strong fluctuations in the monthly data, we show quarterly data in Figure 1.

The pace of house price appreciation displays a broadly similar pattern across housing expansions, with the exception of the 1982-89 period (Figure 1). The recent recovery that started in early-2012, and that may have possibly ended in early-2020, is particularly similar to the one in the run-up to the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). By contrast, housebuilding activity, as illustrated by the number of building permits approved for construction, stands out in the 2012-19 expansion: the flow of permits averaged 0.9% of the initial housing stock in 2012, which compares with an average of around 1.6%-2.0% during the previous expansions. Aastveit et al. (2020) have found that the sluggish pace of housebuilding is linked to a decline in supply elasticities, which in turn is likely related to the tightening in land-use regulation over the past decades (Herkenhoff et al. 2018, Hsieh and Moretti, 2019). Declining supply elasticities imply that an increase in housing demand may be absorbed more by house prices. Finally, while the GDP dynamics have been relatively similar across the first three housing expansions, the economic performance during the most recent recovery has been subdued. In the light of these changes in the housing market, we ask whether the transmission of housing demand to the housing market has changed over time. We use monetary policy shocks as a proxy for shifts in housing demand to investigate this question.

Notes: Real GDP and real house prices are scaled to be 100 at the beginning of each housing expansion. Building permits refers to its flow as % of the housing stock at the beginning of each expansion. The horizontal axis shows quarters around the beginning of each expansion, and the vertical line at zero is the starting point.

We apply a flexible time-varying parameter (TVP) vector autoregressive (VAR) model that is largely data-driven in modelling changes in the dynamic relationship between variables (Cogley and Sargent 2001, Primiceri 2005). We estimate the TVP-VAR model over 1991 M1–2019 M6 using seven variables: (1) monthly GDP from Macroeconomic Advisers, (2) the CPI, (3) the policy rate measured by the Wu and Xia (2016) shadow rate to account for the zero lower bound, (4) building permits, (5) house prices, (6) the Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012) spread, and (7) bank credit. A model with these variables produces dynamic responses that are supported by standard macroeconomic theory. We use state-of-the-art high-frequency monetary policy shocks obtained from market surprises on intra-daily data on Fed future contracts following monetary policy announcements (Paul 2020).

A monetary policy shock that decreases the policy rate stimulates housing demand and therefore raises output, building permits, and house prices (Figure 2). But while the response of GDP seems to be overall constant over time, the responses of house prices and permits exhibit substantial time variation. In particular, house prices have become more responsive since the GFC, reaching levels similar to those during the pre-crisis period. In contrast, although the response of permits has recovered after the GFC, it remains well-below historical averages.

Figure 2 Responses to an expansionary monetary policy shock over time

Notes: The figure shows the cumulative median time-varying responses of real house prices, building permits, and real GDP to an expansionary monetary policy shock that decreases the policy rate by 25 bp.

We investigate this time variation further by looking at the relative responses between permits and house prices for one and three years after a monetary policy shock. These relative responses allow us to gain insights into the dynamic relationship between permits and house prices; the percentage change in permits for each percentage point change in house prices. The relationship between permits and house prices seems rather stable since the early-1990s and until the GFC. After the GFC, we find evidence of a substantial decline in the relative response of permits for a given percentage change in house prices: a drop of around 15% in the relative response after one year, and of around 20% in the relative response after three years (upper panel of Figure 3). This finding is consistent with the notion that construction has been reacting less to changes in demand, i.e. that US housing supply elasticities have declined (Aastveit et al. 2020).

We also look at the relative percentage increase in GDP for each percentage increase in house prices, akin to the concept of a sacrifice ratio (Ball 1994). We find that the transmission of monetary policy to real activity relative to house prices has weakened since around 2013. Our estimates show that an expansionary monetary policy shock in 2019 M6 raised house prices relatively more than output. The experience around the GFC stands in stark contrast. This was a period when the measures adopted by the Federal Reserve to fight the crisis seemed to have supported economic activity more relative to house prices (bottom panel of Figure 3). One possible interpretation of our results is that a shock to housing demand that is increasingly absorbed by house prices, rather than supply, may contribute less to overall economic output. This point relates to recent research arguing that the low interest rate environment in the aftermath of the GFC may have rendered monetary policy less effective for economic activity (Berger et al. 2020, Eichenbaum et al. 2018).

COVID-19 and the related lockdowns have taken their toll on the EU corporate sector. This column uses an accounting approach and ORBIS firm-level data to assess the medium-term strategic choices for firms. Assuming three months of lockdown and under different normalisation scenarios, cumulative net revenue losses of EU companies are estimated in the range of 13-24% of EU GDP. These losses create a difficult trade-off for firms between protecting investments and increasing their leverage. To properly accompany the recovery, policies to ease access to credit should be matched to enhanced instruments for long-term, equity-type financing.

Covid-19 and the related lockdown have taken their toll on the EU corporate sector. A sudden drop in revenues and only partly adjustable costs have led to a fast depletion of firms’ cash buffers, even in the context of strong policy intervention.Several studies have shown a large share of firms facing liquidity shortfalls during 2020 (Banerjee et al. 2020, OECD 2020, Demmou et al. 2020, and EC 2020). In a first exercise (EIB 2020a), using an accounting approach, we estimate that even after strong policy intervention, 51%-58% of EU firms face liquidity shortfalls after three months of lockdown (Table 1).

Table 1 Liquidity shortfall of non-financial corporations under various scenarios and across time (EU)

Note: Based on EU27. The columns "Share" indicates the proportion of corporates that do not have enough cash to withstand their payment obligations over the period, as percent of the population (1st column) and of value added (2nd column).

With expectation of a U-shaped recovery, we extend this exercise to assess the possible medium-term strategic choices for firms. We use a comprehensive dataset of more than 1.3 million non-financial corporates located in the EU, accounting for around €3 trillion of assets in the final sample. We present four alternative scenarios, to account for (1) strength of the immediate policy support and (2) length of the normalisation period. The impact of the crisis is illustrated by adjusting each component of net revenues symmetrically for all firms. Under each scenario, we account for the change in corporate activity using the calibrations presented in Table 2.

We compute the cumulative net revenue loss for each individual firm. The median reduction in net revenues could range between 5% and 10% of total assets across the four scenarios (Figure 1). SMEs will suffer a reduction between 6% and 11% of assets. Larger corporates would be significantly less impacted, from 2% to 4% of assets. Weighting the estimates by size reduces the overall decline in net revenues to 4% to 8% of total assets, a loss between €1.9 trillion and €3.4 trillion, or from 13% to 24% of EU GDP.

Figure 1 Net revenues reduction associated to various scenarios (median, % of total assets)

Figure 2 Filling the gap: Impact on investment and indebtedness (% of GDP, EU economy)

Notes: Results under the benign scenario (heightened policy support and 3 months normalisation period)

We focus on the most benign scenario (heightened policy support and three months normalisation) and consider a simplified accounting identity to illustrate the impact of lower revenues on the main balance sheet components. The simplified identity assumes that all earnings are retained. Net revenues finance the accumulation of cash and liquid assets, real investment, and debt reduction. Hence, in this framework, lower net revenues can result in reduced cash balance, increased indebtedness, and lower investment.

Cash buffers can absorb a small part of the reduction in net revenues, especially as EU corporates entered the crisis with sizeable cash positions. During the lockdown period, these positions have decreased, but after the crisis it is unlikely that most firms will fully restore their cash positions. We estimate that during the Lehman and sovereign debt crises, cash positions were reduced by 2% of GDP. According to current forecasts, during the Covid-19 crisis, output will be reduced by up to twice as much than during the financial crises. Moreover, given the current very low interest rate environment, the return on cash and liquid assets is almost nil. Hence, we assume that following the Covid-19 crisis, cash positions will absorb 3% of GDP of the loss in net revenues.

EU corporate investment shrinks by 31% to 52% while corporate indebtedness rises by 4% to 6% of GDP (Figure 2). According to the EIB Investment Survey, two-thirds of EU corporate investment is financed internally. Hence, after drawing on cash positions, around two-thirds of the losses in net revenues (which, after drawing on cash positions represent 10% of GDP) would be absorbed by lower investment, a reduction of 7% of GDP, equivalent to a decline of 52% in corporate investment. Debt would also contribute to fill up the gap, rising by around 4% of GDP. Alternatively, corporations could increase their access to external finance. Assuming that the whole sample of firms tap external finance (even those that do not do so in normal times), the share of external financing would rise from one-third to 60% of total financing. Investment would then be reduced by 4% of GDP (a fall of 31% compared to the level in 2019) but indebtedness would increase by 6% of GDP. The fall in corporate investment would be around twice that recorded during the financial crisis, when corporate investment fell by 19%. This is in line with forecasts that project a much higher impact on GDP, and with the EC findings of a cumulative drop in private investment of €831 billion in 2020 and 2021 taken together (see EC 2020).

Policymakers have acted swiftly, pledging support and stepping up measures to support corporates as developments have unfolded. Wage subsidies, tax deferrals, and loan payment moratoria have been alleviating the cash flow problems of firms. All member states have implemented some form of tax forbearance or some form of wage subsidy. However, these programmes are limited in time, scope, and scale.

Central banks, supervisory authorities, and governments have deployed specific measures to maintain the credit channel. Announcements on targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO) and easing on collateral requirements have secured banks’ access to long-term credit through the crisis. Supervision authorities have provided early indications to banks to use capital and liquidity buffers through the crisis, as well as guidance on provisioning through the cycle. This has been complemented by the widespread use of national credit guarantee schemes, and at the EU-level, the set-up of exceptional financing facilities, such as the Pan-European Guarantee Fund.

While preserving access to credit is key in the short term, absorbing more debt poses problems for a sizeable part of the corporate sector in the medium term, due to leverage constraints. A considerable number of European firms are likely to reach excessive levels of financial leverage as the COVID-19 crisis unfolds. As a consequence, a large share of EU firms could start the recovery period with deleveraging pressures. This in turn would have negative consequences on these companies’ ability to carry out investment plans.

Publicly funded equity-type instruments complement loans and guarantees to alleviate the excess leverage problem. The increase in corporate leverage due to the COVID-19 crisis can be limited by the use of equity-type instruments which absorb any losses but also share in any future profits. However, it is not easy to find effective equity instruments, especially for SMEs whose owners are often reluctant to allow external ownership (for a creative proposal see Boot et al. 2020). Equity-type instruments are an integral part of the EU recovery plan. The EIB has long experience as an anchor to both the EU venture capital and venture debt markets. Moreover, equity-type instruments are envisaged in the Next Generation EU package through the new Solvency Support Instrument (SSI).

Public support to the corporate sector inevitably raises the question of moral hazard and might include a push towards some long-term policy goals. Measures need to be designed carefully. Support measures that restrict direct benefits for existing creditors, e.g. including limiting dividend payments, can contribute to mitigate moral hazard issues. Temporary measures and built-in sunset clauses can help to avoid permanent distortions. In addition, increasingly targeting support and devising measures with ‘smart conditionality’ – linking support to steps that improve firms’ longer-term resilience, such as the adoption of new business processes or digitalisation – can be a way to preserve activity and also strengthen firms’ perspectives going forward.

The emergence of a trade-off between leverage and investment suggest some optimal sequencing in terms of policy response. While at the inception of the crisis, deferrals and grace periods play a role in preventing firms’ liquidity shortfalls, those measures are temporary by nature. Measures to support access to credit, including guarantee schemes, follow, but create risk of over-leveraging. To properly accompany the recovery, policies to ease access to credit should be matched with enhanced instruments for long-term equity-type financing. As public support to the private sector always raises the question of moral hazard, transparency and incentive compatibility will be crucial to prevent it. Going beyond the immediate liquidity needs of the corporate sector, long-term, equity-type instruments should be considered to avoid excessive corporate leverage and to preserve financial stability.

2020-06-23||Preserving capital in the financial sector to weather the storm

On 27 May, the ESRB General Board adopted a wide-ranging recommendation to suspend pay-outs across different segments of the European financial system until the end of 2020. This column discusses why arguments for such restrictions weigh stronger than ownership and management rights during these unprecedented times. It provides a rationale for why the recommendation is a wide-ranging one, including banks, investment firms, insurance companies and CCPs and referring to all voluntary pay-outs, including dividends, share buy-backs and variable remuneration to material risk-takers.

Unlike the Global Financial Crisis, the current crisis did not start in the financial sector. As most sectors in the economy, however, the financial sector will be negatively affected by the crisis, through loan and income losses (Mann 2020, Perotti 2020). At the same time, the financial sector is central in efforts to mitigate the crisis and speed up the recovery (Beck 2020). Specifically, banks can play a key role in maintaining liquidity support for firms during the lockdown phase, as has become obvious from the drawdown of credit lines over the past months (Acharya and Steffen 2020). Banks play an important role as a conduit for fiscal support measures for firms and households and serve as a critical transmission channel for monetary policy. Central counterparties (CCPs) support hedging activities by financial market participants, more important than ever in these highly uncertain times.

Given this important role and the risks to which the financial sector is exposed, governments and regulators across the globe have taken decisive actions early on, including providing capital relief, liquidity support and loan guarantees (Baldwin and Weder di Maruro 2020).1 These actions seek to limit losses and encourage the financial sector to keep supporting the real economy. The goal of maintaining sufficient levels of capital and loss-absorbing capacity is also the reason why regulators across Europe have encouraged banks and insurance corporations to refrain from voluntary pay-outs (e.g. dividends, bonuses and share buybacks aimed at remunerating shareholders).

On 27 May, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) decided to reinforce and complement these recommendations with a broader recommendation.2 Compared to previous recommendations, the ESRB covers a larger array of financial institutions, including banks, investment firms, insurance companies and CCPs. Unlike previous recommendations, the ESRB refers to all voluntary pay-outs that have the effect of reducing the quality or quantity of own funds, including dividends, share buy-backs and variable remuneration to material risk-takers (staff members whose professional activities have material impact on the institutions' risk profile) and thus goes beyond previous recommendations. And unlike some recommendations issued by other European regulators, the recommended restrictions apply until the end of 2020. They can also be extended further.

While such restrictions intervene in ownership and management rights, there are strong arguments for them in times of crisis.
• Banks constitute a critical sector for economic recovery, so there is a need to maintain a sufficiently high capitalisation. There are good reasons why such a decision cannot be left to shareholders themselves: the direct effect of pay-outs on the resolvability of banks, the severe externalities in the event of a bank’s failure, and the fiscal and other measures put in place by authorities during the COVID-19 crisis which limit losses for banks’ shareholders and could encourage more risk-taking than optimal from society’s viewpoint.
• With governments using various means to support companies during the lockdown, shareholders and senior management should not shift capital allocation for the benefit of their own personal wealth. In the case of banks, regulators have provided significant capital relief (€120 billion for significant institutions under direct ECB supervision), which would be partly offset by pay-outs.
• Mitigating procyclicality. Banks behave in a procyclical manner in their lending. During recessions and times of crisis, banks show a propensity to build reserves against credit losses and reduce lending, with this reduction in lending being caused by an increase in information asymmetries between borrowers and lenders and a reduction in collateral values (e.g. Bernanke et al. 1999). Other sources of procyclical behaviour are accounting standards (Laeven and Majnoni 2003) and capital regulation requiring higher risk weights (Brei and Gambacorta 2016). High capital buffers can partly mitigate this tendency towards deleveraging. This in turn suggests that pay-outs should be suspended so as not to offset the effect of using these capital buffers.
• Avoiding stigma and a race to the bottom: If banks use dividend payments as a signal of strength to the market, then any bank not paying dividends will fear being stigmatised. This is another argument in favour of coordinated and mandatory action to restrict pay-outs (Bernanke 2009).
• Charities, foundations, pension funds and retail investors often depend on steady dividend income. While in a complete market shareholders would be able to sell their shares and thus receive equivalent income, this is a suboptimal strategy in the current volatile times.
• The prohibition of pay-outs could limit resource reallocation that might be needed during the recovery stage. This represents an argument in favour of limiting the period for which restrictions are applied.
• Banning dividend payments may undermine the relationship between a bank and its investors. This could potentially restrict the bank’s future access to market funding. Capital instruments subject to the restrictions might become less attractive to investors, particularly compared with instruments of entities in jurisdictions that do not impose such restrictions. In turn, this could reduce the ability of the affected banks to raise additional capital, or it could increase their cost of capital. This represents another argument in favour of limiting the period for which a restriction on pay-outs is in place.

To assess the impact of system-wide restrictions on dividends, we considered the stock market reaction on Monday 30 March 2020 to the ECB recommendation published on Friday 27 March 2020 addressed only to significant institutions directly under the supervision of the ECB. Their share prices suffered only a limited additional fall (of around 80 basis points) compared with the fall in the share prices of European banks not supervised by the ECB, although effects on individual institutions varied. Larger banks tended to be more affected by the dividend restrictions. Stock prices of euro area global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) dropped by 280 basis points more than the stock prices of non-euro area G-SIIs. Banks’ own announcements also seem to have had an impact on their stock prices. Over a relatively short time frame (one day), large banks that announced dividend cancellations tended to underperform the broader banking index (EURO STOXX Banks) by between 161 and 539 basis points. The greater impact of individual bank announcements clearly points to the stigma effect outlined above. This would suggest a need for coordinated action rather than relying on individual bank initiatives.

While the above arguments relate primarily to banks, (re-)insurers are also likely to suffer losses from the COVID-19 crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant losses in financial markets, including steep falls in stock markets, across-the-board spread widening and swap-rate tightening. COVID-19 could be seen as a ‘triple-hit’ scenario, combining market shocks in the form of an increase in risk premia and a decrease in the risk-free rate affecting both sides of insurers’ balance sheets and additional insurance-specific shocks. Given the important role of insurance and reinsurance companies in financial markets (European insurance companies hold around €10 trillion in assets), and the expected severity of the financial crisis following the COVID-19 pandemic, which is potentially comparable to stress test scenarios applied in recent European stress tests, it is important to maintain own funds and capital buffers to safeguard the resilience of the insurance sector. In light of these concerns, the ESRB decided to include (re-)insurers in its recommendation on restricting pay-outs.

CCPs now play a key role in clearing financial market transactions and are a major segment of the financial sector. It is therefore important that they maintain adequate prefunded own resources in addition to initial margins and default funds. As in the case of banks and (re)insurance companies, investor rights have to be weighed against financial stability concerns. In addition, it is important to note that while CCPs are not directly involved in real-sector funding, their critical role in financial market transactions means that banks and insurance companies rely on them for their hedging activities.

The recommendation calls for restrictions on the consolidated level, but on the sub-consolidated level if the parent bank is outside the EU. Ideally there would be cooperation on the global level. As this has not happened, the ESRB saw the need to primarily take care of the European financial system. Therefore, the recommendation primarily targets pay-out restrictions at the EU consolidated level. One tricky issue has been restrictions at the sub-consolidated and individual level within the EU, several Central and Eastern European countries already having imposed restrictions on subsidiaries of EU cross-border banks for financial stability concerns.

There are strong arguments on either side. On the one hand, regulatory risk-sharing is incomplete in the EU (including within the eur||2
2020-06-24||Today the European Commission’s independent Group of Chief Scientific Advisors (GCSA), the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) and Peter Piot, special advisor to the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, published a joint statement on scientific advice to European policy makers concerning the COVID-19 pandemic.

President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen said:

Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, Mariya Gabriel said:

The statement provides guidance for the provision of scientific advice in pandemic situations that are characterised by complexity and uncertainty. To ensure efficient and effective policies, advice should be multi-disciplinary, and provided through early and frequent exchange with policy-makers. Transparency and openness are crucial. Clarity on what is known, what is not known, and what cannot be known is very important as illustrated by debate around the use of facemasks, the ability of children to spread the disease, or the maximum level of protection offered by a possible vaccine. Also critical is that there is a clear distinction between advice, decision making and implementation roles.

The statement also announces two forthcoming jointly authored scientific opinions that will make recommendations for better pandemic preparedness and management and on crisis resilience in general.

The statement draws on the principles described by the GCSA Opinion “Scientific Advice to European Policy in a Complex World” (September 2019) and the EGE Statement “European Solidarity and Protection of Fundamental Rights in the COVID-19 Pandemic” (April 2020).

The European Commission’s Group of Chief Scientific Advisors (GCSA) contribute to the quality of EU legislation through the provision of independent scientific advice to the Commission. The Advisors are seven eminent scientists, appointed in their personal capacities and who advise the Members of the European Commission on issues of public interest. The Advisors work closely with the Scientific Advice for Policy by European Academies (SAPEA) consortium, which gathers interdisciplinary expertise from over 100 academies and societies across Europe. A summary of the Advisors’ previous publications and their impact can be found in their February 2020 report, ‘Informing European Commission Policy Making with Scientific Evidence’.

On the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies

The European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) is an independent, multi-disciplinary body appointed by the President of the European Commission. The EGE advises on all aspects of Commission policies and legislation where ethical, societal and fundamental rights dimensions intersect with the development of science and new technologies. The latest statement was issued on 2 April 2020, on European Solidarity and the Protection of Fundamental Rights in the COVID-19 Pandemic.

The special advisor to the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, on the response to the coronavirus and COVID-19

Virologist Prof Peter Piot is special advisor to the President Ursula Von der Leyen on the response to the coronavirus and COVID-19. In this role, he advises the Commission in supporting and steering research and innovation in the global fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and Handa Professor of Global Health, co-discovered the Ebola virus in Zaire in 1976 and also led pioneering research on HIV-AIDS, women’s health and infectious diseases, mostly in Africa. He later directed the United Nations AIDS programme for ten years. The former Under Secretary-General of the UN is also member of the scientific advisory panel that provides the Commission with recommendations on response to the pandemic; including policy measures for addressing its long-term consequences.||2
2020-06-24||A new parent group has organized to put pressure on school districts to embrace anti-racist curriculum and instruction. Its first action, which begins today, aims to inundate 10 school districts, from California to Connecticut, with emails demanding change.

Racial Equity Education is small: About 10 friends, all Black, white, Jewish or Asian parents of K-12 students, and connected through Facebook, put the group together earlier this month.

But it has big dreams. It wants students, parents, and community members to pile so many emails in the inboxes of key district leaders in 10 cities that they'll have to sit up and take notice.

"If you're hearing tens of thousands of folks singing the same song, in chorus, saying the time for change is now, it's harder to ignore" than one petition that lands on a leader's desk, said Gigi, who works in adult education in Seattle and is one of the group's founders.

Gigi and the group's other members insist that their last names be withheld for their safety. Where they live, in Milwaukee, Boston, Buffalo, N.Y., Seattle and other cities, they've already seen violence and verbal abuse toward demonstrators protesting police shootings. And they've had a couple of hateful comments posted in their Facebook group, Gigi said. (The group moderators have since deleted them.) 



Getting the Message Out

In its first wave of activism, Racial Equity Education is targeting the Seattle, Highline, and Puyallup districts in Washington state; East Baton Rouge, La.; Buffalo, N.Y.; Frederick County, Md.; Newtown, Conn.; and three districts in California: Oakland Unified, Glendale, and Placentia-Yorba Linda.

Racial Equity Education chose those 10 districts because it knew there were already students or community members lobbying for anti-racist curriculum there, so they could build on those efforts, Gigi said. The group included East Baton Rouge, La., because of a video that went viral, showing activist Gary Chambers Jr., accusing a local school board member of shopping online while he made an impassioned plea for the board to rename a high school that's named after Confederate General Robert E. Lee.

The new group's playbook is twofold: It will send demand letters to school board members, PTA presidents, and local teachers' unions in 10 districts. But it's also posted links to a letter template and sample emails that people can use to lobby these—or any other—school districts.

Their two-page letter demands that schools include "Black experience, voices and history" in their curricula. It argues for a well-rounded K-12 ethnic studies curriculum, citing a 2011 paper by the National Education Association that argues that students of all races and ethnic backgrounds benefit from such study. And it asks board members and other leaders to engage in discussions about anti-bias training for teachers, ways to hire more Black and brown teachers, and other changes related to racial equity.

In many of the 10 districts that are the focus of Racial Equity's new campaign, students are already circulating petitions demanding that their districts do a better job of building a curriculum that includes examination of systemic racism.

Laura Durante is one of those students. A brand-new graduate of Middletown High School South, in Middletown, N.J., the 18-year-old and a friend started an online petition to ask their district to commit to expand the lens through which it teaches history to include more study of Black, indigenous and LGBTQ people.

"To continue to teach in a manner that blatantly ignores the histories and cultures of both Black and Indigenous people and their oppression is doing the next generation of leaders a grand disservice," the letter says.

It's gathered more than 800 signatures since it was posted on June 13, Durante said. Five days later, District Superintendent William O. George III responded with a public letter of his own, offering further conversation. "We must ask ourselves if we can do better," he wrote.

Durante said she started the petition drive because she feels she missed important learning in her predominantly white school system.

"We get this starry, white-washed, colonialist version of history," she said. "Both world and European history are taught through the eyes of white settlers, and that's a very narrow view of how things are."

Seeing the pileup of signatures, and the district's response, makes Durante feel hopeful. "I haven't usually felt I've had a voice [in school decisions], but this letter showed me that maybe this is something we can change."

Activists who work with school districts on instruction about civics and race report that they're seeing an uptick of interest in anti-bias training and anti-racist teaching.

Jill Bass, the chief education officer at the Mikva Challenge, a national organization that helps teachers learn to plan "action civics" projects that engage students in the community, said she's "getting a lot of calls" from teachers and district administrators about how those projects dovetail with anti-racist curriculum.

She's also seeing administrators feeling readier than they were last year to take the risk to jump into controversial subject matter, Bass said. "If the desire was there before, now there's a huge fan on that fire, giving it oxygen," she said.

Trudy Delhey sees that change from her post as the K-12 social studies supervisor for the Cobb County school district in Georgia. Teachers are increasingly asking for help with culturally responsive teaching, she said. And her district is moving full-force into training on an updated Mikva Challenge curriculum that dives deeply into how power and privilege shape social identity, she said.

"We're maxing out with it, and we weren't ready for that before," Delhey said. "COVID and [concerns about] policing have exposed the inequities people experience. There's this instant understanding that's translated into teachers being more reflective about what they have to do to better serve students."

Gigi homeschools her two children because, as an Afro-Latina, she found the "Eurocentric curriculum" in the local schools unacceptable, and "harmful to the self-esteem of Black and brown children," she said. (Seattle, where she lives, is working on a K-12 ethnic studies curriculum.)



She hand-picked a list of resources for teachers that highlight the historic and cultural contributions of Black people. But it's a short list, and her group recommends that districts work with consultants to build out a full curriculum.

2020-06-24||What do recoveries from past US recessions teach us about the recovery from the pandemic recession?

The global COVID-19 pandemic has led to job loss of catastrophic proportions in the United States. This column looks at recoveries from recessions over past 70 years to assess how the US labour market might recover from this job loss of unprecedented magnitude. Remarkably consistent recoveries have occurred in the US after every recessionary shock that caused a spike in unemployment, and there are reasons to believe that the recovery from the current shock will be more rapid, because unemployment contains a much larger fraction of workers on temporary layoff than in previous recoveries. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty about the possible recovery rate.

The global pandemic has led to job loss of catastrophic proportions in the United States. From February to April of this year, employment fell by 21 million, or more than 13%. In May, a small recovery occurred, and observers are reasonably confident that the recovery will continue, at least until a possible second round of the pandemic occurs. How will the labour market recover from job loss of such an unprecedented magnitude? We have been studying data from the labour market during recoveries from past recessions, along with the most recent data from the current recovery, to address this important question.

The business cycle involves variations in aggregate slack, and the best measure of slack is the unemployment rate (Romer and Romer 2019). A well-documented property of the unemployment rate – most recently confirmed by Dupraz et al. (2019) – is that unemployment rises rapidly in response to a significant aggregate adverse shock and then gradually recovers, until the next recessionary shock hits, or the unemployment rate reaches about 3.5% of the labour force.

In a recent paper (Hall and Kudlyak 2020), we study data from the labour market during recoveries from the recessions over past 70 years. It is a remarkable fact about the historical US business cycle that, after unemployment reached its peak in a recession and a recovery began, the annual reduction in the unemployment rate was stable at around 0.85 percentage points per year. The economy seems to have had an irresistible force toward restoring full employment.

Figure 1 depicts the change of the unemployment rate for individual recoveries, in percentage points. The blue bar shows the annual rate of decline in percentage points of unemployment and the red bar shows the total percentage-point decline during the recovery. The height of the blue bars was lower than earlier for the recoveries beginning in 1992 and 2003, but the annual rate was second highest of all recoveries in the recovery that just ended; and the total recovery from 2010 to 2020 was the greatest over the 70-year history. The uniformity of the annual rates of recovery in this figure is striking.

Figure 1 Average annual rates of decline in unemployment in percentage points, by recovery, and total decline during each recovery

Figure 2 shows the unemployment rate with the recession spells left blank. Our two observations about recoveries are apparent in the data: unemployment declines smoothly but slowly throughout most recoveries most of the time; and unemployment declines along a straight line, not one that curves upward. The actual path is close to linear.

Figure 2 The paths of unemployment during recoveries

Spike in job loss in recessions does not fully account for subsequent lingering unemployment

We document substantial but short-lived spikes of job loss in recessions using four measures of job loss: (1) layoffs from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, which represent employer-initiated termination of a worker without prejudice, typically because continuing employment has become unprofitable; (2) job destruction in the Business Dynamics Statistics data, which is defined as the sum of all establishment-level reductions in employment (Davis et al. 2013); (3) worker displacement from the Current Population Survey (CPS) Displaced Worker Supplement, which measures job loss among workers with at least three years of tenure at the lost job; and (4) unemployment insurance claims.

We then examine the relationship between the magnitude of the increase in unemployment following a recession shock and the measures of job loss. We conclude, from data on displaced workers collected every two years in the CPS, that the number of workers displaced even in the severe recession starting in 2007 was not enough to explain the volume of excess unemployment present in the US economy during the period from 2009 through 2014. Something happened in the labour market during that period that caused elevated unemployment among workers who were not displaced around 2009.

Figure 3 shows that the spike in layoffs more than fully accounts for the spike in unemployment in 2009 but cannot account for all of the excess unemployment afterwards. That is, the excess job loss accounts for the magnitude of the initial increase in unemployment, but not its persistence. The persistence is too large to be explained as reflecting only the personal experiences of the extra job-losers dating from the spike. The direct channel is only part of the story of persistent high unemployment after the crisis.

Figure 3 Unemployment from excess job loss in 2009 and total excess unemployment, by four measures of job loss (in thousands of workers)

We examine the puzzles of low recovery speed and linear recovery paths in the framework of the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides (DMP) model. Our view of the labour market has points in common with Pries (2004) and can be seen as responding to the challenge of Cole and Rogerson (1999) to explain how aggregate unemployment recovers much more slowly than does an individual spell of unemployment.

A typical recession shock permanently destroys firm-worker relationships. The ensuing reemployment process involves multiple short-term employment spells before the unemployed find new permanent jobs. We calculate the effective exit rate from unemployment, which is lower than the individual exit rate from unemployment spells from one month to the next. Those individual exits are frequently temporary departures from the labour force or short-term jobs, and are then followed by additional spells of unemployment, as described in an earlier paper of ours (Hall and Kudlyak 2019).

We believe our findings are relevant for the recovery that is expected to follow the deep recession triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, but we do not try to predict how the recovery will evolve. In particular, our work should not be interpreted as a forecast that unemployment will decline as slowly in the coming recovery as it has in past recoveries. Our work is complementary to that of Gregory et al. (2020) in this respect.

A major difference between the current and past recessions is that the overwhelming majority of currently unemployed workers anticipate being recalled to jobs from which they have been temporarily laid off, within the coming six months (Kudlyak and Wolcott 2020). We perceive two polar outcomes resulting from the unusual preponderance of workers on temporary layoff.

In the best outcome, their expectations about recall are fulfilled. They return to their existing jobs rapidly without sacrificing their job-specific human capital (Fujita and Moscarini 2017). Only a small fraction of the large number of people laid off from the pandemic actually enter traditional unemployment. Their unemployment declines at around one percentage point per year, but that results in the correction of the relatively small bulge of non-temporary-layoff unemployment over only a few years.

In the worst outcome, the majority of workers currently on temporary layoff fail to be recalled and therefore become unemployed in the traditional sense. They undergo the same time-consuming process of searching for work, taking short-term jobs, and experiencing spells out of the labour market, that we have described in our work on the slow recovery of unemployment after the recessions from 1948 through 2009. The implications of this outcome are alarming: The US unemployment rate is currently about 14%, say 9 percentage points above normal. It would take 11 years (9 divided by 0.85) to work off the pandemic’s bulge of unemployment as it currently stands.

The coming months will teach us a lot about where the US economy stands between these two polar outcomes. Most observers believe that unemployment will decline in coming months by at least one percentage point per month, or at an annual rate of 12 percentage points per year, far above the historical recovery rate. One study, by Barrero et al. (2020), is pessimistic about the likelihood of successful recalls for a large fraction of those currently on temporary layoff. On the other hand, in the Current Population Survey, between April and May, only a small fraction of those on temporary layoff reported a change to traditional unemployment. Petrosky-Nadeau and Valetta (2020) investigate a number of differences between unemployment dynamics in the pandemic recession and prior recessions.

Our research concludes that the economy has a strong internal force toward recovery. Remarkably consistent recoveries have occurred in the US after every recessionary shock that caused a spike in unemployment. We make the case that the internal force originates in the labour market. Historically, the force has delivered only modest annual declines of unemployment. We have reasons to believe that the recovery from the pandemic shock will be more rapid, because unemployment contains a much larger fraction of workers on temporary layoff than in previous recoveries. But there is a great deal of uncertainty about the forthcoming recovery rate.

• None Hang Seng Index extends rally as tech gains. It faces an immediate resistance at 25,000
• None Singapore’s PM announced a general election to be held on 10
• None are extending gains to US$ 1767

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index stock market benchmark surged 1.6% yesterday, marking it one of the best performing indices across the Asia-Pacific region. The rally was mainly driven by technology giant Tencent (+4.89%), which accounts for around 11.2% of the index’s weight (table below). Financial stocks AIA (+2.46) and HSBC (+2.04%) were doing well too.

As discussed in an earlier report, the draft of Hong Kong’s security law is unlikely to bring a material impact to the Hang Seng Index, which is heavily weighted toward mainland corporations. In fact, the implementation of a national security may even help to contain violence in the street, and thus from a economic point of view, to bring social stability to the financial hub.

Technology firms, including Tencent, Meituan, Alibaba and JD.com have benefited from the Covid-19 pandemic, as more consumers seek e-commerce, gaming, streaming and other digital services. The rally in tech stocks shows no sign of ending soon.

US stock markets closed higher overnight, setting a positive tone for the Asia-Pacific open. Among the S&P 500 sectors, consumer discretionary (+1.04%), information technology (0.70%), communication (+0.61%) and health care (+0.44%) were the best performing ones, whereas utilities (-1.06%), real estate (-0.35%) and consumer staples (-0.14%) were lagging behind last night.

The Hang Seng Index is challenging a key resistance level at 25,000, which it failed to break above in early May and June. Will a tech rally empower it with momentum for a meaningful breakout? The next few days are critical.

The 20-day SMA has crossed above the 50- and 100-Day SMAs, signaling the formation of ‘golden cross’ should the price hold above 24,000. An immediate support level could be found at 24,100 – the 38.2% Fibonacci extension.

The Straits Times Index stock market benchmark has been consolidating at the 2,600-2,650 area for two weeks. Investors are cautious about a potential second viral wave in major economies and its ramification for the recovery in growth. SGX daily trading volume has also shrank alongside share prices, undermining risk appetite.

The announcement of a general election to be held on 10th July didn’t bring much of a surprise and volatility to Singapore’s stock market. An election now will give the new government a fresh five-year mandate to focus on imminent Covid issues and long term development plans.

Technically, the index has found a strong support at 2,600, where its 50- and 100-Day SMAs cross.

Yesterday, gold price had a meaningful breakout above US$ 1,750 – a major resistance level. The rally seemed to have legs as the US Dollar Index continued to drift lower. Rising demand for inflation-hedge assets is probably another key driver behind gold prices.

Gold prices have likely broken out above an ‘Ascending Triangle’ after piercing through US$ 1,750. It has now opened room for more upside towards US$ 1,800 and then US$ 1,870 – the 161.8% Fibonacci extension. The MACD indicator suggests there could be more upside in the near term.

2020-06-24||President Volodymyr Zelenskyi calls on Ukrainians working abroad to return to the country

Vitaliy Makhinko, from the Ukrainian Migrant trade union, believes it’s impossible to make estimates with any certainty. Some experts, such as demographer Ella Libanova, gave alternative estimates, claiming that between 450,000 and 500,000 migrants may have returned.

“There’s no data on migrants. Alongside workers, many students have also returned from abroad. How can we separate them from [labour] migrants in the statistics?” Makhinko asks.

Remittances from migrant workers are an important source of income for Ukraine. In 2019, Ukrainian labour migrants transferred more than US$12.2 billion to Ukraine, amounting to 7.8% of the country’s GDP. This is a record number since the National Bank started maintaining statistics in 2015. Most of the money - $3.68 billion (almost 31% of all funds transferred into the country) - came from Poland.

But the Ukrainian government has temporarily banned migrant workers from leaving the country during quarantine, including refusing permission for European countries to transport Ukrainians for seasonal work in charter planes - causing a sizable public scandal in the process.

As a result, there’s a hostile mood among some Ukrainian migrant workers towards government efforts to prevent them from leaving the country. They have few job prospects, and cannot receive state financial assistance for temporary unemployment (most of them never get an employment contract). Those who want to go back to work, or those who planned to go for seasonal work abroad in May in any case, are travelling anyway - even if a taxi journey is much more expensive than traditional transport.

“There are no offers on the Ukrainian labour market for returning migrants,” Oleg Borisov says. “In addition, they cannot do the same work they did abroad - service, care, construction and agriculture - because those sectors aren’t as developed here as in Europe."

Europe wants Ukrainian workers - even more so, it turns out, due to the pandemic. The number of available migrants from the poorest countries inside the EU like Romania and Bulgaria is not sufficient, and some EU states are trying to bring Ukrainians to their countries to harvest crops. Around 200 Ukrainians, despite the official position, have already flown to Finland for seasonal work - on a charter flight organised by a Finnish company looking for workers. Ukraine has received similar diplomatic requests from Germany, Italy and Poland. The authorities agreed to consider every application from each country separately in order to permit migrant workers to travel.

But the Ukrainian government is reluctant. In April, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba stated it is ‘illogical to organise mass charter flights at the same time to export Ukrainians to countries where pandemic is ongoing’.

Poland appears to be the most interested in Ukrainian workers, as the majority of them were already working there before the pandemic (almost 12% of all workers). Poland has the most liberal legislation of work permits for Ukrainians and relies on them heavily, with a National Bank study estimating their contribution to 11% of Poland’s GDP between 2014 and 2018.||0
2020-06-24||In mid-April, Finn Gnadt, an 18-year-old student from Kiel, Germany, learnt that he had been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus despite feeling well. Gnadt’s parents had fallen ill after a river cruise in Austria, so his family was tested for virus antibodies, which are produced in response to infection.

Gnadt thought he had endured the infection unscathed, but days later, he started to feel worn out and exceedingly thirsty. In early May, he was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and his physician, Tim Hollstein at the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein in Kiel, suggested that the sudden onset might be linked to the viral infection.

In most people with type 1 diabetes, the body’s immune cells start destroying β-cells — which are responsible for producing the hormone insulin — in the pancreas, often suddenly. In Gnadt’s case, Hollstein suspected that the virus had destroyed his β-cells, because his blood didn’t contain the types of immune cells that typically damage the pancreatic islets where the β-cells live.

Coronavirus and COVID-19: Keep up to date

Diabetes is already known to be a key risk factor for developing severe COVID-191 and people with the condition are more likely to die2. “Diabetes is dynamite if you get COVID-19,” says Paul Zimmet, who studies the metabolic disease at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.

Now Zimmet is among a growing number of researchers who think that diabetes doesn’t just make people more vulnerable to the coronavirus, but that the virus might also trigger diabetes in some3. “Diabetes itself is a pandemic just like the COVID-19 pandemic. The two pandemics could be clashing,” he says.

Their hunch is based on a handful of people such as Gnadt, who have spontaneously developed diabetes4 after being infected with SARS-CoV-2, and on evidence from dozens more people with COVID-19 who have arrived in hospital with extremely high levels of blood sugar and ketones5, which are produced from fatty deposits in the liver. When the body doesn’t make enough insulin to break down sugar, it uses ketones as an alternative source of fuel. “In science, sometimes you have to start off with very small evidence to chase a hypothesis,” says Zimmet.

Researchers cite other evidence, too. Various viruses, including the one that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), have been linked with autoimmune conditions such as type 1 diabetes6. And many organs involved in controlling blood sugar are rich in a protein called ACE2, which SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect cells7.

The latest clue comes from an experimental study in miniature lab-grown pancreases published last week8 suggests that the virus might trigger diabetes by damaging the cells that control blood sugar.

Mini organs reveal how the coronavirus ravages the body

But other researchers are cautious about such suggestions. “We need to keep an eye on diabetes rates in those with prior COVID-19, and determine if rates go up over and above expected levels,” says Naveed Sattar, a metabolic-disease researcher at the University of Glasgow, UK.

To establish a link, researchers need more robust evidence, says Abd Tahrani, a clinician–scientist at the University of Birmingham, UK. “Well-constructed epidemiological cohort studies and mechanistic and experimental studies are needed,” he says.

One initiative is now under way. Earlier this month, an international group of scientists, including Zimmet, established a global database3 to collect information on people with COVID-19 and high blood-sugar levels who do not have a history of diabetes or problems controlling their blood sugar.

Cases are beginning to trickle in, says Stefan Bornstein, a physician at the Technical University of Dresden, Germany, who also helped to establish the registry. The researchers hope to use the cases to understand whether SARS-CoV-2 can induce type 1 diabetes or a new form of the disease. And they want to investigate whether the sudden-onset diabetes becomes permanent in people who’ve had COVID-19. They also want to know whether the virus can tip people who were already on their way to developing type 2 diabetes into a diabetic state.

Coronavirus breakthrough: dexamethasone is first drug shown to save lives

The study in pancreatic organoids shows how SARS-CoV-2 could be damaging the organ8. Shuibing Chen, a stem-cell biologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, and her colleagues showed that the virus can infect the organoid’s α- and β-cells, some of which then die. Whereas β-cells produce insulin to decrease blood-sugar levels, α-cells produce the hormone glucagon, which increases blood sugar. The virus can also induce the production of proteins known as chemokines and cytokines, which can trigger an immune response that might also kill the cells, according to the study8 published in Cell Stem Cell on 19 June.

Chen says the experiments suggest that the virus can disrupt the function of key cells involved in diabetes — either by directly killing them or by triggering an immune response that attacks them.

The virus also attacked pancreatic organoids that had been transplanted into mice, and cells in liver organoids. The liver is important for storing and releasing sugar into the blood stream when it senses insulin.

The organoid study8 adds strength to the argument that SARS-CoV-2 might cause or worsen diabetes, but the paper itself is not enough to prove the link, says Tahrani.

There could be more going on than some scientists suggest, says Shane Grey, an immunologist at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Sydney, Australia. The virus could trigger an extreme inflammatory state, which would impair the ability of the pancreas to sense glucose and release insulin, and dampen the ability of the liver and muscles to detect the hormone, he says. This could trigger diabetes.

Fatigue and muscle loss caused by severe infection can also push people at risk of the condition into a pre-diabetic state, says Sattar. Only long-term studies will reveal what’s really going on, he says.||1
2020-06-25||Kate and Michael Tosswill with their children on their Wairarapa farm

The banana bread is in the oven, ready to feed the shearers and rousies working hard on Kate and Michael Tosswill's farm, north-east of Masterton.

Only 800 of the 6500 strong flock of Romney will be sheared today. Then the wool will travel around the North Island to other small businesses, being turned into yarn, then home wares and garments, which were designed at Kate's kitchen table.

Just before Covid-19, Kate launched Hipi, an small business dedicated to sustainable and ethical practices, allowing consumers to follow the path the wool takes from the paddock to the purl.

“At first [Covid-19] seemed like an end-of-the-world disaster,” she said.

“But quickly we saw there was a change in the consumer trends and it strengthened what we were doing in terms of New Zealand made, sustainable, environmentally friendly products that have a story behind them.

“Buying once and buying to last.”

The former nurse and her husband purchased Bagshot Farm, a 586 hectare working sheep and beef farm in 2017. She's a keen knitter and has an eye for design, so it made sense to launch the business.

“It goes back to knitting, I've been knitting for nearly 10 years now,” she said.

“As a knitter you know ... the magic of wool. And we've got such a love of farming ... so we rolled it altogether.

“We were stoked to find if we used the best of the best of what we produced we could make some beautiful things that had a look and feel of hand knitting.”

Her company now engages with 14 other New Zealand family owned small and medium enterprises [SMEs]

Once the flock has been sheared, the wool is sent to Napier where it's spun then to a second generation family manufacturer in Auckland who machines the yarn into products – including pillows and winter clothing – before it's sent back to Kate who adds the final hand made leather components. All products get sent out the gate in a compostable bag.

“One of the best things of the journey is the people we've made connections with. They've put their own expertise in, and they are all really passionate. It's a collaboration,” she said.

“It's not just about us, and it's certainly not just an economic venture. There's some great industry good coming out of it.”

Creating a business like Hipi has benefits for not only farmers but the wool industry as a whole, which has battled with low prices, she said.

“As an industry, if we can make headway and promote strong wool then that's got a much wider benefit for farmers,” she said.

“It's a real opportunity within the strong wool space. Merino is doing some pretty great things but it's what we might be able to do with strong wool that gets quite exciting.”

Sales have been “chugging away” since the website went up, but she knows it's a challenging time for a lot of New Zealanders, and products like hers might not be top of mind.

“[But] we're finding a lot of people are buying [the products] as gifts. Whether that's wedding presents, anniversary presents, or birthday presents, particularly for that person who seems to have everything,” she said.

She's also looking to expand into baby blankets for her next range. Thinking outside the box will help the survival of the industry, she said.

“The one thing is intriguing is the face of farming is changing and what it takes to be a farmer is changing. It's lovely to challenge the norm and traditional ideas of what a farmer looks, walks, talks and smells like,” she said.

“Being a farmer [means] you're running a pretty big business, so there's a lot of skills that other farmers could bring into being more entrepreneurial.”

But for now, it's back to the banana bread and shearing shed for Tosswill, who used to be a rousie, but her career was cut short, ironically, because of a lanolin allergy.

“Food is like legal tender. You can show so much with a little cake. It's nice to be able to look after them. They do so much for us,” she said.||2
2020-06-25||Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov was the problem Novak Djokovic’s parents say, after a coronavirus outbreak related to series of exhibition matches hosted by the top-ranked player.

The alarming outbreak of Covid-19 at Novak Djokovic's Adria Tour has now been followed by a finger-pointing exchange between Djokovic's father, Srdjan, and Grigor Dimitrov's agent over where the -infection might have stemmed from.

When Srdjan Djokovic accused Dimitrov of being the source, agent Georgi Stoimenov suggested that the tournament organisers were "the ones responsible for the safe running of the event". There was also an intervention from Nick Kyrgios, the most vocal locker-room critic of the Adria Tour.

Writing on Twitter, Kyrgios posted an image of Srdjan Djokovic accompanied by his quotes on Dimitrov and said: "Nah bruh, don't push the blame."

In an interview with a Croatian broadcast channel, Srdjan Djokovic said: "Why did it all happen? It happened because the man [Dimitrov] came sick from who knows where. He did not get tested here, and he was tested elsewhere."

 * Tennis star Novak Djokovic tests positive for coronavirus



According to Srdjan Djokovic's narrative, Dimitrov could have been what epidemiologists call a "superspreader", having flown in to Belgrade in time for the start of the Adria Tour on June 13.

This was hardly the only possible explanation, especially given the intermingling of athletes from other sports with the tennis players. Nikola Jankovic was one of several basketball players who tested positive after a derby match between Red Star and Partizan, which Djokovic attended on June 10.

Another positive test was confirmed yesterday involving Serbian basketball player Nikola Jokic. He is an All-NBA centre who plays for the Denver Nuggets, and has now been forced to delay his return to the United States.

According to reports, Jokic spent time with Djokovic at the Belgrade leg of the Adria Tour.

Stoimenov said: "Grigor landed directly in Belgrade after three months' complete isolation. Neither in Belgrade or later in Zadar [the Croatian city that hosted the second leg of the Adria Tour] was he offered or required to test for coronavirus.

The event organisers are the ones responsible for the safe running of the event and creating rules to follow. Grigor strictly respected all the rules imposed by the organisers and the existing laws and regulations in the crossing of the border between Bulgaria, Serbia and Croatia."

Dimitrov, the world No 19, is -understood to have remained in California between the cancellation of Indian Wells on March 8 and his flight to Belgrade. He made a brief visit to his home town of Haskovo in Bulgaria between the Belgrade and Zadar legs of the Adria Tour.

As yet, there are no reports of Covid-19 in Haskovo. Four players - Dimitrov, Djokovic, Borna Coric and Viktor Troicki - have tested positive, along with two coaches and Djokovic's wife, Jelena. In a statement released on Tuesday night, Djokovic said: "I am so deeply sorry our tournament has done harm."

Dimitrov does not seem to have been completely asymptomatic, at least by the end of his time in Zadar. He was clearly under the weather by the end of Saturday's match with Coric, which he lost comfortably. He did not shake hands, even though that had been normal practice throughout the Adria Tour.||1
2020-06-25||Lokesh, your research looks at the science of sugars in nature, can you explain?

I’m interested in carbohydrates. By that I don’t mean the sugars we eat, but rather the carbohydrates that help cells to sense and interact with their surroundings. For example, plant and animal cells, bacteria, fungi and virus particles all have protein and carbohydrate structures called glycoproteins on their outer surfaces. These glycoproteins have specific shapes that can lock together in a handshake between the surfaces. If they fit together, this is a form of recognition or sensing.

Does this happen in Covid-19?

Yes, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 has spike-glycoproteins (S-glycoprotein) on its surface, and these can lock onto specific receptors on human cells. This means the virus can get inside our cells. Recent reports suggest that mutations in S-glycoprotein has helped the virus “jump” from animal to human host.

What have you been working on during the pandemic?

One of the technologies I am involved in is a carbohydrate-based molecular “Velcro” to capture pathogens or other agents that could be harmful. I’m the founder of a start-up called Aquila Bioscience, and we have developed a wipe that is coated with carbohydrates that grab hold of bacteria and viruses and potentially dangerous substances.

You can wipe your face and eyes and hands with this wipe, as well as surfaces. It not only removes the agent, but also captures it so it can be tested. We have been working with Defence Forces Ireland and the European Defence Agency on it, and during the pandemic we have shown that the “Velcro” captures all pathogens tested so far. Testing of Covid-19 virus is ongoing in a defence lab in the US. We are now piloting the wipes with frontline agencies.

What else do you look at?

I see living organisms, including our bodies, as incredible sensor systems. We don’t have a dashboard in front of us like in a car to tell us how various parts are performing, but we can look at a molecular level and figure out what is going on in health and disease.

So my lab is looking at the carbohydrates in mucus, a protective barrier that lines surfaces in our bodies. We are also working on a large European project to find carbohydrate signatures in urine that can tell us about a person’s nutrition, and we have been exploring how chronic stress alters carbohydrates in the body.

You are vice-president for research at NUI Galway – what are your thoughts on research in the pandemic?

I think the pandemic has shown the world that we are all deeply connected, and that research is a way out of Covid-19, it is part of the recovery. The pandemic has fostered a wonderful culture of collaboration and I am excited to see, for example, biologists working with data scientists and looking for that deeper understanding of viral infection and our response to it.

But for researchers it is also a time of great uncertainty and stress, and we need to support them and help them face this with resilience as we learn to do our research in new ways.

And finally, what has been keeping you on an even keel during the Covid-19 restrictions?

I am connecting with my family and getting out in the garden and going for walks when possible. I also try to start each day by meditating, to bring a sense of stillness and clarity to myself, and recognising the anxiety around not having as much certainty or control in our lives as we may have thought we did.||2
2020-06-25||The Japanese government’s policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic was to ask people to refrain from leaving their homes and to encourage teleworking. This column examines the effect of COVID-19 on the uptake of teleworking in a country that has the lowest use among developed countries. Overall, teleworking increased about 4 percentage points from January to March 2020, driven by industries and occupations related to information and located in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Teleworking is not suited to face-to-face services and manual labour, which saw substantial declines in worker incomes.

COVID-19 had spread worldwide by February 2020 and was declared a pandemic in March 2020. In Japan, the number of infections and deaths is much lower than in the US and Europe. Japan has also not completely closed its national borders or locked down its cities, and economic activity has continued.

The government’s policy response has been to request people to refrain from leaving their homes and to encourage telework without any penalties and punishment. This has drawn attention to telework as an effective means to continue work while preventing the spread of infection.

However, Japan has the lowest use of telework among developed countries. Despite strong promotion by government and companies in recent years, the utilisation rate of telework has remained low. Thus, Japan presents an interesting case to investigate how the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic promotes telework (Okubo 2020a,b).

In April 2020, Keio University (Okubo laboratory) and Nippon Institute for Research Advancement conducted a survey on telework, “Questionnaire Survey on the effects of the Spread of the COVID-19 on Telework-based Work Styles, Lifestyle, and Awareness”. The sample is 10,516 workers living in Japan. The questionnaire asks about the employment status, living situation, and awareness of workers as of January and March 2020.

In general, telework refers to a way of working that is not bound by time and space, using information and communications technology (ICT). In our survey, telework is defined as working at a specific place (at home or in public facilities) for hours using ICT. We therefore do not include the use of ICT devices at locations such as train stations, airports, transportation facilities, and the premises of business partners.

We find that the national average telework utilisation rate as of March 2020 was 10%, while it was 6% in January. The utilisation rate increased by about 4 percentage points only in two months. Further findings are as follows:

1. The most teleworkers are in the information services and the fewest in face-to-face service work and manual labour

By industry, communications and information services (27%) and information services and research (23%) have the highest telework utilisation rates, while restaurants and accommodation (4%) and medical care and welfare (2%) have the lowest rates (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Rate of utilisation of telework by industry category

By occupation, management consultants (51%), researchers (28%), and data processing and communication engineers (25%) see high use of telework, while doctors, dentists, veterinarians, and pharmacists (3%), public health nurses, midwives, and nurses (2%), carrying, cleaning, packaging, and related workers (2%), manufacturing process workers (2%), food and drink/cooking and customer service workers (2%), and construction and mining workers (0%) see low rates (Figure 2).

Thus, industries and occupations related to information have a relatively high rate in the utilisation of telework, while telework is not suited to face-to-face services and manual labour.

In terms of growth from January to March 2020, the rate of telework almost doubled in accounting, clerical work, and sales and retail, showing telework rapidly spread across the entire spectrum of office work. This finding is consistent with evidence from Baker (2020) and Dingel and Neiman (2020).

2. There are more teleworkers in urban areas and fewer in rural areas

The rate of utilising telework differs by region. Figure 3 shows the telework utilisation rate by prefecture. Tokyo has the highest rate at 21%. Teleworking between January and March 2020 largely grew in Tokyo; this is because the Tokyo metropolitan area has a high concentration of white-collar workers in headquarter offices and service industries, all of which are well suited to telework.

While teleworking varies across industries and occupations, the pandemic shock hit specific industries, where worker incomes substantially declined. In particular, occupations less suited to telework and with fewer teleworkers tended to experience a more negative effect from the COVID-19 pandemic shock.

Figure 4 shows the changes in income between January and March by occupational category. Half of the workers in the food, drink, and accommodation industries saw a large decline in income. By contrast, workers in information and communications, research, and public services did not see large declines in income. The occupations that experienced the most significantly negative impact are those with the lowest rates of telework (Figure 1).

Figure 4 Changes in income, by industry

The main means to prevent infection in the current pandemic is to avoid person-to-person contact, and telework has therefore been recommended. While government requests for businesses to suspend their activities have been focused on face-to-face services, in which person-to-person contact is fundamental, tasks in these industries are the least suited to telework. These industries had already suffered significant negative economic impacts, and calling on them to promote telework would only exacerbate the recession by increasing unemployment and business closures.

While economic activities need to be uniformly stopped as a countermeasure against infectious diseases, it is extremely difficult to promote telework in all industries and occupations. It is a typical contradiction between measures against infectious diseases and economic policy. More generous economic assistance will be an urgent requirement to prevent bankruptcies and unemployment in industries and occupations unsuitable to telework.

2020-06-25||The macroeconomic effects of automation and the role of COVID-19 in reinforcing their dynamics

Over the last decade there has been a tremendous progress in automation. Many tasks previously seen as un-automatable can now be performed without human labour, and the number of industrial robots in use has increased sharply. This column describes the recent trends in automation and argues that its principal effects are to increase output per capita at the expense of rising inequality. Advancing technologies have mainly replaced the routine tasks of low-skilled workers, while the incomes robots generate flow to wealthier capital owners. The current COVID-19 pandemic is likely to reinforce these trends, raising the need for a policy response.

Over the last decade, automation has increasingly been adopted as a full substitution of capital for labour—as opposed to a standard form of labour-augmenting technological change. Figure 1 illustrates this trend, charting the stock of operative industrial robots worldwide over time, based on International Federation of Robotics data (IFR 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019). The number of industrial robots increased by factor of three over the course of a decade, rising from a little over one million operative units in 2010 to a projected 3.15 million units in 2020. Over the same time, robots reportedly became capable of substituting for, or even outperforming, humans for many tasks, such as producing customised parts and medical implants using 3D printing technologies, diagnosing diseases, and assisting decision making, for example, by ‘robot judges’ (Ford 2015, Baldwin 2019, Re and Solow-Niederman 2019). In a just-released book (Prettner and Bloom 2020), we explore theory, evidence, and policy related to the economic and social consequences of the world’s increasing reliance on robots, automated processes, and artificial intelligence.

Notes: Worldwide stock of operative industrial robots in millions of units over time, according to IFR (2016, 2017, 2018, 2019), with our own interpolations for the years lacking data. The solid line refers to actual data and interpolations up to 2018, and the dotted line refers to IFR (2019) forecasts until 2022 .

While automation can (and did) improve productivity, per capita output, and living standards in general (see, for example, Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014, Acemoglu and Restrepo 2018, Graetz and Michaels 2018), two crucial aspects of automation raise concerns: its disproportionate impact on low-skill workers and its overall negative impact with respect to the share of income that goes to labour as opposed to capital. Both of these impacts tend to exacerbate income inequality.

Routine and low-skill tasks continue to be easier for robots to perform than non-routine, high-skill tasks (Arntz et al. 2017, Frey and Osborne 2017, Dauth et al. 2017, Acemoglu and Restrepo 2020). This implies that increases in the number of robots or improvements in their productivity tend to affect low-skilled workers much more adversely than high-skilled workers. Moreover, high-skilled workers tend to specialise in tasks to which automation is complementary, such as robot design and maintenance, supervision, and management. The differential impact of automation implies that the wages of low-skilled workers might stagnate and even decline in the presence of automation (Lankisch et al. 2019). This result is consistent with the data in Figure 2, which shows the real income of persons with a high school degree in the US from 1991 to 2018, according to the US Census Bureau (2020). Simultaneously, high-skilled workers’ wages may rise as a result of automation, potentially increasing wage and income inequality (Piketty 2014, Prettner and Bloom 2020).

Figure 2 Median real income of persons with a high school degree (in USD)

Notes: Median real income in US$ (base year 2018) of persons with a high school degree from 1991 to 2018 in the United States, according to the United States Census Bureau (2020).

When robots constitute a perfect substitute for labour, workers and robots compete directly on the labour market, holding human wages down. The ‘wages’ that robots earn flow to their owners and are therefore capital income. As a consequence, automation leads to a declining labour income share (Prettner 2019, Prettner and Strulik 2020). Because labour income is more equally distributed than capital ownership and capital income are, this leads—mechanically—to a further increase in overall income inequality (see Piketty 2014, Piketty and Zucman 2014). This line of argument is consistent with the trend in the labour income share shown in Figure 3. The labour income share decreased from about 65% in 1970 to below 60% in 2017 (Federal Reserve Bank 2020); at the same time, the number of robots was rising. Of course automation is not the only factor that influences the labour income share, but calibrations suggest that automation could account for an approximate one percentage point decline in the labour income share since the 1970s (Prettner 2019).

Figure 3 Share of labour compensation in GDP in the US

Notes: Share of labour compensation in GDP in the US over time, according to Federal Reserve Bank (2020) data.

To summarise, theoretical arguments and empirical results predating the emergence of COVID-19 indicate that automation has led (and will continue to lead) to (i) increasing productivity and average incomes, (ii) negative employment and wage effects for low-skilled workers, but either insignificant or positive employment and wage effects for high-skilled workers, and (iii) a decline in the labour income share (see also Prettner and Bloom 2020).

Potential policy measures to mitigate the negative consequences of automation include (i) educational investments—particularly in talented individuals from low-income households—such as stipends, tuition-fee waivers, and student housing, (ii) retraining programs for displaced workers, (iii) reforming school curricula to focus more on skills that are complementary to automation technologies and less on memorising facts, (iv) strengthening elements of the social security system that support those who are displaced by robots, such as health insurance coverage for those who are not employed, and (v) reducing taxes on labour and instead increasing taxes on polluting activities or, for example, on undeveloped land.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the assured occurrence of future pandemics foster the adoption of automation technologies and reinforce the previously described patterns. Several factors explain this relationship.

First, automation, robotics, modern information and communication technologies, and artificial intelligence have been incredibly useful in fighting the pandemic, as well as in alleviating its economic consequences. These technologies have allowed firms to continue to operate by facilitating social distancing in the workplace and by enabling remote work from home offices. In general, because better-educated workers with higher incomes can take advantage of these opportunities and many less-educated, lower-income workers cannot, automation and related technologies have translated the COVID-19 shock into greater social and economic inequality, even as they reduce the pandemic’s overall economic impact. The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on disadvantaged ethnic minorities and lower-income individuals—who have poor access to health care and often face higher infection risk due to reliance on public transportation and lack of opportunities to socially distance in the workplace—further magnifies this trend.

Second, the COVID-19 pandemic will likely accelerate the development and implementation of automation technologies because of greater incentives to substitute capital for labour. The reason is that the former is obviously not susceptible to pathogens that affect humans (although they might be quite susceptible to digital pathogens). In addition, working from home might become much more widespread, now that it has been tested on a large scale, acting against the corresponding status quo bias against remote working of firms and bureaucracies.

Third, robots and smart technologies offer great potential for disease surveillance and contact tracing, diagnosing COVID-19 and other diseases without face-to-face contact, and even disinfecting contaminated areas in hospitals and other public spaces (Blake 2020). Consequently, they may help policymakers limit the progression of COVID-19 without (or with only minimal and targeted) lockdown measures.

Fourth, supply chain and travel disruptions caused by COVID-19 might undermine the integration of economies and encourage self-reliant economic systems, at least in (strategically) important sectors such as the production of medical supplies and drugs, or the production of necessary inputs for assembling sophisticated machines, cars, and planes—the final production of which usually still occurs in high-wage countries. While policymakers might hope that the corresponding re-shoring of supply chains could help create jobs for low-skilled workers and thereby raise their wages, theoretical arguments and empirical evidence on re-shoring and automation show that this would instead enhance robot adoption and not improve the lot of low-skilled workers (Krenz et al. 2020).

While automation is likely to foster overall economic prosperity, it comes at the price of increasing inequality. The COVID-19 pandemic is reinforcing both the trend towards automation and its effects. The main challenge here is to ensure that as many as possible will benefit from the positive economic and social effects of automation to prevent a situation in which a substantial part of society is disconnected from the gains brought by technological progress.

2020-06-25||Thank you for submitting your article "Comprehensive genetic tools to target motor neurons for each muscle of the fly proboscis" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Ronald Calabrese as the Reviewing Editor, Senior Editor and Reviewer #2.

The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.

This is a co-submission of two papers. The goal of the first work is achieving genetic control over motor neurons for every muscle of the Drosophila proboscis, and it is accomplished convincingly. The degree of success constructing split Gal4 lines that label only a single bilateral pair of motor neuron corresponding to each muscle of the proboscis is really remarkable, and there is no doubt that these tools will be of tremendous use in defining the neuronal networks responsible for reaching movements of the proboscis and indeed the sucking movements also. The anatomical data presented is beautiful. After achieving genetic control over motor neurons for every muscle of the Drosophila proboscis, the authors in the second work systematically test every motor neuron that inserts on cuticle (including apodemes) and is thus likely to move the proboscis (rather than inserting on the pharynx and likely involved in sucking) with activation and inactivation experiments. By combining kinematics and some biomechanics, the authors arrive at a functional role for each of the proboscis inserting muscle and their motor neurons. The data presented is comprehensive and convincing. When combined these two papers, very clearly supersede a previous attempt (Schwarz et al., 2017) at such tool development and analysis with several important corrections and many major refinements.

Upon careful review of these two co-submitted papers (henceforth referred to a Paper 1 and Paper 2) it was the clear consensus of the reviewers that neither paper alone is strong enough for eLife and we would understand if you chose to take the paper(s) elsewhere. If on the other hand, you chose to submit the two papers to eLife as one joint paper, then we would ensure that they were sent to the same reviewers, and we think that there is a high chance of publication with a short turn-around. No new experiments or analyses are needed.

If you take the eLife route the papers should be combined and focused. One paper will be easier for the authors to present and for the reader to comprehend. One could not read the Paper 2 without constantly referring to Paper 1 and the Paper 2 contains much repetition of the findings of Paper 1.

There are several ways that the papers can be fitted together as detailed in the individual expert reviews.

1) The theme presented for Paper 1 of rhythmic vs. discrete behaviors is not effectively exploited nor can it be given the data presented. Likewise, the comparison to human reaching in Paper 2 seems premature and focusing the combined single paper on the tools developed and the wonderful anatomy and first-pass functional analysis seems more fruitful. The data Figure 9 Paper 1 seems premature and underdeveloped for publication as does the data of Figure 8 Paper 2. They are presented is support of the rhythmic vs. discrete behaviors and human reaching themes and are not compelling. We recommend removing these figures to focus the paper.

2) Efficiency with the figures would help. Figure 1 of Paper 2 could benefit from comparison directly to Figure 1 of Paper 1. Figure 2 of Paper 1 should be supplementary and fits thematically with Paper 2 material. The expert reviews suggest other figure fusions and changes.

3) The data of Figure 7 Paper 1 is reminiscent of data in Schwarz et al., 2017, albeit with corrections but need not be elaborated and could be perhaps combined with Figure 8 Paper 1, which is somewhat underdeveloped.

4) Discussions can be shortened and in Paper 2 shifted away from detailed comparison to in Schwarz et al., 2017.

5) All Essential revisions in the expert reviews should all be addressed.

In two related papers, McKellar and colleagues present the results of a screen to genetically label and optogenetically activate each motor neuron that innervates muscles in the proboscis of Drosophila melanogaster.

In the first manuscript, entitled "Comprehensive genetic tools to target motor neurons for each muscle of the fly proboscis", they present genetic driver lines for each motor neuron together with careful anatomy of cuticular structures and musculature. Ten proboscis muscles and their associated motor neurons control the position of proboscis parts and are involved in the proboscis extension response (PER), while the remaining eight muscles control the constriction of the pharynx. In the course of this work, the authors identify several new muscles.

Once the authors develop split-Gal4 genetic labels for each motor neuron, they can drive the expression of CsChrimson to activate, or Tetanus toxin to silence, each motor neuron. They present the results of these experiments in a second paper entitled "Motor neuron control of Drosophila proboscis reaching". The main advances of this work are the resulting genetic tools and a more comprehensive knowledge of how particular muscles insert onto cuticular structures to extend or flex proboscis parts about joints. These advances clarify the results of past investigations similar into motor control of the proboscis (in particular, Schwarz, Motor control of Drosophila feeding behavior).

Across both papers, the images of motor neuron and musculature anatomy are illustrative and quite beautiful. Optogenetic activation of individual motor neurons confirms the role each plays in controlling the proboscis segment. Together, these data allow the authors to articulate a model of how motor neuron activation and muscle contraction enables the fly to extend its proboscis.

Although the tools and data in these papers are detailed and valuable, the papers do not effectively show what new insight has been gained relative to previous studies. There is also a large experimental gap: while the authors create the necessary genetic tools, they do not investigate the neural control and natural dynamics of proboscis movement beyond artificial optogenetic stimulation. In the absence of such data, the main contribution of these papers is the clear and thorough anatomy. However, the convoluted organization of the two manuscripts require the reader to sift through disparate data to reach a clear understanding of how the proboscis motor system is organized. These manuscripts would need to be significantly reorganized and streamlined to be understood by a general neuroscience audience.

1) It is not clear to why these manuscripts are separate. The basis for separating them seems to be to avoid one behemoth paper but the division between tools and function obscures the take-home message of the work. For example, many of the descriptions of musculature in "Comprehensive genetic tools to target motor neurons for each muscle of the fly proboscis" (called paper 1 below) are critical for understanding the optogenetic activation of motor neurons in "Motor neuron control of Drosophila proboscis reaching" (called paper 2 below), resulting in an unnecessary duplication of effort between the manuscripts to understand how the proboscis is moved. Take mn9, for example: it is hard to know what to take from Figure 1, Figure 4 and Figure 9 in paper 1, if the critical proof to show that mn9 extends the proboscis is in paper 2. (Past work has shown m9 to be involved in proboscis protraction, so you could argue that a knowledgeable reader may know this, but that undercuts the purpose of Figure 2 in paper 2). There are also examples of data in primary figures that do not advance the author's case. For example, in paper 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 6 and Figure 8 are supplementary figures. Figure 2: The images of FlyLight Gen 1 Gal4 lines are unhelpful, fly researchers can find these and they are not helpful to a non-Drosophilist. Figure 3: I commend the authors for including images of the entire nervous system, not often shown, but again, these are supporting information. Figure 6 can support Figure 5. Figure 8 does suggest that MNs likely do not receive direct information from sensory neurons or other previously described interneurons, but these hypotheses are not tested further, so Figure 8 can support Figure 7.

By the same token, paper 2 would benefit from schematics of muscles and an overview of reaching related vs. pharyngeal motor neurons. This distinction is helpful, and since it is consistent with past work. Because the function of pharyngeal muscles is not explored further, it would not detract from the message of paper 2. paper 2 contains functional data that can be combined: e.g. protraction (Figure 2) and retraction (Figure 3) of the rostrum could be one figure, together with anatomical data from paper 1. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5 also contain many panels of different metrics, normalized or baseline subtracted. It is not necessary to show all these data in this form, and it detracts from the message. My suggestion would be to combine Figure 2 Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5 haustellum and rostrum images. Figure 7 is beautiful! But it should be split up to accompany the data in Figure 2 and Figure 3 and Figure 4 and Figure 5.

In addition, much of the introductions of both manuscripts are either unnecessary or misleading (see below), so combining the data into a single manuscript will also help to eliminate those problems. In summary, I do not see a clear reason to split data across papers.

2) The optogenetic activation data that the authors present do not provide insight into how reaching kinematics are produced: 2 second stimulation of motor neurons is not a naturalistic manipulation, and resulting proboscis trajectories are collapsed into sing||2
2020-06-25||During even the most normal school year, there are a lot of little interruptions to teaching and learning each day—a tardy student walking into class, an announcement over the loudspeaker, a call to the classroom phone.

Those interruptions can add up to the loss of between 10 and 20 days of instructional time, a new study finds. And as schools across the country prepare to welcome back students in the fall after a disrupted spring, they will need to address what is expected to be significant learning loss. Reducing external interruptions in the classroom could be one way to do that, researchers say.

"As educators and humans, we dismiss things when we can't conceptualize the sum total, when each individual instance is very small," said Matthew Kraft, an associate professor of education and economics at Brown University and an author of the working paper. "Oh, an interruption takes 20 seconds—given the huge challenges our education system is facing, why would we focus on that? We, for the first time, provide a more precise accounting of the frequency of these interruptions, the nature of these interruptions, ... and the duration of these interuptions and the disruptions that they cause."

To better understand classroom interruptions, researchers surveyed 13,800 students, 1,500 teachers, and 70 administrators in the Providence, R.I., school district. They also conducted 63 classroom observations in five high schools in the district to time and catalogue the interruptions and the disruptions that followed. These observations happened in spring 2017.

They found that the most common outside interruption—amounting to 38 percent of all observed interruptions—was students arriving late to class. A tardy student would knock on the door, causing the teacher or another student to stop what they were doing and let them in. The teacher would then have to pause instruction to get the tardy student situated, which would often distract other students from the task at hand.

The second most common kind of interruption—17 percent—was visits by other teachers, administrators, and school staff. These interruptions were not observations or evaluations, Kraft said. Instead, visitors would knock on classroom doors to borrow materials, pull a student out of class, or get a teacher's signature.

Announcements over the loudspeaker—about sporting events, field trips, and upcoming testing, or calls for specific students to come to the office—made up 14 percent of interruptions. More than half of the announcements researchers heard were not relevant for the students or teachers in the classes they observed.

Other common interruptions were calls to classroom phones, visits by students who were not members of the class, and students returning to class after going to the office or the bathroom.

See also: How Unexpected Interruptions Hurt Student Learning (Opinion)

But the interruptions were only half the problem. Researchers noted that they often led to longer disruptions: Students would get off task and start talking about non-academic topics, including about the interruptions themselves. About 15 percent of all classroom interruptions led to disruptions that intefered with learning for the rest of the class period—students would disengage with the lesson, distract each other, or have to leave class, or the teacher would not be able to finish the lesson.

On average, the observed interruptions lasted 44 seconds, and subsequent disruptions lasted another 57 seconds. Since not every interruption resulted in a disruption, the average length of time lost was 78 seconds. Across a school year, that amounts to 54.5 hours of lost instructional time, or 10 days. Even if researchers subtracted the interruptions caused by tardy students and focus on only interruptions that are under the control of school leaders, that's still 6.7 days of lost instructional time.

Since researchers only observed classes during the spring, and only in a select five schools, they asked teachers across the district to estimate how many minutes in a typical hour-long class were lost because of external interruptions. According to their responses, an average of about seven minutes are lost in each class—up to 20.7 days of lost instructional time across the school year. Researchers estimate that a typical high school classroom in the Providence school district is interrupted 2,000 times per year.

While this study was centered in one school district, past research has confirmed that classroom interruptions are common. A 2000 study that compared videos of 8th grade math instruction in the United States and Japan found that outside interruptions occurred in about 30 percent of the U.S. lessons, but never occurred once in Japanese lessons.

"These results are not characteristic of every school out there, but I do think they highlight the challenge that a lot of teachers face in ... trying to maintain students' focus and attention," Kraft said of his study.

And minimizing these interruptions can be "a surprisingly feasible and low-cost way to recoup lost instructional time," he said, especially as schools are grappling with what will likely be a significant "COVID-19 slide."

He recommends that school leaders ask their teachers to record every class interruption for a week and then examine the data. One easy solution, Kraft said, would be turning off the intercom system and only making schoolwide announcements during advisory periods or homeroom. Another way would be to email or text teachers with requests instead of calling them on the classroom phone, he said.

Teachers could also put a sign on their door asking visitors to leave a note instead of knocking, or designate one student to help acclimate any tardy students, the paper says.

"Some interruptions are necessary and likely important," Kraft said. "We need to do fire drills, we need to [provide students with] specialized services, we need to promote a school culture of openness and provide formative feedback. From our experience, very few of the interruptions were those types."

And the constant interruptions are frustrating for both students and teachers, he said.

"We are implicitly saying, 'We don't value your work or your time,' when we ask teachers to work in an environment where we are constantly interrupting their practice with what are often, but not always, quite trivial interruptions," he said.||0
2020-06-25||Among researchers, PhD students are perhaps suffering the most from coronavirus lockdown restrictions put in place around the world. Interruptions caused by the pandemic are producing a cohort of worried research students who are concerned about the completion and quality of their work.

One student in our department at Edge Hill University in Ormskirk, UK, is working on the conservation ecology of a rare butterfly and needs to synchronize her fieldwork with the insect’s flight period. This lasts from late June until late July, so this year’s field season will almost certainly be lost. Another student, a microbiologist, started her PhD only a few months ago, and has no laboratory access and thus no means of generating data.

At the other end of the PhD timescale, a student investigating the molecular basis of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes is facing difficult decisions on the feasibility of a planned final round of experiments. Does she wait, and continue once insect stocks are raised and labs are functioning again, or does she curtail the work and proceed with writing up, knowing that important evidence might be missing?

It is unlikely that any of these students would have a problem getting extensions to their deadlines — but extensions to funding might not be so easily available.

Coronavirus and COVID-19: Keep up to date

As student and supervisor, we soon found ourselves facing the same dilemmas. When the lockdown seemed imminent, we discussed our plans — and potential alternatives — for the next few weeks. As the situation worsened and the prospect of long-term effects became a reality, our meetings came to cover growing anxieties over the future of the project. We talked about the restrictions imposed on our plans by the pandemic and what financial support or extra time the university plans to provide to postgraduate researchers. We then realized that, to move forwards, we had to welcome change.

Right now, there is a generation of PhD students stuck at home for whom the constraints and uncertainty created by the coronavirus present a unique obstacle. We think that doctoral projects — like many other ongoing projects — should be adapted to the circumstances by encouraging creative thinking and updating academic standards. Here are five ideas for students (and supervisors) in a similar situation to ours. We acknowledge that some will not be feasible, but we consider it important that PhD students think creatively and strategically about the options open to them.

Consider a different research route for the project

Less time available in the lab or in the field might mean a new approach is required to address the research question. Think about a fresh perspective or element for the project. For instance, after discussions with her supervisors, our butterfly researcher has transformed her original plans — to manipulate the insect’s habitat to assess the impact of vegetation changes — into a meta-analysis of the relevant literature.

Update the plans for the research. Be ruthless. PhD students and their supervisors should identify analyses that they can do while working from home, important experiments to set up as soon as possible and experiments to omit if time is going to be more limited.

Consider reducing the number of chapters in the thesis.

The academic requirements for a PhD are to generate original findings and place them in the wider context of the literature. In many cases, this is possible in fewer chapters than initially planned. There might subsequently be one less paper, but university employers and funding bodies will recognize this new reality. The world of science should accept that it’s OK to do less during this unprecedented situation.

Despite the cancellation of conferences and seminars, there are still opportunities to discuss your ideas or plans with colleagues. For instance, several societies and research communities are opening up online spaces for researchers — especially early-career scientists — to provide inspiration through social media. Use these platforms to get fresh ideas for the project, and to present some results and plans, and get feedback on them.

Be upfront about the challenges with the examiners.

When the time comes for the viva, be confident in explaining the effects of the pandemic on the project in the thesis’s introduction or in the PhD defence. The external examiners will have seen the impact on their own research and will be sympathetic to the challenges you have faced. A favourite question among examiners is how the project has evolved as it progressed. The current crisis gives students a head start in answering this.

Even without the disruption and uncertainty caused by the pandemic, a PhD is rarely smooth sailing. However, a smooth sea never made a skilled sailor. For PhD students, this global crisis is an opportunity to show resilience as researchers negotiating the choppy ocean of their projects. The rest of us should remember that PhD students rely on their supervisors and research community for direction and encouragement. The pandemic is likely to take a toll on their mental health over and above the usual pressure from deadlines and the demand for publications. In these strange times, research students need our support and understanding more than ever.||1

I a panel of experts convened by the World Health Organisation ( ) put together a list of diseases that posed big public-health risks but for which there were few or no countermeasures. It featured various well-recognised threats, including Ebola, , Zika and Rift Valley fever. But it also included “Disease X”.

This illness, caused by a pathogen never before seen in humans, would, the panel said, emerge from animals somewhere in a part of the world where people had encroached on wildlife habitats. It would be more deadly than seasonal influenza but would spread just as easily between people. By hitching rides on travel and trade networks, it would journey beyond its continent of origin within weeks of its emergence. It would cause the world’s next big pandemic, and leave economic and social devastation in its wake.

Less than two years after the report was published Disease X turned up. It began late last year in Wuhan, China, and the wider world became aware of it in January. It has now infected nearly 10m people and killed almost 500,000 of them. That death toll is also likely to reach seven figures before things are over. For Disease X now has a name: covid-19.

Though perhaps the loudest, the ’s was not the only warning that something like this might happen. Moreover, some of the prophets, such as Peter Daszak, a disease ecologist who is head of an independent research organisation called the EcoHealth Alliance, specifically focused on the risk posed by bat-borne coronaviruses, as - o -2, the cause of covid-19, has turned out to be. And the point of issuing those warnings was preparedness. With the correct systems in place a potential pandemic, spotted early, might be nipped in the bud.

Instead, the world’s response to the new illness has been similar to its response to in 2002 and, after that, to 1 avian influenza in 2005. This is to move into a costly panic mode intended to slow the spread of the disease while scientists race to develop a vaccine. “This,” as Dr Daszak, observes wryly, “is not a plan.”

To see Disease X simply as a warning about covid-19 that the world ignored is, though, to miss the point that the panel was making. Disease X was also a warning about Disease Y, and after it Disease Z. It was a warning about aspects of modern life that encourage the spread of previously unknown pathogens like - o -2. As long as these matters are not addressed, the risk will remain of further zoonotic outbreaks, in which a pathogen passes from animals to human beings, and then from human to human in the exponential way now sadly familiar.

Dr Daszak’s point is that the matters in question can and should be dealt with. Future zoonotic outbreaks are surely inevitable. But with the right precautions it should be possible to ensure that they do not, as the current one has, lead to pandemics.

The precautions Dr Daszak and his colleagues have in mind add up to a three-layered defence. The first layer is a worldwide effort to find and track the hundreds of thousands of as-yet-unseen pathogens that might threaten human health. The second is the monitoring of blood samples and other indicators from people living in places where new diseases are most likely to emerge. The third is a concerted programme that employs all the data thus collected to get a head-start in the development of drugs and vaccines that might be used to meet an emerging disease halfway.

More than 1,400 pathogens are known to infect human beings. Only a fifth of these are viruses. But viruses are the cause of more than two-thirds of new human diseases, which is why both the discussion and the effort are focused on them.

Being simple organisms that can reproduce quickly, viruses undergo much more rapid evolution than other types of pathogens. Hence their ability to adapt to novel hosts. Simian immunodeficiency virus ( ), for example, moved from monkeys to chimpanzees and, separately, to gorillas before one of the chimpanzee strains got into people and became , which went on to cause the pandemic (see article). Influenza viruses that break out into human beings are routinely found to have cycled through pigs or chickens first. And - o , as the virus which caused the outbreak in 2002 is now known, started in bats before (it is widely believed) migrating to civets.

Ecologically, human beings as a species are particularly likely to be on the receiving end of this process. Few wild animals spend as much time cooped up with members of their own and other species as do herd animals and their herders. So when people domesticated animals and began to live in large, fixed settlements they gave viruses many opportunities to jump back and forth between species, a process called viral chatter. Many common diseases date back to the early days of domestication, and the population densities it brought with it. The species involved were not all domesticated. Smallpox appears to have come from rats. But the animals involved were ones that thrived in human company.

Zoonoses have continued ever since. Of more than 330 diseases which emerged between 1940 and 2004, over 60% were zoonotic. Of those over 70% originated in wildlife. For viruses the proportions were 69% and 87% respectively (see chart). This process seems to be accelerating. As human populations grow, previously wild areas are settled. That brings people into contact with sources of infection they would not otherwise have encountered. And, having encountered them, it is also easier to pass them on. Modern transport means that if a disease gets into people living in this frontier between civilisation and the wilderness it can quickly make its way to a local metropolis and thence, courtesy of lorries, trains and planes, to others anywhere in the world. The idea that these risks deserve systematic appraisal and monitoring surfaced after the emergence, in 2005, of the strain of avian influenza. This was first detected in 1996, when it killed some geese in Guangdong province, China. The following year it infected 18 people associated with a poultry market in neighbouring Hong Kong, six of whom died. But for most of the subsequent decade the virus was restricted to farmed birds on the Chinese mainland. In 2004, however, a highly pathogenic strain emerged and began to spread across South-East Asia, killing tens of millions of birds. By the middle of 2005 this version of the virus had infected wild geese, which took it into Europe, India and Africa. That year, 98 people were infected, and 43 of them died—a death rate severe enough for David Nabarro, then co-ordinator of the ’s response to influenza, to issue a warning that an unchecked outbreak could kill up to 150m people. In 1968 a less pathogenic strain of flu, which had originated in the same area, killed 1m people when it spread around the world. In 1957 a still-earlier relative killed 1.1m. was considerably more lethal than either.

In the end, forms of that could spread easily from person to person never arose. But they came close. In 2012 Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ron Fouchier of Erasmus University in Rotterdam undertook to discover how many mutations would have been required to make transmissible between people via the droplets expelled in a sneeze. They found that changes at just five points in the genome would have done the trick. Two of these mutations were later shown to exist already in wild populations of the virus.

Fortunately, the other three never happened. The disease was brought under control among farmed birds, though it still circulates at a low level in wild populations, and human fatalities remained in the tens, rather than the tens of millions. This near miss may have spurred complacency among laymen. Scientists’ dire warnings had come to naught. Among virologists and epidemiologists, though, it was a call to action—and one which came at an opportune time. The cost of sequencing the and in which viruses store their genes was, in the second half of the 2000s, falling at extraordinary speed (see Graphic detail). That made virus hunting possible on a previously unimaginable scale.

In 2009 Dennis Carroll, an infectious-disease expert at , America’s international development agency, who had led that agency’s response to the outbreak, set up . This project investigated and catalogued potential disease threats to people living near wildlife, with a particular focus on viruses. A few years later Jeremy Farrar, an infectious-disease doctor who was then at Oxford University’s clinical research unit in Ho Chi Minh City and now heads the Wellcome Trust, a large medical-research charity, created Vizions. This project tracked pathogens circulating in people and animals living close together in farms and markets across Vietnam.

ran for just over a decade. Scientists working with local teams in 30 countries collected around 170,000 samples from people and wild animals, mainly non-human primates, bats and rodents. In the process they discovered 1,200 new viruses belonging to families known to have the potential to infect people and cause epidemics. Among these were more than 160 potentially zoonotic coronaviruses.

This, though, just scratched the surface. On the basis of how much they found during their early work Dr Carroll and his colleagues made a statistical estimate that, all told, the world’s mammals and birds play host to between 700,000 and 2.6m as yet unknown species from families of viruses that have shown the potential to cause zoonotic disease in humans. Between 350,000 and 1.3m of these unknown viruses, they argued, could have zoonotic potential.

In 2018 Dr Carroll, Dr Daszak and Jonna Mazet, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Davis, put forward a proposal aimed at turning those statistical estimates into genetic seque||2
2020-06-25||I 1990s, at the end of every workday, Matshidiso Moeti would lock a notebook in her desk at Botswana’s ministry of health. Written inside were the names of Botswanans who had tested positive for . The stigma of having the virus that causes meant there had to be the “deepest secrecy”, she recalls.

Soon a single notebook was not enough. By the end of the 1990s more than a quarter of Botswanans aged 15-49 had the virus, the highest rate in the world. Between 1986 and 2001 life expectancy fell by more than a decade, from 61 to 50 years—lower than when the country became independent in 1966.

The / pandemic was the formative experience for many of the doctors leading the response to covid-19. Dr Moeti is director of the World Health Organisation’s Africa region. Anthony Fauci, who advises President Donald Trump, earned his spurs during America’s crisis. “I draw on for just about everything we do,” says Salim Abdool Karim, who advises President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa.

The two great pandemics of the past 50 years are very different. is usually spread via sex, can take years to cause disease and if untreated is highly lethal. In Cameroon it was called le poison lent, the slow poison. - o -2, the virus that causes covid-19, is less deadly, but spreads and manifests much more quickly. Nevertheless / is a constant reference point. When Dr Moeti reads the latest covid-19 case numbers, she thinks of those notebooks.

An understanding of / matters for another reason. It is a reminder that pandemics do not readily disappear. Life-prolonging treatments have turned / into a mostly chronic disease. New infections have decreased for 25 years. Yet 1.7m people were newly infected in 2018. Globally 32m people have died from . Despite biomedical advances there is no cure and no vaccine. Human behaviour and norms had to change. Tens of millions deal with the vast indirect impacts, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The worst of the pandemic may be over, but its effects endure.

The history of in humans began around a century ago. Scientists think that the virus responsible for the vast majority of cases, -1, crossed the species barrier from chimpanzees in the 1920s or earlier in central Africa. It spread slowly for decades, before transmission accelerated worldwide in the 1970s.

In 1981 the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention ( ), an American public-health body, warned about outbreaks of pneumonia and a skin cancer, Kaposi’s sarcoma, in gay men, as well as a number of “opportunistic infections” taking advantage of a breakdown in the body’s immune system. When other cases were soon reported among Haitian migrants, haemophiliacs and heroin users, as well as babies of infected women, what had been Gay-related immunodeficiency disease ( ) became Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( ). Diagnoses followed in other parts of the world. In 1983 was discovered as the cause.

The early years of the pandemic were characterised by confusion and fear. Once symptoms emerged people typically died within 12 months. By the end of the 1980s it was one of the leading causes of death for young men in many rich countries. Andrew Sullivan, a gay journalist who is positive, recalls “witnessing the sickness and death of others, knowing that you too could be next, even as you feel fine.” In “How to Survive a Plague”, the American author David France recounts trips to the doctor at the merest hint of a skin blemish.

Some revelled in the terror. Most people catch through heterosexual sex, but in many rich countries the majority of cases were among gay men. “The poor homosexuals—they have declared war upon nature, and now nature is exacting an awful retribution,” said Pat Buchanan, an adviser to Ronald Reagan, who was elected president of the United States in 1980. Venom was coupled with hysteria. Just one undertaker in New York City would embalm victims.

It did not help that the Reagan administration was neglectful. The federal government shortchanged and slowed efforts to prevent, treat and research / . The president did not mention the disease in public until 1985. Similarly Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister of Britain, was squeamish about safe-sex campaigns and had to be overruled by Norman Fowler, her health secretary, who launched the “Don’t Die of Ignorance” campaign in 1986.

Today it’s me, tomorrow someone else

Ultimately it was people with who did much to turn the tide of the disease. Safe-sex campaigners popularised the use of condoms, while activists pressed the Food and Drug Administration, which approves medicines, to accelerate clinical trials. In America Dr Fauci, then as now the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, went from being a target of activists to becoming an ally. Larry Kramer, the irascible founding father of activism, who died aged 84 on May 27th, considered Dr Fauci “the only true and great hero” in officialdom (Kramer originally thought he was “an incompetent idiot”).

The first evidence that combination antiretroviral therapy ( ), a cocktail of -suppressing drugs, could radically change the course of the disease arrived in 1996. led to dramatic reductions in mortality rates. Patients spoke of a “Lazarus effect”. It was a turning point in rich countries. Histories of the American epidemic often end here—with a coda on how the / epidemic helped human rights and probably accelerated public acceptance of same-sex marriage.

But in developing countries the situation remained grim. Most -positive people have always lived in Africa, where the virus is overwhelmingly spread via heterosexual sex. By 1996 was the most common cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa. In Zimbabwe life expectancy fell to 43 in 2003.

There is no single reason for the severity of the pandemic in Africa. There are biological reasons to consider, from the amplifying role of tuberculosis, high rates of other sexually transmitted diseases, the potential role of African genomes, and the viral subtypes common in Africa. Then there is the swish of Occam’s razor by John Iliffe in “The African Epidemic”, in which he writes that: “Africa had the worst epidemic because it had the first epidemic.”

Multiple theories have been put forward, most containing some truth. Poverty, for example, matters. When cost at least $10,000 per person per year, as it did in 1996, only elites could be treated. But poverty does not explain why prevalence was already so high. More than a fifth of adult residents of capitals such as Kampala and Lusaka were -positive by 1990. Other poor parts of the world, including central America, South Asia and the Caribbean were less affected. Botswana and South Africa, two of the richest African countries, are two of the hardest hit.

It is impossible to understand AIDS in Africa without a grasp of sexual inequality

Sex is wrapped up with power dynamics. It is impossible to understand in Africa without a grasp of sexual inequality. A survey of rural women who migrated to Kinshasa, Congo’s capital, revealed that many contracted after entering into transactional sexual relationships, often with older, richer men. To this day, across the region, the rates of infection among young women are far higher than among young men. In some cases women either do not feel a need to insist on condom use or are not able to insist.

Another amplifying factor was the responses of African leaders. Some, such as Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni, talked openly about the disease (even if he was sceptical about condoms). Others saw / as a Western plot or denied that it existed because Africa did not have homosexuals.

Worst was Thabo Mbeki, who succeeded Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa in 1999. While surfing the internet, he encountered the ideas of denialists, or “dissidents”, who claimed that the virus was not the cause of the disease. He prevented poor South Africans from getting state-funded s, while backing a scheme to develop a local alternative that turned out to be an industrial solvent. Activists and judges eventually brought about a more rational set of policies. But not before 340,000 needless deaths, estimates Nicoli Nattrass, an economist.

Religion also played a role; sometimes for good, but often for ill. Data from Afrobarometer, a pollster, suggest that religious figures are more respected than other pillars of society. As in America, many saw / as punishment for sin, with some churches opposing condoms and refusing to bury victims. Traditional religions could be unhelpful, too. In Malawi hundreds of thousands flocked to one healer who claimed ancestral spirits had instructed him in the use of a tree bark to cleanse people of the disease.

Blame, stigma and denial discouraged open conversations about / . In Congo, , the French initials for , was said to stand for syndrome imaginaire pour décourager les amoureux, or “imaginary syndrome to discourage lovers”. Though some famous Africans, such as Philly Lutaaya, a Ugandan singer, were honest about their condition; others, like Fela Kuti, a Nigerian musician, were not.

The fear of what an diagnosis might mean for your family, or your position within it, was pervasive. Some traditional religions saw early deaths as a break in the ancestral chain. And if you were the first in your family to test positive, you could be accused of bringing the disease into a household. Since women were more likely to get tested, and because of the possibility of transmitting the virus to a fetus, they were at greater risk of stigmatisation. It is perhaps unsurprising then that, despite widespread knowledge of / by the 1990s, only a minority of positive Africans got tested. And why bother with a test when there was no affordable treatment? was often only one issue among many. Data from Afrobarometer suggest that / has never been a major election issue anywhere, bar Botswana. The result was that / enfeebled workers.

2020-06-25||A slew of dour headlines prompted a shift in risk sentiment on Wednesday, driving equities lower and dragging commodity and growth led currencies downward. The Australian dollar slipped back below 0.69 US cents amid increasing market nervousness, as a surge in COVID 19 cases prompts calls for renewed social distancing measures, while US and EU trade tensions and a correction in the IMF economic outlook added further weight to the risk off move, forcing the AUD toward intraday lows at 0.6865.

The Australian dollar, having failed in its bid to push above 0.70 US cents now appears somewhat range bound, bouncing between 0.6830 and 0.6960, with more broader supports in play on moves approaching 0.6780 and 0.67. Demand for risk continues to be the primary force governing direction and as markets grapple with an ever-shifting risk on risk off mood, volatility within recent ranges has increased. Investors have become increasingly sensitive to headline news as the risk on move that sustained the AUD upturn through April and May runs out of steam and markets are not yet willing to shift focus to underlying fundamental indicators. With Covid19 infection rates soaring around the world hopes of a prompt rebound in economic activity are beginning to wane capping AUD upside through the short term and opening the door to a longer period of consolidation and increasing downward pressure.

Attentions today turn again to US unemployment claims as the headline item on the macroeconomic docket, while Coronavirus headlines and trade tensions direct risk sentiment.

The US dollar was the big winner Wednesday, as risk sentiment soured and investors sought safety in haven assets. An alarming rise in coronavirus infection rates around the world, with the US recording its second largest increase in new infections since the pandemic began prompted calls for a return to strict social distancing controls. Investors appear to be finally coming to grips with the fact that the second wave of infections will likely derail the economic rebound as a longer path to recovery lies ahead. A fact evidenced by the IMF most recent review of economic activity. The IMF now expects global output will shrink almost 5%, up from its 3% estimate in April, as advanced economies like the US suffer unprecedented declines in GDP output.

The Euro Fell through 1.13 and 1.1250, touching intraday lows at 1.1245 after the office of US trade published a note, announcing new tariffs will be imposed on over $3 billion of European imports, with some tariffs as high as 100%. The note comes as the World Trade Organization rules on EU issued tariff on US goods and serves as a reminder of US-EU trade tensions.

The Canadian dollar fell sharply as oil prices plunged amid concerns increasing coronavirus infections will force renewed lockdown measures and re-ignite supply issues that plagued oil markets in April.

Attentions today remain affixed to risk demand as investor sentiment is perhaps finally shifting back toward a more conservative playbook.

2020-06-26||The Australian dollar crept marginally higher through choppy trade on Thursday as investor attentions remain squarely affixed to the largely unchecked spread of COVID-19 throughout the US, Latin America and South Africa. Having touched intraday lows at 0.6851 the AUD edged upward to mark session highs at 0.6890, but struggled to break outside the 40 point range despite a number of short run upward rallies. Markets appeared reluctant to extend gains across commodity currencies and risk assets, leaving equities, the AUD, NZD and CAD mostly flat on the day.

The re-emergence and rapid spread of new Coronavirus cases across the US has spooked investors, dampening expectations for a swift rebound in economic activity. With the US recovery interrupted, investors are coming to terms with the realities of the current environment and a long/protracted rebuild. The risk on/risk off battle of the past fortnight is starting to tip toward a broader risk-off move with haven assets finding increased support. Equities lost 1.5% through early trade before regulatory change in the US meant a freeing of capital for US banks, prompting a jump in financial stocks that propped up the S&P 500.

As sentiment plays an increasingly important roll in short-term direction our focus remains with broader equity performance as a marker of investors’ appetite for risk. A deeper risk-off move will likely put pressure on short-term supports at 0.6830/40 and could see the AUD retreat back toward 0.67 and possibly 0.66.

The US dollar crept higher through trade on Thursday when measured against a basket of major counterparts, up two tenths of a percent and closing in on four week highs as concerns surrounding a coronavirus resurgence pushes investors toward haven assets. The rapid spread of new infections across a swathe of US states, with Texas and North Carolina forced to suspend plans to re-open their economies and instead impose new measures to try and control their respective outbreaks, has prompted investors to begin re-assessing expectations for a prompt rebound in economic activity. Even if other State and Federal officials continue with the wider economic opening, activity through the short-term is likely to be muted and the recovery process slowed. This fact is beginning to weigh on investors and we are seeing the beginnings of a shift in broader sentiment. A sustained risk-off shift will likely see the USD find renewed short-term demand as markets unwind risk plays.

The GBP is lower this morning after the UK’s Chief Brexit negotiator refused to agree to a compromise on tariffs. While the focus remains largely with the battle against the coronavirus, there is still a long way to go before the UK leaves the EU at the end of the year and further delays/setbacks in divorce negotiations are adding further downward pressure on the GBP. Having slipped below 1.24, the GBP appears well supported on moves approaching 1.2350 for now, but a sell off in risk could prompt a move back toward 1.22 and 1.20.

2020-06-26||Lunchtime in Eyre Square: sunshine and shadows, a small gang of skateboarders doing tricks, a busker singing Black is the Colour and, for June, a marked absence of tourists. It is a time like no other and that extends to Irish politics.

Peter Allen, Pat O’Grady and Frank Greally stand under the shade of a tree and discuss what is a singular moment for their party, Fine Gael. They’ve seen each other plenty on Zoom meetings with other party members in their Galway West constituency, with long talks about the programme for government and what the proposed coalition would mean for their party.

“I think we can deal with it either way,” says Allen.

“If we end up in government, I think fine. We would prefer to be in opposition after so many years in government. And if you were to look at this in a cold way of what is best for the party, you might decide we should walk away. But I do think this is the worst challenge we will face. It is not a time for people with theories and knowledge. You need practitioners. And Fine Gael has those.”

All three men come from families with Fine Gael affinities but say that the principles and conduct of Garret FitzGerald were what drew them to becoming actively involved.

For Greally, Declan Costello was another key influence. They are not afraid of the implication that five years of government could render them indistinguishable from Fianna Fáil. But that fear of loss of identity has left some local party members strongly against the alliance.

“Their main fear is that the identity of the party will disappear,” says Allen. “If it lasts five years, will we be decimated in the polls? But you have five years to make a mark. Most that were vehemently against it at the start have listened and moved to ‘I mightn’t like it but we have to do it.’”

Do they, though?

The Government’s performance during the Covid-19 pandemic has led to a Fine Gael resurgence in opinion polls. What if they just went to the electorate again now, with the economy reopening and the sun shining?

“I don’t think we’d be thanked,” says Allen.

“Fine Gael will try to form a government,” says O’Grady. “But not at any price. We have our own views. It used to be called the Christian Democratic side of Fine Gael in the times of Sweetman and Costello. We will go so far but we won’t sell ourselves completely.”

The decision may not be theirs anyway.

“If the Greens vote against this, then I think we will be out of it,” Allen adds.

They are proud of Fine Gael’s record since coming into power in 2011 when the country was buckled by the economic recession and the response to the pandemic. That experience is why they feel their party needs to remain in government.

“But it is time to be radical,” says Greally.

“And Fine Gael have been radical in the past with rural electrification, the land commission. And where we will need radical thinking now is achieving the green emission targets for agriculture, which is one-third of our emissions.

“The average age of farmers in Ireland is over 60. We need young people and we need to copy the land commission and bring in young ambitious people who would expand the horticultural side. The current generation have been extremely good farmers but we all get a bit more conservative as we get older. Imposing targets on them is not going to work.”

There are some positive aspects for the local economy written into the programme – the transport plan for the city, hospital advancements and Greally is optimistic that Galway city and county council can move on greenway plans.

“There is €360 million there for cycle ways but it is first come, first served and it is up to them to take advantage. But other than the green deal and tax, I don’t see where the priority is. There is no real understanding of the total imbalance between the regions in Ireland. The west-northwest has gone from developed to transition, and it could go from there to poor if nothing happens.”

Someone came up to Allen recently and told him that the Greens were “just Fine Gael with bicycles”. It made him laugh but he would argue that the party’s old, small-farming loyalty remains. But there is an acknowledgement that Irish voting patterns are more fluid and unreadable than before.

“So we have to evolve,” O’Grady says.

“And we are evolving. Fine Gael know their identity better than most parties. There will be closer links between the two big parties regardless of the outcome of the current vote. It may happen that some of Fianna Fáil will move towards Fine Gael and the more Republican element move closer to Sinn Féin. What you call that, I don’t know. But you are looking at the start of a realignment in Irish politics.”||2
2020-06-26||The second round of French municipal elections on Sunday is likely to be a humiliation for President Emmanuel Macron, whose party La République en Marche is unlikely to win a single town with a population of more than 10,000.

Paris was always going to be first prize in the municipal poll, and Macron once had hopes of wresting it from the Socialists who have ruled the capital for the past two decades. But the Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo, who is openly hostile to Macron, is virtually certain to be re-elected, after a disastrous campaign by LREM.

Benjamin Griveaux, the president’s first choice for mayor of Paris, had to withdraw from the race last winter due to a sexting scandal. He was replaced by the former health minister Agnès Buzyn. She was placed a distant third in the first round last March, then criticised the way the government she participated in handled the Covid-19 epidemic.

Macron was unable to persuade the mathematician and renegade LREM deputy Cédric Villani to end his independent candidacy, which siphoned votes from the official LREM candidates.

The Paris campaign laid bare Macron’s greatest weaknesses, his failure to create a local base for LREM, and what might be called a human resources problem, due to the lack of seasoned politicians in his young party.

The Élysée gives the impression it is eager to put the embarrassing municipal poll behind it. A presidential adviser focused on “the new stage” of Macron’s presidency at a briefing on Thursday. In the last two years of his term, Macron intends to concentrate on rebuilding the economy and redistributing power between the central government, regions and departments, to the benefit of the latter.

Macron is intent on showing that he is moving on. Rather than dwell on Sunday night’s results, he will start Monday by receiving the 150 members of the Citizens’ Convention on Climate, then travel to Meseberg, Germany, to discuss European issues with Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Macron on Thursday launched a “national independent mission on the management of the Covid-19 crisis and the risk of future pandemics”. The president chose Prof Didier Pittet of the University of Geneva to head the mission, which will run parallel to a parliamentary inquiry.

A close adviser to Macron said the very fact that local elections can be held three months after they were postponed because of the pandemic signals “a victory of reopening and the regression of the virus”. Macron hopes a high turnout will “confirm the confidence of the French in the authorities”.

Macron “does not expect any national lessons from the vote”, the adviser said. Previous local elections were held in 2014, two years before LREM was founded. LREM candidates will join the cohort of 35,000 French mayors for the first time.

“So the president will observe LREM successes here and there,” the adviser continued. “But he is president of all French people, and under the institutions he is above political parties.”

For a population of 172,000, results in the Channel port town of Le Havre are disproportionately important. Prime minister Édouard Philippe is standing for his old job as mayor and has made it clear he will withdraw to Le Havre if Macron sacks him in the cabinet reshuffle, which is slated for after the municipal poll.

Philippe has served Macron loyally and with competency. But he has refused to join LREM and is more than 10 percentage points ahead of Macron in opinion polls.

Marseille and Lyon, the second and third cities of France, are also typical of the reconfiguration of French politics.

The conservatives may lose Marseille, which they have ruled for the past quarter century. A candidate from the environmentalist party EELV surpassed the incumbent mayor from the conservative party Les Républicains by one percentage point in the first round.

EELV placed first in the first round in Lyon too, where the outgoing mayor, Gérard Collomb, has dominated politics for 20 years. Collomb, a former Socialist, was an early, prominent supporter of Macron. The president rewarded Collomb with the interior ministry, but the two men fell out and Collomb resigned.

2020-06-26||Although Florida continues to deal with a surge of identified cases of COVID-19, Major League Soccer remains confident (at least publicly) that it can pull off a safe and successful return to play. On Wednesday, the league released its full schedule of group matches, as well as TV times and listings for all group and knockout phase games.
• Much was made about the news the tournament would include 9 am ET kickoff times, but they will be only a relatively minor part (more on why below). Seven of 54 games in total will kick during the morning hour.
• There has been a change to the competition rules, with the top three teams from Group A now automatically advancing to the knockout phase (You might remember a previous post here about the inherent unfairness of the tournament draw at the time).
• The ESPN family of networks will broadcast 28 of the tournament’s 54 games in English and in Spanish. FOX and FS1 will combine for 16 broadcasts in English, and TUDN will show 23 broadcasts in Spanish, including 13 that are simulcasts with FS1 English language telecasts. (All TUDN games will be available in English on Twitter.)

More On MLS In The Morning

If you’ve gotten this far, you’ve noticed that yes, the tournament will include seven games that kick off at 9 am ET.

And they are all on weekdays, eliminating comparisons to the Breakfast at Wimbledon telecasts tennis fans know well. There’s a pretty simple reason why: weekend morning games would conflict directly with telecasts from popular leagues in Europe that continue to play their matches through the summer.

Further, all the games will be on ESPN, which is a coup for the league to have ESPN’s popular ‘Get Up’ morning show as lead-in programming. If MLS can’t grow its modest but stable in broadcast ratings in that environment, it just might not be possible.

Another small but noteworthy detail is that the league did not unilaterally “punish” East Coast teams by assigning them all the morning matches. No teams play more than one early game. Of the 14 involved in them, eight are from the Eastern Time Zone, four from the Central, and one each from the Mountain (Real Salt Lake) and the Pacific (Seattle Sounders).

Maybe the most welcome twist of the tournament is that the conference structure does not appear to factor into the knockout stages. Teams from the East and West can meet in a round of 16 and presumably in additional rounds prior to the final.

For a tournament expected to more or less replace the 2020 U.S. Open Cup on the calendar this year, it’s refreshing to see it address the often-criticized regionalization of the nation’s. In Cup Competitions in other nations, part of the allure is a random draw format that makes it possible for two giants to meet in the early rounds, or two local rivals to be separated until the final. That never happens in the U.S. Open Cup. But in the MLS is Back Tournament, it appears that at least the latter is possible.||2
2020-06-26||The result of the Green Party vote on the programme for government could be “on a knife edge,” party sources have said.

Some 2,000 members of the party are expected to participate in the internal ballot with a two-thirds majority required if the party is to enter coalition.

A number of internal sources have said that because of opposition to the plan in Northern Ireland as well as opposition among the youth wing of the party, support levels of up to 80 per cent may be needed at a constituency level.

Of those registered to vote for the Greens, some 195 are in Northern Ireland.

Counting of the votes will begin on Friday morning and a result is expected at about 6pm.

“If the numbers are close, if we just about get the required backing, there may be calls for a recount. This would take us closer to 9pm realistically,” a party source said, adding that soundings from constituencies indicated the result may be tighter than expected.

The Greens initially allowed telephone voting only for members outside the the Republic and Northern Ireland, but this week widened the eligibility to allow anyone who has not received their ballot paper to vote over the phone.

Minister of State for Disabilities and Independent TD Finian McGrath said on Thursday evening that the Green Party will have to learn how to compromise over the term of the next government if the deal passes.

“I think they have to learn that when you go into government, if you are an Independent or someone like the Green Party, you have to learn the c-word. You have to learn to compromise.

“You are going to achieve certain objectives, you are not going to get everything you want. But you will achieve certain things and I would strongly recommend that they go into government because it is a very important place to be and in particular for the debate on climate change and the whole reorganisation of society.

“I think the Greens should go into government. At this late hour I would encourage them to go in because it is in the national interest, we have a Covid crisis, your country needs you. I think they should step up and do it.”

“Too many TDs are sitting on the fence and are not prepared to go into government,” Mr McGrath said.

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar also said last night that he believes the vote will pass with a higher level of support than people expect.

It is expected that both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil will attempt to co-ordinate the announcement of their party ballots to the Green’s announcement on Friday.||0
2020-06-26||TEMPE – Arizonans will face a 14-day quarantine if they travel to New York, New Jersey or Connecticut, whose governors announced the restriction Wednesday to keep people from COVID-19 “hot spots” from bringing the infection with them.

The quarantine, which took effect at midnight Wednesday, applied to nine states with positive virus test rates above 10% or 10 cases per 100,000 residents over a seven-day period. Arizona has been well beyond that threshold for the past three weeks, as the state has regularly set new records for daily infections.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont jointly announced the quarantine Wednesday on travelers from Arizona, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, Utah and Texas.

Cuomo said the three Northeast states, which were hit hard by COVID-19 early in the pandemic, “worked very hard to get the viral transmission rate down” and they want to keep it that way.

“We don’t want to see it go up because a lot of people come into this region and they could literally bring the infection with them,” Cuomo said. “It wouldn’t be malicious or malevolent, but it would still be real.”

Murphy said imposing the quarantine is just “a smart thing to do” to protect their states.

“We have taken our people, the three of us, these three states, through hell and back. The last thing we need to do right now is subject our folks to another round,” he said.

It’s a reversal from April, when infection rates in the Northeast were running high and Arizona imposed travel restrictions on travelers from those states. Aldo Vazquez, spokesperson for AAA Arizona, said “obviously, it’s the 180 now.”

“Back in April, New York, the Northeast was a hot spot and Arizona applied a restriction from travelers in that area,” Vazquez said. “And now we’ve become the hot spot. And we’re seeing the reverse relationship going on here.”

The announcement comes as Arizona has seen cases of COVID-19 skyrocket in recent weeks. There have been 19,048 new cases in the past week, almost a third of the 59,974 cases since the first COVID-19 positive test in the state in late January.

Over the past three weeks, the average number of new cases per day has risen from 993 to 1,257 to 2,385 for the week ended Sunday, a rate of about 32 cases per 100,000 residents. Arizona also posted a new record Wednesday for deaths in a day, with 79 COVID-19 deaths reported.

Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has faced criticism for his decision to relax a stay-home order in May and his refusal to impose a statewide requirement that people wear masks in public. Against the backdrop of soaring cases, however, Ducey last week announced that local governments would be allowed to impose their own mask mandates.

“We have successfully slowed the spread of COVID-19 in the past. We’re going to successfully slow COVID-19 again,” he said then.

Ducey’s office did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday on the quarantine order. But Cuomo cited Arizona as one of the states where he said opening the economy put “people’s lives in jeopardy.”

“And you look at Arizona, you look at Texas, you look at all these states, you know what you see? You see an arrow going up, because it was misguided to say we’re going to reopen the economy,” Cuomo said. “What you’re doing is you’re putting people’s lives in jeopardy, and you’re hurting the economy.”

Vijal Ludlow, co-owner of Awaken Travels, said travelers who are caught in the middle will have to weigh their options.

“I would like to tell travelers if they’re going for leisure purposes to probably wait a little bit longer until we flatten the curve a bit,” Ludlow said. “If it’s an emergency, then we just have to comply with what the state’s requirements are.”

Vazquez said AAA is encouraging people to “check the local and state restrictions, guidelines, anything that may have a destination that you are going to, to make sure that you understand what you’re heading into.”

Those include general health and safety recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department – and may include just canceling your trip, he said.

“The best thing that we can do is follow the guidelines … and right now those guidelines are just, hold off on any non-essential travel, continue practicing social distancing with face masks, and staying home as much as you possibly can,” Vazquez said.||1
2020-06-25||Not only have I been reading about the household cleanouts many did during the pandemic break, but I’ve just seen the impact that had on one of our leading recycling agencies, Hospice Taranaki.

Since lockdown eased, hundreds have descended on hospice locations, especially the big warehouse in Westown, where staff are allowing in only one vehicle a time to prevent being overrun.

The count was 70 cars so far that day when I arrived on Monday afternoon. The main unpacking area was stacked with household items, happily being sorted by a bunch of New Plymouth's Pakeke Lions Club volunteers, whose banter is as sharp as their eyes for resaleable items.

READ MORE:

 * Opshops calling for customers ahead of reopening



This cleverly organised trade is vital for hospices around the country. So tight-arsed have recent governments been about funding this crucial social service, they'd all go broke without income from their shops.

Governments once paid nearly three-quarters of hospice costs, but that proportion has dropped to around half. Either politicians think they're immortal or they just don't see political payoff from being less than miserly.

Hospice people don’t complain about any of that, though; they just get on with it.

And they’re good at managing what has grown into a major semi-commercial operation, with strict standards on what will be accepted into their second-hand shops. Forget about dumping rubbish on them.

Those elements can be managed, but there’s an essential one that comes from outside – volunteers.

While the lockdown in its later stages enabled permanent staff to reorganise the stock, it may also be responsible for a sudden shortage of helpers. I have a suspicion retired people – the subject of much concern during COVID – are still wary about re-emerging to continue their good works.

That will surely pass, despite the inevitable second curve of infections. As it does, social agencies are needing you more than ever, Hospice Taranaki perhaps more than most.

You’re valued for the capabilities your lifetimes have engendered, like culling unsafe electrical appliances, discerning treasure hidden in bric-à-brac, physical strength for lifting furniture and fridges, customer skills, and a plain old willingness to get stuck in and help sort the mountain into valuable components, things that can be sold in the shops and online.

An unspoken benefit (because it seems selfish) may come from donating your time and expertise. None of us can be confident the day won't arrive when we need the tender care provided by Hospice Taranaki's wonderful medical and nursing staff.

I know what they do. I wrote a book about it a few years ago, its soul partly sparked by the way they took care of my Mum in her last days.

That was two decades ago. Rob and I have never forgotten. Dad donated a wooden coat stand for the foyer, made by the incomparable Wally Briggs. It’s still there.

If this all looks uncharacteristically sentimental, then so-be-it. But there's an underlying issue here, one that casts a wide shadow.

Boomers like me have been under attack for being what some call the "selfish generation", one that never fought a world war, got free education to a high level, squandered the planet's resources and accelerated climate change.

That overlooks the fact that we have hard-gained wisdom and wherewithal to give back, and many of us will eschew traditional retirement to stay active and busy…and help out.

Victoria University's Nicholas Agar, a professor of philosophy, has spotted a big flaw in boomer-critics' reasoning.

His post-pandemic analysis notes the main message to older people has been to stay home so the rest of society can get busy fixing the economy. But he says the way our economy is structured, it’s too easy to overlook the contributions of the aged.

"If we can identify these contributions we’ll be less likely to respond to the next crisis by telling them to get out of the way."

The generosity of older volunteers is mostly unknown except to family, friends and the organisations they help, until they either get a gong, an obituary in the paper, or pass on quietly in the manner that typified their lives.

They include people like those who delivered Covid rescue parcels to the less fortunate, and meals-on-wheels troopers who ignored risks to ensure food got through to the many who need it.

A host of Taranaki's voluntary organisations is endangered these days as their governing bodies centralise to Wellington. Let's help keep them local and supported. Like hospice.||1

The carrier announced that its national Ted Rogers Community Grant partners have transitioned all youth programming online this summer. Rogers says the self-directed educational programs aim to fill the gap of cancelled summer camps amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

“School may officially be out, but learning in fun and interesting ways can continue over the summer months,” said Sevaun Palvetzianm, the chief communications officer at Rogers, in a press release.

Canada Learning Code, a recipient of a Ted Rogers Community Grant, will be providing free live online experiences throughout the summer to teach digital literacy through gaming, art and web design.

Non-profit organization Actua is offering a digital library of free programs that explore topics including science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).

“We’re also providing parent and teacher resources, as well as unplugged STEM learning resources for youth in Northern and remote communities who don’t have quality access to technology or broadband,” said Jennifer Flanagan, the present of Actua, in the press release.

2020-06-25||A Fox News host got more than she could handle when she had Greater New York Black Lives matter president Hank Newsome on her show.

Martha McCallum, host of the Fox news show The Story had Newsome on as a guest on Wednesday.

READ MORE: Black Lives Matter protests have not caused increase in COVID-19 cases: research

While Fox is often derided for their biased programming, they do have guests on to presumably present a differing viewpoint or to further explain their position on issues of politics and race. Newsome would appear to be in that category as he was asked to explain the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement.

McCallum started off by asking if the organization promoted violence.

“You … have said that violence is sometimes necessary in these situations. What exactly is it that you hope to achieve through violence?”

“Wow, it’s interesting that you would pose that question like that,” Newsome said. “Because this country is built upon violence. What was the American Revolution, what’s our diplomacy across the globe?

“We go in and we blow up countries and we replace their leaders with leaders who we like. So for any American to accuse us of being violent is extremely hypocritical.”

That was just the opening salvo. McCallum was seemingly taken aback when Newsome respectfully asked to be allowed to complete his explanation when McCallum raised her voice and interrupted him.

Newsome, who wore a ‘Soul Not for Sale’ hat on the show, continued to explain that the Black Lives Matter movement was based on “saving lives, and protecting lives and there’s nothing more American than that.”

He clarified his stance on violence saying, “If this country doesn’t give us what we want, then we will burn down this system and replace it. All right? And I could be speaking … figuratively. I could be speaking literally. It’s a matter of interpretation.”

McCallum was again nonplussed when she was asked about her support for the Second Amendment which gives Americans the right to bear arms. She evaded the question saying it was “not her place here” but did allow that it was a part of the U.S. constitution.

Newsome said while he didn’t condone nor condemn rioting, he did believe it was effective, citing the eight police officers who have been fired since the protests began after the death of George Floyd on Memorial Day.

“Nobody’s talking about ambushing police officers,” Newsome said. “We’re talking about protecting lives. There’s nothing more American than that. We talk about uplifting and upholding the Second Amendment but it seems to be the hypocrisy of America that when Black people start talking about arming themselves and defending themselves, [that] talk is ‘violent’. But when white people grab assault rifles and go to our nation’s, their state capitals, it’s all good.”

McCallum then used a Martin Luther King Jr. quote during his appearance at the Southern Christian Leadership Conference convention in 1967. He made the point that love overcomes all.

“Let us be dissatisfied that day when nobody will shout, ‘White power!’, when nobody will shout, ‘Black power!’, but everybody will talk about God’s power and human power.'”

Newsome’s response to that seemed to fluster the host.

“I love the Lord and my Lord and savior,” Newsome said. “Jesus Christ is the most famous Black radical revolutionary in history. And he was treated just like Dr. King. He was arrested on occasion and he was also crucified or assassinated. This is what happens to black activists. We are killed by the government.”

McCallum, in response to Newsome’s direct question about Jesus’ ethnicity, allowed that as a man from the Middle East, he would have been Middle Eastern, but stopped short of agreeing that he was Black.

2020-06-25||Greetings, and welcome to Interpace Biosciences First Quarter Financial and Business Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available on the Interpace website at www.interpace.com.

During this call, the company will make forward-looking statements. We caution you that any statement that is not a statement of historical fact is a forward-looking statement. This includes remarks about the company's financial projections, expectations, plans, beliefs and prospects. These statements are based on judgment and analysis as of the date of the conference call, and are subject to numerous important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

These risks and uncertainties associated with the forward-looking statements made in the conference call are described in the Safe Harbor statement in today's earnings release, as well as Interpace Biosciences's public periodic filings, including the discussion in the Risk Factor section in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 22, 2020, which includes discussions in the section on forward-looking statements. Investors or potential investors should carefully read and consider these risks. Interpace Biosciences assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or actual outcomes and does not intend to do so.

In addition, the supplement the generally accepted accounting principle or GAAP numbers, we have provided non-GAAP information. We believe that this non-GAAP information provides a meaningful supplemental information and maybe helpful in assessing the company's performance. A table reconciling the GAAP information to non-GAAP information is included in the company's earnings release, which will be available on it’s website.

I'd now like to turn the call over to the President and CEO of Interpace Biosciences, Jack Stover.

Thank you, Diego, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. Fred and I will focus on our first quarter financial progress and provide a general business update. Following that, we will open the call for questions. First quarter revenue was $9.2 million and near the top end of our previously announced revenue range. During the first quarter, we continued to grow our clinical and pharma services businesses. However, our clinical services business was impacted by the pandemic beginning in the second half of March. We also took immediate action to protect our employees from exposure, reduced discretionary and nonessential costs and accelerated operations integration.

Despite seeing improvements through mid-June, we do anticipate the impact of the coronavirus will continue through the remainder of 2020 and perhaps beyond. Our focus for the rest of the year will be continuing to respond to changing conditions, while positioning ourselves for growth and expansion, improving business processes and integrating our service offerings. As mentioned in our earnings release, we are preparing to launch our serology antibody ELISA testing for COVID-19 at our CLIA lab in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We have acquired acceptable kits and reference samples, validation is complete and we are now offering this testing to our employees and customers. Remember the importance of serology testing is to determine who is developing antibodies to the virus, and we believe that this is an important component of the process of reopening workplaces.

Now, I would like to hand the call off to Fred Knechtel, our CFO, to discuss in more detail our financial highlights for the quarter. Fred?

Thank you, Jack and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to focus on key elements of our financial performance and position. As previously mentioned, our first quarter 2020 net revenue was $9.2 million, up 53% from the $6 million in the first quarter of 2019. Clinical services first quarter 2020 net revenue was approximately 60% of total revenue and pharma services was approximately 40%.

In the first quarter of 2019, 100% of our revenue was due to our legacy clinical services, since we did not acquire the BioPharma business of Cancer Genetics until early in the third quarter of 2019. The business was impacted by lower than expected clinical service volume beginning in mid-March, which we believe resulted from the reduction in nonessential testing procedures in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, clinical services gross margin average is in excess of 50%, pharma services gross margin is currently in the low 30% range, and is expected to improve with revenue growth and the success of our planned integration activities.

Total business gross profit for the first quarter of 2020 was $3.1 million and gross margin was 34%. First quarter 2019 gross profit was $3.4 million, while gross margin was 56% and was all related to our legacy clinical services business. Operating expense for the first quarter of 2020 was $9.2 million as compared to $6.7 million in the first quarter of 2019. Operating expenses were lower than the $9.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, resulting from cost initiatives put in place late in the first quarter.

In March, we reduced lab costs, discretionary and non essential spending. We decreased salary, employee wages by 10% to 15% starting in mid April. We expect the operating expense to be further reduced in the second quarter of 2020, while volume is expected to remain at reduced levels. As the benefit of integration activities in the second quarter are realized, we will be reorganizing and streamlining recurring finance and accounting costs in the third and fourth quarter of 2020. It should be noted that integration of the pharma services labs in the latter part of the year may require the temporary addition of resources to support these activities, which we anticipate realizing benefit in the first quarter of 2021 and beyond.

First quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA was negative $4.1 million and first quarter 2019 was negative $1.8 million. The increase of $2.3 million is related principally to the addition of pharma services losses not included in the first quarter of 2019. We used $7.1 million of cash from operating activities as compared to $3 million in the first quarter of 2019. The increased cash was due to $2.3 million of pharma services losses and $1.8 million of increased working capital related to the acquisition.

As of March 31, 2020, our cash balance was $13.4 million with $1.2 million of borrowings under our line of credit with approximately $2.6 million of availability under the line. During the first quarter of 2020, we raised $19.5 million net from the issuance of additional Series B preferred stock, and restructured the previously issued Series A preferred stock, now all under the Series B preferred stock. We also issued approximately point $0.4 million net of common stock under our ATM and paid down $1.8 million under our bank line of credit.

In April 2020, we received a $650,000 grant from the Department of Health and Human Services related to the COVID-19 virus and antibody testing, and a $2.1 million cash advance for future Medicare billing reimbursements. As of June 17, 2020, we had a cash position of approximately $16.2 million and borrowings under our line of credit amounting to $3.4 million. To optimize the pharma services lab operations, we are transitioning lab work from Rutherford, New Jersey to our state-of-the-art led facility in Morrisville, North Carolina. We will be investing to facilitate the move, transfer personnel, build out facilities and validate processes over the next several months. We are confident this investment will transition, and transition will result in reduced operating costs and providing more robust platform for our customers in the future.

With that, let me turn the call back over to Jack for his closing statements.

Thanks, Fred. During June, we are seeing that our business, while down approximately 30% from where we were just prior to the pandemic hitting, is recovering nicely and largely as we anticipated. We feel that the worst is behind us. However, there is still much uncertainty related to the coronavirus pandemic. We are pleased to announce the launch of our serology testing to assist in transitioning back to normal. We do believe that one of the important global impacts of the pandemic is an increased awareness of the importance of the role diagnostics play. We're confident that we are well positioned to take advantage of this opportunity with our diversification, focusing on improving diagnosis and customize assay solutions for physicians, patients and pharmaceutical and biotech companies developing products.

At this time, due to uncertainty we are not in a position to provide you with a confident revenue projection for the remainder of 2020. However, we are projecting net revenue for the second quarter of 2020 to be between $5.5 million and $6 million.

Now let me turn the call over to Diego for Q&A.

Thank you, sir [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please state your question.

So, I wanted to drill down a little bit as far as, Fred, you have some commentary on the OpEx for, was that Q2 or the year? Can you give us a little better flavor on Q2 versus Q1 on the OpEx and how that comes out and then, for the balance of the year? And then also, can you correlate that with margins for the second quarter and then coming out or up, how do you that looks for the back half of the year?

So operating expense was $9.5 million in fourth quarter of 2019, and we reduced that to $9.2 million with some of the actions that we took later in the quarter. And then we expect that with the actions that we have in place that operating expense will be d||2
2020-06-25||JUNEAU, Alaska - A federal magistrate judge has dismissed a criminal contempt complaint against a man who prosecutors had accused of violating a judge’s order and breaking Alaska quarantine rules following his early release from prison amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Chief U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah M. Smith this week granted a request by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Anchorage to dismiss the case against Duane Byron Fields. Prosecutors in their request cited testimony from Daniel Poulson, an assistant federal defender who had represented Fields.

Poulson had successfully petitioned to have Fields’ sentence in a drug-related case reduced and secured his early release from a prison in California that had been hit hard by the coronavirus. A judge’s May 6 order granting the request cited the need for Fields to follow quarantine and other measures upon release.

But Poulson said he didn’t believe Fields received that order. Fields was released from Federal Correctional Institution Terminal Island in California on May 8, according to court records.

Poulson did not notify the prison of the order or speak with Fields about it, according to Smith’s ruling, which also says Poulson testified he had not had any phone calls with Fields since March due to contact and visitation restrictions at the prison.

Fields testified that because of the restrictions, he did not speak to anyone outside the prison between the end of March and his release, her ruling states.

“The evidence does not show there is probable cause to believe Fields’s disobedience of the order was wilful,” Smith wrote.

Poulson, in response to a request for comment, confirmed to The Associated Press that he did not speak to Fields about the May 6 order or its conditions before Fields’ release.

Chloe Martin, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Anchorage, by email said the admission by the federal defender’s office “is especially concerning given the urgency to self-quarantine during a pandemic, and not only for their client’s sake, but for the health and safety of our community.”

Cindy Franklin, a private attorney appointed to represent Fields in the contempt case in place of the federal defender agency, said prosecutors are trying to blame Poulson when they brought a shoddy case. She called the dismissal the “right result.”

Fields, who has battled cancer, was granted compassionate release by Senior U.S. District Judge James K. Singleton Jr. Singleton, in his May 6 order, said the court “may fashion an appropriate sanction” should Fields fail to follow quarantine or social distancing measures or any other condition of release.

Alaska then required people arriving in the state to quarantine for 14 days to help guard against spreading the coronavirus. Under quarantine, people are to leave their location only for medical emergencies or care.

Singleton’s order stated the probation office was OK with Fields staying with his mother but noted she would require him to quarantine elsewhere first. Poulson indicated Fields could quarantine at an Anchorage hotel where Fields’ daughter worked.

Smith, in her ruling, said when Fields boarded his flight for Anchorage, he carried a notice of release from the U.S. Department of Justice stating he was to be taken to his mother’s home. He went there first, but later went to the hotel when his daughter came to get him. His daughter testified she had not had a chance to tell him about staying at the hotel before he returned to Alaska.

Smith said there were differences in the accounts of Fields and his daughter and that of Probation Officer Timothy Astle, including whether Fields was allowed to go to his mother’s to get clothing. Astle said during calls with Fields there was buffering and periods of poor reception.

Astle found Fields at his mother’s on May 11, when he learned Fields had tested positive for COVID-19 at the prison.

Franklin has said the test came back positive the day before Fields was allowed to travel to Alaska but no one told Fields the result.

The magistrate judge, Smith, said Fields’ family members tested negative and there was no evidence he infected anyone.

Martin said officials continue to monitor Fields’ compliance with conditions of his supervision. Franklin said federal officials seem “absolutely determined that he is going to fail“ when the probation department “has a responsibility to try to help him succeed.”||1
2020-09-09||BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s acting Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello said on Tuesday that a COVID-19 vaccine would be rolled out for all Brazilians in January 2021.

“We are closing contracts with vaccine manufacturers and the forecast is that a vaccine will arrive for us starting in January next year and we will start vaccinating everyone,” Eduardo Pazuello said in a video posted to social media.

Pazuello and other ministers were responding to questions from Esther Castilho, a 10-year-old YouTuber wearing a cowboy hat. Pazuello did not give details on which vaccine would be rolled out.

Brazil has the third-worst outbreak of coronavirus globally with more than 4.1 million cases, passed this week by India for the second highest number of cases after the United States. More than 127,000 people have died from the disease, according to the official Health Ministry death toll.

The high number of cases has led several vaccine makers to seek out Brazil for clinical trials. The country is testing a potential vaccine from AstraZeneca AZN.L and has signed a memorandum of understanding to receive 30 million doses of it.

Right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, who has downplayed the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, on Tuesday repeated prior statements that vaccination would not be mandatory, although the government would still mount a vaccine campaign.

“People cannot be injected with whatever, or forced,” Bolsonaro said in an afternoon event with Brazilian doctors.||1
2020-09-09||CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Tuesday proposed administering a Russian coronavirus vaccine to nearly 15,000 candidates in upcoming legislative elections so that they can campaign safely.

Russia in August licensed a COVID-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing, a move celebrated by Moscow but questioned by some experts who note that only about 10% of clinical trials are successful.

Maduro’s adversaries are broadly planning to boycott the Dec. 6 vote on the grounds that it is rigged in favor of the ruling Socialist Party, although one faction of the opposition has opened talks with the government to seek vote guarantees.

“It would be a good idea to give the Russian vaccine to the 14,400 candidates who have registered ... so that they can carry out their electoral campaign more comfortably,” Maduro said during a televised address.

He said that in September, some Russian vaccines would arrive for clinical trials, and that in October “other vaccines” would arrive, without elaborating.

Russia’s “Sputnik-V” COVID-19 vaccine produced an antibody response in all participants in early-stage trials, according to results published on Friday by The Lancet medical journal, which noted that long-term trials were still necessary.

Kirill Dmitriev of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, which has backed the vaccine, said at least 3,000 people had already been recruited for the large-scale Sputnik-V trial, and that initial results were expected in October or November.

That trial involves some 40,000 participants, the sovereign wealth fund said in August.||0
2020-09-09||SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia is not worried about AstraZeneca Plc’s decision to put on hold its COVID-19 vaccine trial, its deputy chief medical officer said on Wednesday, as daily cases nudged higher in the country’s coronavirus hot spot.

AstraZeneca on Tuesday said it has paused a late-stage trial of one of the leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates after an unexplained illness in a study participant.

The nature of the case and when it happened were not detailed, although the participant is expected to recover, according to Stat News, which first reported the news.

“With the information that I have got at the moment, I am not worried about it,” Australia’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer Nick Coatsworth told Sky News, adding the hold on trials does not mean the vaccine “is off the table”.

“In some respects, this is a very positive thing because it shows that despite the accelerated vaccine development, safety is the priority of the clinical trialists and investigators.”

Coatsworth said Australia like many other governments has invested in several coronavirus vaccine candidates, “knowing not all of them will get through”.

AstraZeneca’s decision to place the trial on hold comes after a pledge from nine leading U.S. and European vaccine developers on Tuesday to uphold scientific safety and efficacy standards for their vaccines despite the urgency to contain the pandemic.

Australia on Monday said it would get the first doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine in January 2021 if trials proved successful after reaching a preliminary deal in August.

It had also signed an agreement on a COVID-19 vaccine being developed by the University of Queensland. Both these vaccines will be manufactured locally by CSL Ltd.

Australia’s coronavirus hot spot of Victoria on Wednesday, meanwhile, reported its biggest rise in daily cases in three days as the state boosted its contact tracing programme to ease the spread of the virus.

Victoria, which is at the centre of Australia’s second wave of coronavirus outbreak, now accounts for about 75% of Australia’s 26,450 COVID-19 cases and 90% of its 781 deaths.

The state reported 76 new cases and 11 deaths from the virus in the last 24 hours.||0
2020-09-09||BENGALURU, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Indian shares opened lower on Wednesday after a sell-off in U.S. technology stocks roiled Asian markets, while drug maker AstraZeneca’s India unit fell up to 12.3% after the parent paused global trials of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine.

The blue-chip NSE Nifty 50 index fell 0.71% to 11,236.90, while the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex was down 0.64% to 38,117.09 by 0349 GMT.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 1.12%, after heavyweight technology stocks were hammered overnight on Wall Street, sending the Nasdaq into correction territory.

Sentiment was also dampened after AstraZeneca plc paused late-stage trials of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed with the University of Oxford, widely seen as of one of the leading vaccine candidates against the coronavirus.

Almost all major sectors were trading lower, with the Nifty bank index falling 1.07% and the Nifty energy index shedding 1.09%.

2020-09-09||TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s currency in circulation and bank deposits rose at a record annual pace in August as companies and households continued to pile up cash to guard against the coronavirus- driven income slump, central bank data showed on Wednesday.

The data underlines the difficulty of prodding companies and households to start spending again, even as the economy gradually re-opens after lockdown measures were lifted in May.

Japan’s M3 money stock - or currency in circulation and deposits at financial institutions - rose 7.1% in August from a year earlier, marking the biggest increase since comparable data became available in 2004, Bank of Japan data showed. The rise topped a 6.5% gain in July.

Bank deposits surged a record 15.3% in August from a year earlier, as the hit to sales from COVID-19 prompted companies to continue to hoard cash as a precaution.

Cash in circulation rose 5.5% in August, matching the pace of gain in July, the data showed.

“Some households may be holding cash at home instead of parking them in bank accounts, as the pandemic makes them cautious of visiting bank branches, a BOJ official told a briefing.

Japan’s economy sank deeper into its worst postwar contraction in the second quarter as the coronavirus jolted businesses more than initially thought, data showed on Tuesday, underscoring the daunting task policymakers face in averting a steeper recession.||1
2020-09-09||TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil futures fell again on Wednesday after a sharp slide in the previous session, as a rebound in COVID-19 cases in some countries undermined hopes for a steady recovery in global demand.

Brent crude LCOc1 was down 25 cents, or 0.6%, at $39.53 a barrel by 0455 GMT after dropping more than 5% on Tuesday to fall below $40 a barrel for the first time since June.

U.S. crude CLc1 was down 28 cents, or 0.8%, at $36.48 a barrel, having fallen nearly 8% in the previous session.

Both major oil benchmarks are trading at around three month lows.

The global health crisis continues to flare unabated with cases rising in India, Great Britain, Spain and several parts of the United States.

The outbreak is threatening hopes for a global economic recovery that could reduce demand for fuels from aviation gas to diesel, although the price slump could lift refinery profits back into positive territory, Eurasia said in a note.

“That would be a major move and potentially a sign for the industry that the crude production and processing capacity reductions have finally met their goal in adjusting the industry in line with lower demand,” it said.

Record supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+ have helped support prices, but with grim economic figures being reported almost daily, the outlook for demand for oil remains bleak.

China’s factory gate prices fell for a seventh straight month in August although at the slowest annual pace since March, suggesting industries in the world’s second-biggest economy continued their recovery from the coronavirus-induced downturn.||1
2020-09-09||PARIS (Reuters) - The number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in France rose by 6,544 over the last 24 hours to give a total of 335,524 cases, the health ministry said on Tuesday, as the country battles to avert a second wave of the virus.

The number of deaths also climbed by 39 over the last 24 hours to reach a total of 30,764.

France has the world’s seventh-highest COVID-19 death toll, and authorities are scrutinising the data to see what measures might be needed to help it cope with an expected second wave of the virus this winter.

The government has said that while it will do all it can to avoid another nationwide lockdown, such as that imposed across the country from March to May, it will nevertheless keep all its options open.

Health Minister Olivier Veran said earlier on Tuesday that the COVID-19 situation was worrying, although he felt a big second wave of infections could be avoided.

“The reproduction rate of the virus stands at 1.2 which is less than the 3.2-3.4 level seen during the spring. So the virus is spreading at lesser speed but it is circulating, which is worrying”, Veran told France Inter radio.||1
2020-09-09||AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordanian authorities confirmed the first two cases of coronavirus in a refugee camp hosting Syrian refugees since the pandemic was first reported in the kingdom, the U.N refugee agency said on Tuesday.

The two Syrians who were transferred to an isolation site tested positive during random testing done by Jordanian health authorities in the Azraq camp, said Rula Amin, UNHCR spokeswoman for the Middle East and North Africa.

There have been several other infections of Syrian refugees living outside the camps, among around 2,500 cases in Jordan since the first was reported on March 2, Amin said.

Most of the 655,000 United Nations-registered Syrian refugees live in urban centres.

A majority of Syrian refugees who fled their homeland since the start of the nearly decade long conflict in 2011 have remained in Jordan.||1
2020-09-09||(Reuters) - Several states in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast have seen new COVID-19 cases increase for two weeks in a row, though nationally both new infections and deaths last week remained on a downward trend, a Reuters analysis showed.

The United States reported more than 287,000 new cases in the week ended Sept. 6, down 1.4% from the previous week and marking the seventh straight week of declines. More than 5,800 people died from COVID-19 last week, the third week in a row that the death rate has fallen.

Nevertheless, 17 states have seen cases rise for at least two weeks, according to the Reuters tally of state and county reports. They include Missouri, North Dakota and Wisconsin, where between 10% and 18% of people tested had the new coronavirus.

In the Northeast, Delaware, New Hampshire, New Jersey and New York also reported increases in new cases for at least two weeks, though the positive test rate ranged from a low of 0.9% in New York to a high of 4.3% in Delaware -- below the 5% level the World Health Organization considers concerning.

In some states, testing has increased as schools reopened. New York City, for instance, is testing 10% to 20% of students and staff every month. The University of Illinois is testing students twice a week.

Nationally, the share of all tests that came back positive for COVID-19 fell for a fifth week to 5.5%, well below a peak of nearly 9% in mid-July, according to data from The COVID Tracking Project, a volunteer-run effort to track the outbreak.

The United States tested on average 741,000 people a day last week, up 5% from the prior week, but down from a peak in late July of over 800,000 people a day.

2020-09-09||HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe will resume domestic flights from Thursday and international flights next month in a boost to tourism, but travellers will be required to have COVID-19 clearance certificates, the government said.

The Southern African nation suspended flights and shut its borders in March as it sought to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected 7,388 people and resulted in 218 deaths.

The government said in a statement that domestic flights would resume on Sept. 10, while international flights would start on Oct. 1.

“All travellers will be required to have a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) COVID-19 clearance certificate issued by a recognised facility within 48 hours from the date of departure,” the statement said.

A COVID-19 lockdown has until now closed all tourist attractions, forcing some hotels and resorts to lay off workers. The government expects the tourism sector to contract 7.4% this year.||1
2020-09-09||(Reuters) - New York will require kindergarten through 12th grade schools to disclose the number of students and staff testing positive for COVID-19 and may force colleges with more than 100 cases to switch to remote learning, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday.

Cuomo said the regulations would provide a check on the procedures put in place by colleges and give parents transparency about testing at elementary through high schools.

“You have all your protocols. That’s nice,” Cuomo told a news conference. “If the state sees a cluster - just like colleges, just like workplaces, just like restaurants - we see a cluster in a school we are going to come in, override everything.”

Cuomo criticized the administration of New York University for not preventing a large gathering of students in nearby Washington Square Park in New York City on Saturday night, and listed several other colleges in the state that have had spikes in COVID-19 cases.

He said colleges must now report to the state’s health department when they have in excess of 100 cases, a threshold that would require a shift to remote classes unless there were extenuating circumstances.

“Colleges across the country are seeing outbreaks,” he said. “This is going to be a problem.”

Cuomo, a Democrat, also accused Republican President Donald Trump of “trying to kill New York City” by not approving infrastructure projects and not advocating for federal aid to states to deal with the economic fallout from the pandemic.

Earlier on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Republican leaders will introduce a proposal for additional coronavirus relief on Tuesday. The proposal is expected to have a far smaller scope than the $3 trillion bill passed in the Democratic-led House of Representatives in May.

Cuomo said the president and the Senate would court economic disaster if they did not approve federal aid to states.

“If they don’t provide a response the national economy will suffer for years,” he said.||0
2020-09-09||LONDON (Reuters) - British firms hired temporary staff in August at the fastest pace since the end of 2018 as they tried to recover from the COVID-19 lockdown but remained wary of the pandemic and the Brexit impasse, a recruiters industry group said.

There was also a jump in the availability of candidates which rose at the second-steepest rate in over 20 years, reflecting redundancies announced by many companies in Britain.

Billings from temporary hirings rose for the first time in seven months, the Recruitment & Employment Confederation and accountants KPMG said on Wednesday.

Employers typically rely on temporary workers at times of economic uncertainty.

There was also a rise in billings from companies hiring permanent workers in August but the increase was worryingly small, the REC said.

“It reflects the uncertainty businesses face about what will happen over coming months with the pandemic and Brexit,” Neil Carberry, the chief executive of the REC, said.

Carberry urged the government to settle its differences with the European Union and strike a trade deal.

The survey’s gauge of demand for staff deteriorated in August after three months of improvement.

Britain looks set for a sharp rise in unemployment as the government winds down its emergency coronavirus job retention scheme by the end of next month.

Carberry called on the government to cut employers’ social contribution requirements and offer them more help with skills training.||1
2020-08-12|"The Oura Ring has been getting a lot of attention lately because of its role in a number of COVID-19 studies, as well as its adoption by both the NBA and WNBA as a potential tool for helping prevent any outbreaks of the novel coronavirus as those two leagues get back to a regular schedule of play. Oura has released multiple generations of the Ring, which is a health and fitness tracker that reports a range of data, and I’ve spent the past month using one to see what all the fuss is about.

The Oura Ring is a health tracker that’s unlike just about any other wearable with a similar purpose. It’s a ring that’s virtually indistinguishable from an actual ring without any smart features, available in a couple of different designs and multiple finishes. The Ring has sensors located on the inside surface, but these barely add to its overall thickness and are totally hidden when the ring is worn.

Despite its small size and low profile, the Oura Ring is still a connected device, with an internal battery, and the ability to talk to a smartphone via Bluetooth to transmit the data its sensors collect. In the box, you also get a USB-C stand for the Oura Ring that powers it up via induction charging.

The built-in battery is good for up to seven days of continuous use — and that includes wearing the Oura Ring during sleep. During my usage, that seemed to be an accurate estimate. In general, though, the battery life just seemed to be “long enough,” prompting me not to really think about specific spans, and charging is so quick that it’s easy to just remember to put it on the dock occasionally when it’s convenient (I would often do this during the work day while at my desk, where I keep the Oura dock). Oura’s app also sends helpful notifications to remind you to charge before bed when you’re getting close to the end of your ring’s battery life.

Oura’s design for this most recent iteration of their Ring is fantastic — both as just a piece of jewelry and doubly so as a connected health and activity tracker. It’s available in two styles, called “Balance” and “Heritage,” both of which come in multiple metallic finishes. There’s a polished silver and gloss black option for both, while “Balance” has a premium-priced version with inlaid diamonds, and “Heritage” has a matte black finish option (which I reviewed).

All the various finishes ore made of a lightweight titanium, with a molded plastic inner to protect the sensors and provide transparency for them to work. The exterior finishes are all coated with a scratch-resistant outer layer — but like with just about any other metal jewelry, scratch-resistant isn’t scratch-proof. The matte black finish I reviewed is definitely showing some wear and tear after multiple weeks of use, but that’s something I was fully expecting, and it’s surprisingly resilient, given how often it comes in contact with other metal surfaces, stone and whatever else you come in contact with on a daily basis. The minor blemishes that appear lend it a pleasing patina, rather than negatively impacting its aesthetics, in my opinion.

The Oura Ring is also fixed in terms of sizing and fit, and the company has come up with a clever way to handle ensuring a good fit for customers. They offer a free sizing kit that they ship out first so you can figure out which Oura size is most comfortable, and decide on which finger you want to wear it. Size is important because you want the Oura Ring to fit snugly enough that it won’t fall off or shift around too much, but also not too snugly that it becomes uncomfortable.

Ultimately, the design is fantastic because it’s both an attractive ring, and an incredibly comfortable device to wear all day — and through the night. Unlike even an Apple Watch or other wrist-worn wearable, there’s virtually no adjustment required for getting used to wearing it while sleeping, or any discomfort from various types of bands. It’s the first wearable I’ve used where I truly was able to forget that I was wearing one at all, and it’s one that no one else will realize you’re wearing, either.

So what does the Oura Ring actually track? A lot of things, actually. It measures sleep, as mentioned, as well as various other metrics under two broad categories: Readiness and Activity. Sleep, Readiness and Activity all provide one overall summary score out of 100 to give you a topline sense of where you are, but each is actually calculated from a range of sub-metrics that add up to that larger score.

Oura’s sleep tracking is much more in-depth than the forthcoming Apple Watch sleep tracking that Apple is releasing with its next watchOS update in the fall. It monitors when you go to sleep, how long you sleep, how much of that qualifies as “deep” and how much is “REM,” and gives you a metric or you sleep efficiency, your time in bed, your total sleep time and more. Readiness tracks your ambient body temperature, heart rate variability, respiratory rate and your resting heart rate, while activity automatically measures calorie burn, inactive time, your steps and how close you are to your overall activity goal.

For all three of these categories, you can dive into each individual sub-metric and see trends over time or individual scores per day, but you also can just look at the overall score, which is provided in a feed-like dashboard in the app and accompanied by practical, actionable advise about what to do with your day, your activity or your sleep habits based on that score and how it’s trending.

It’s at once both the easiest to understand health tracking app I’ve used, and also one of those with the most depth when it comes to digging into what is actually being tracked, and what that means in greater detail. And because the app focuses heavily on establishing a baseline and then monitoring deviations from that baseline and providing advice based on that, it’s more likely to be useful and specifically relevant to you.

With most wearable tech, including the Apple Watch, I periodically have a sort of internal revolt where I end up finding them too much of an intrusion, or too much of a hassle to maintain continuous use. With the Oura Ring, health self-monitoring reaches a perfect pinnacle of combining convenience with useful and actionable information, with an unobtrusive and attractive design that actually makes me want to put it on.

The jury remains out on whether the Oura Ring can actually accurately detect COVID-19 or anticipate the onset of its symptoms, but regardless, it’s a fantastic personal health tracking device and a great tool for anyone looking to take more control over how they feel on a daily basis. And by actively establishing an individual baseline and comparing your actual overall state to that every day, Oura provides one of the best potential platforms for long-term personal wellness insight out there."|2
2020-08-12|"Joe Biden’s decision to name California Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate in the quest to unseat President Trump means that the next vice president could be not only the first Black and Asian American woman on a presidential ticket in the U.S — historic milestones by any account — but also a Californian who built a career in the tech industry’s front yard.

Born in Oakland, Harris served as San Francisco district attorney and later as the attorney general for California before being elected to the Senate in 2016. And while the newly named vice presidential nominee is likely to bring a deeper understanding of the tech industry to the race, her positions on how a Democratic administration should approach tech’s most powerful companies during an unprecedented moment of scrutiny aren’t exactly crystal clear.

Harris attracted considerable support from Silicon Valley executives in her bid for the Democratic nomination, outpacing other candidates in donations from employees from large tech companies early on. While that support shifted around throughout the race and many donors in tech supported multiple candidates, the industry is likely to be happy with Biden’s selection.

Notably, Harris was elected as California attorney general in 2010 and served two terms, overseeing the tech industry through a large portion of its most explosive growth — a measure that likely proves more meaningful in assessing her stance toward regulating the tech industry than the things she said along the campaign trail.

Still, those were arguably simpler times for Silicon Valley, and ones that predated current hot-button conversations around issues like election interference, misinformation wars and antitrust enforcement.

As the primary developed and then-rival Elizabeth Warren carved out a posture critical of big tech, Harris seldom waded into thorny issues around regulating the tech industry. During an October debate, Harris avoided a question asking about concerns over second order effects if big tech companies were broken up, instead redirecting to the safer political territory of Trump’s Twitter account. Dodging meatier points about tech accountability, Harris called on Twitter to suspend the president’s account for violating its rules, calling the issue “a matter of safety and corporate accountability.”

Earlier this year, in response to a straightforward question asking if companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon should be broken up, Harris again dodged, though signaled that she is concerned in how those companies handle user data.

“I believe that tech companies have got to be regulated in a way that we can ensure the American consumer can be certain that their privacy is not being compromised,” Harris said. Harris also expressed her concerns about user privacy in a 2018 Twitter thread.

“Millions of Americans have no idea how much data Facebook is collecting, from tracking their location and IP address, to following their activities on other websites,” she wrote.

“In the real world, this would be like someone watching what you do, where you go, for how long, and with whom you’re with every day. For most, it would feel like an invasion of privacy.”

In other critiques of tech, Harris has mostly concentrated on Facebook, denouncing its role in spreading Russian disinformation during the 2016 presidential race and expressing worries over how the company handles the data it collects.

When given the chance to press Mark Zuckerberg in person, Harris zeroed in on the company’s handling of the Cambridge Analytica data misuse to its users. More recently, Harris co-authored a letter to Facebook along with Colorado Senator Michael Bennett after the audit’s largely unflattering results were published, pressing the company on election concerns.

“Although the company has shown a recent willingness to rein in disinformation with respect to COVID-19, it has not shown equal resolve to confront voter suppression and learn the lessons of the 2016 election,” the senators wrote. “We share the auditors’ concern that Facebook has failed to use the tools and resources at its disposal to more vigorously combat voter suppression and protect civil rights.”

In another letter to the company, Harris criticized Facebook’s fact-checking policies for climate-related misinformation in light of a New York Times report.

In spite of the harsh talk, Harris seems to be on fairly friendly terms with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, who congratulated her on the nomination Tuesday. Back in 2013, Harris apparently contributed to the marketing effort around Sandberg’s now-ubiquitous book Lean In, sharing her own story. Harris also spoke at a cyberbullying event hosted at Facebook’s Menlo Park headquarters in 2015 and the two were photographed onstage together.

While we have a handful of public statements from Harris about her views on tech, there’s plenty more that we don’t know. The way she positioned herself in relation to other candidates during the primary might not wholly reflect the kind of priorities she would bring to the vice presidency, and we’ll likely be learning more about those in the coming days.

Right now there are many, many crises on the table for the next administration. If regulating big tech looked like a huge campaign issue back in the pre-pandemic political landscape of 2020, conversations around police brutality and the devastating American failure to contain the coronavirus are now at the fore. Whether issues around antitrust regulation and reining in tech’s power will make it off the back burner remains to be seen, and there are plenty of national five-alarm fires to be put out in the meantime.

While her potential position as the nation’s next vice president doesn’t mean that Harris would be tasked with shaping tech policy or spearheading antitrust efforts, her deep connections to tech’s geographic hub could prove consequential in a Biden presidency and its priorities.

In spite of some question marks around her policy approaches, Harris is a known quantity for the tech industry — one who understands Silicon Valley and who, per her track record, doesn’t look keen to take on the industry’s biggest companies in spite of some recent tough talk. Whatever tech policies emerge out of a Biden/Harris campaign, the fresh vice presidential nominee is connected to tech in a more meaningful way than any other contender for the spot. That alone is something to watch."|0
2020-08-12|"Facebook said Tuesday it can’t moderate its own site or its subsidiary Instagram as effectively as possible for certain categories of rule violations during the novel coronavirus pandemic, while almost nobody got the chance to appeal its moderators’ decisions in the second quarter of 2020.



Per the latest version of its Community Standards Enforcement Report, which covers the Q2 period of April 2020 to June 2020, Facebook took action on 1.7 million pieces of content that violated its policies on suicide and self-injury in Q1, but just 911,000 in Q2. (That number is down from 5 million in Q4 2019.) While enforcement against content in violation of Facebook policies on child nudity and sexual exploitation rose from 8.6 million to 9.5 million, it was way down on Instagram, where the number fell from around 1 million to just over 479,000. Enforcement of rules prohibiting suicide and self-injury content on Instagram also plummeted from 1.3 million actions in Q1 to 275,000 actions in Q2. Instagram increased enforcement against graphic and violent content, but on Facebook that category fell from 25.4 million actions in Q1 to 15.1 million actions in Q2.

Facebook Vice President of Integrity Guy Rosen wrote in a blog post that the lower number of actions taken was the direct result of the coronavirus, as enforcing rules in those categories requires increased human oversight. The company’s long-suffering force of content moderators, many of whom are contractors, can’t do their job well or at all from home, according to Rosen:

The report didn’t offer estimates of the prevalence of violent, graphic, or adult nudity and sexual activity on Facebook or Instagram, with Rosen claiming that the company “prioritized removing harmful content over measuring certain efforts.”

The Facebook appeals process, by which users can challenge a moderation decision, has also flatlined to near-zero levels in every category. The company previously announced in July that with moderators out of the office, it would give users who want to appeal “the option to tell us that they disagree with our decision and we’ll monitor that feedback to improve our accuracy, but we likely won’t review content a second time.”

Facebook took action on a far larger number of posts for violating rules against hate speech in Q2 (22.5 million, up from 9.6 million in Q1). It wrote in the report that automated machine learning tools now find 94.5 percent of the hate speech the company ends up taking down, something it attributed to support for more languages (English, Spanish, and Burmese). Enforcement against organized hate group content fell (4.7 million to 4 million) while that against terrorism content rose (6.3 million to 8.7 million).

Curiously, the amount of content that was later restored without an appeal after being removed under the anti-organized hate and terrorism rules skyrocketed in Q2; Facebook restored 135,000 posts in the first category and 533,000 in the second. It doesn’t appear that Facebook processed a single appeal on either category in Q2, suggesting the company’s human moderators have their eyes turned elsewhere. Facebook does not release the internal data which may show how prevalent hate speech or organized hate groups are on the site.

Keep in mind that this is all according to Facebook, which has recently faced accusations it turns a blind eye to rule violations that are politically inconvenient as well as an employee walkout and advertiser boycott pressuring the company to do more about hate speech and misinformation. By definition, the report only shows the prohibited content that Facebook is already aware of. Independent assessments of the company’s handling of issues like hate speech haven’t always reflected Facebook’s insistence that progress is being made.

A civil rights audit released in July 2020 that found it failed to build a civil rights infrastructure and made “vexing and heartbreaking” choices that have actively caused “significant setbacks for civil rights.” A United Nations report in 2019 assessed Facebook’s reaction to accusations of complicity in the genocide of the Rohingya people in Myanmar as slow and subpar, in particular calling out the company for not doing enough to remove racist content on the site quickly or prevent it from behind uploaded in the first place. (It’s possible that some of the surge in hate speech on Facebook is due to the introduction of more tools to detect in Burmese, the majority language of Myanmar.)

It remains broadly unclear just how well Facebook’s AI tools are doing their job. Seattle University associate professor Caitlin Carlson told Wired hate speech is “not hard to find” on the site, and the 9.6 million posts Facebook said it removed for hate speech in Q1 2020 seemed very low. In January 2020, Carlson and a colleague published results of an experiment in which they assembled 300 posts they believed would violate company standards and reported them to Facebook moderators, who took only about half of them down. Groups dedicated to conspiracy theories, such as the far-right QAnon one, continue to run rampant on the site and have millions of members. Facebook, as well as other social media sites, also played a major role in the spread of coronavirus misinformation this year.

Many of Facebook’s moderators have begun to return to work. According to VentureBeat, Facebook said that it is working to see how its metrics can be audited “most effectively,” and said that it is calling for an external, independent audit of Community Standards Enforcement Report data that it expects to begin in 2021."|1
2020-08-12|"Billy Woods, the sheriff of central Florida’s Marion County, banned masks for all deputies and visitors to the sheriff’s office starting Tuesday, according to a new report from the Ocala Star Banner—a strange decision to make in the middle of a pandemic that’s still wildly out of control.

Sheriff Woods has instructed staff not to wear masks while on duty and said that any public visitors to the sheriff’s office, which currently employs about 900 people, should be told that masks are banned. Anyone who doesn’t want to remove their mask will be told to leave, according to a memo written by Woods and obtained by the Ocala Star Banner.

“Effective immediately, any individual walking in to any one of our lobbies (which includes the main office and all district offices) that is wearing a mask will be asked to remove it,” Woods wrote.

Masks are a vital public health tool to help slow the spread of coronavirus, according to the CDC, and the sheriff’s mask ban comes as Florida broke a new record for daily deaths from covid-19. The Sunshine State recorded 277 new deaths on Tuesday, with 13 of those deaths in Marion County. The U.S. as a whole reported 1,339 new deaths yesterday.

Woods cited anti-police sentiment as one reason for the new ban, strongly hinting that someone might enter the sheriff’s office for nefarious purposes and be unidentifiable with a mask.

Woods wrote, “in light of the current events when it comes to the sentiment and/or hatred toward law enforcement in our country today, this is being done to ensure there is clear communication and for identification purposes of any individual walking into a lobby.”

Florida has seen a dramatic rise in coronavirus cases over the past few months, with children being particularly hard hit. The number of Florida children under 17 who’ve tested positive for covid-19 rose from 16,797 kids on July 9 to 39,735 on August 9, according to a recent report from CNN. Overall, Florida has identified more than 543,000 cases and 8,552 deaths.

Masks were somewhat controversial in the U.S. medical community during the early days of the pandemic, but health experts in Asia immediately recognized that face coverings could play an important role in stopping the spread of the disease. It’s now widely accepted in the U.S. that masks are a public good and should be widely adopted to help contained covid-19, though Republicans tend to be the most skeptical of masks, according to several polls. President Donald Trump has also been a mask skeptic, though recently pulled a 180 and called mask wearing “patriotic.”

Florida currently has a positivity testing rate of 17.3%, according to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker, a number that indicates the pandemic is still raging out of control in the state. New York’s positivity rate is currently under 1%, which means that virus is still present, but not nearly as prevalent as places like Mississippi (20.5%) and Texas (20.4%).

Anti-mask sentiment in Florida appears to be high, relative to many other parts of the country. Recently, an anti-mask protest in central Florida made headlines for being an absurd display of stupidity. Ocala, the largest city in Marion County, passed a mandatory mask ordinance last week through its city council, but the mayor, Kent Guinn, vetoed the new order on Monday, according to local ABC TV affiliate WCJB.

Guinn insists that his constituents don’t want a mask ordinance for local businesses, even one that just states businesses should make a “reasonable effort” to get customers to wear face coverings.

“Most want me to veto it. Probably 99 plus percent,” Guinn told WCJB last week.

Marion County went for Donald Trump in 2016, with 61.7% voting for the current president, and 35.5% voting for Hillary Clinton. So while it’s unlikely that “99%” of Guinn’s constituents oppose masks, it’s not hard to believe that a majority might believe the conspiracy theories that masks are a secret plot by the world’s lizard people to make you breathe poison."|0
2020-08-12|"(CNN) Coronavirus continues to spread at high rates across the US South, Midwest and West, even as the total number of new Covid-19 cases has declined since a summer surge.

Nationally, over the last seven days, the US is averaging just under 53,000 new cases of Covid-19 per day, down 11% from the week prior.

As a result of all those cases, deaths from the virus have remained high. The seven-day average of daily coronavirus deaths was just over 1,000 on Tuesday, the 16th consecutive day the US averaged over 1,000 deaths per day.

Adjusting for population, states in the Southeast are seeing the most new cases. Georgia and Florida -- states led by Republican governors who have not issued face mask requirements -- have the highest per capita new cases over the last seven days, followed by Alabama and Mississippi.

The virus's ongoing spread around the country has frustrated plans to safely reopen schools , forced college football conferences to postpone the lucrative fall season , and caused vast medical and economic pain.

""We have to figure out how to deal with this as a whole country because as long as there are cases happening in any part, we still have transit, especially now we have students going back to college,"" said Dr. Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""Any cases anywhere really keep risk pretty high all across the entirety of the United States.""

In Texas, state officials redoubled their efforts to get residents to wear masks and practice social distancing, and suggested people have let their guard down.

""The most important thing I could convey today that is even though the numbers of Covid-19 have improved, it has not left Jefferson County, it has not left Orange County, it has not left the state of Texas,"" Gov. Greg Abbott said in a news conference Tuesday.

Texas's case spike in July came after people let their guards down as the state reopened, Beaumont Mayor Becky Ames said in the news conference with Abbott. And rising positivity rates now could be the result of the same thing, Abbott said.

""There's a reason why this is happening, I believe, and that is some people feel if they're just with family members -- even if it's 50 family members -- they can let their guard down,"" Abbott said. ""And that turns out not to be the case.""

School buildings have been reopening across the country, even as new coronavirus cases among students and staff have been reported in places where in-person learning has resumed.

In Ohio, more than a third of students, totaling about 590,000 children, will return to full-time in-person learning, Gov. Mike DeWine said Tuesday.

But of the 101 largest school districts in the country, 63 will start the new academic year remotely.

Public schools in Elizabeth, New Jersey, had to scrap plans to return to classrooms and switch to virtual learning after more than 400 teachers notified the district that they could not return to campus due to ""special considering for health-related risks.""

Students have not yet returned to school in the Broken Arrow Public School District in Oklahoma, but 33 district employees tested positive last week, Superintendent Janet Vinson said Monday, according to Tulsa World.

Meanwhile, North Paulding High School in Georgia will announce plans to reopen Wednesday after reporting several virus cases and receiving criticism over a viral photo that showed students -- few wearing masks -- walking in a packed school hallway.

Rely on the science and avoid the politics, Fauci says

Although practices like wearing face coverings have been politicized, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday he has learned that in order to be a good public health leader in a crisis, you have to divorce yourself from politics, rely on science and be as transparent as possible.

""Completely divorce yourself from the kind of political undertones that sometimes go into an important outbreak like this,"" Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said as he was honored with a 2020 Citizen Leadership Award on Tuesday night by the Aspen Institute.

""You've got to stay away from that, lead by example, be perfectly honest and don't be afraid to say you don't know something when you don't know it. I find that to be a very good formula when you're dealing in a crisis.""

Even with the polarization, every state in the US passed at least one physical distancing measure in March to slow the spread, researchers from Harvard University and University College London said. Those measures worked, a new study found.

Physical distancing resulted in a reduction of more than 600,000 cases within just three weeks, according to the study, published Tuesday in the journal PLOS. Had there not been preventative interventions, the models suggest up to 80% of Americans would have been infected with Covid-19.

""In short, these measures work, and policy makers should use them as an arrow in their quivers to get on top of local epidemics where they are not responding to containment measures,"" said the study's co-author Dr. Mark J. Siedner in a news release

Rushing, but not racing, toward a vaccine

A vaccine against the virus is anxiously anticipated, but health experts said that the US will not rush its development -- even as Russia announces its own.

""We will require any vaccine in the United States be safe and effective and meet the FDA's gold standard,"" US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said during a news conference from Taipei, Taiwan, adding that ""this is not a race to be first.""

Russia claims to have approved a ""world first"" coronavirus vaccine, but is only in the first step of clinical trials, Azar said. And data from those trials have not been made public.

Fauci has serious doubts that Russia's approved vaccine is safe and effective, he told Deborah Roberts of ABC News.

""We have half a dozen or more vaccines,"" Fauci said. ""So if we wanted to take the chance of hurting a lot of people or giving them something that doesn't work, we could start doing this, you know, next week if we wanted to. But that's not the way it works."""|0
2020-08-12|"""We all want it to be normal, we all want our regular lives back and I have nothing but sympathy and empathy for people who do, but we're not living in normal times,"" he told CNN. ""And that's the thing, people are just choosing to live as if it is, until it's impossible to ignore.""

The number of quarantines since schools in Woodstock and the rest of Cherokee County opened last week is just that -- impossible to ignore. At least 478 students and teachers were asked to quarantine after possible exposure to Covid-19 in the first five days of classes. By early Tuesday, that number had swelled to 925 students and staff. Nearly one-third of the district's schools -- which teach 30,000 students from elementary to high -- have been impacted.

Chambers, who fears the coronavirus will spread throughout the area, which is about 30 minutes north of Atlanta, says he saw this coming. He, along with other district parents, received a letter from Cherokee County School Superintendent Brian Hightower in mid-July announcing a 77-page reopening plan.

""One day later it was voted on, with limited opportunity for the public to participate,"" Chambers said of the vote, which was limited to those who were able to show up last-minute. ""When the committee that created the reopening plan was created there were no teachers on it and teachers were not given a chance to review it before it was published for the public.""

Chambers became a well-known local activist after he wrote an open letter to the superintendent blasting the reopening plan. ""I see little evidence that guidelines from (the US Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Health) were a guiding factor in creating these policies. In fact, your plan seems to repeatedly soften or ignore their recommendations altogether while seeming to envision a 'best case scenario' when it comes to young people complying with these changing rules and the teachers' ability to monitor and enforce them,"" wrote Chambers, a game designer. The plan now in place in schools means students do not social distance and adults do not wear facial coverings. Chambers believes students going in-person are at risk and is keeping his 10-year-old and 4-year-old at home. CNN reached out to Superintendent Hightower, who declined an interview. The school district's chief communications officer, Barbara P. Jacoby, said: ""(O)ur communications efforts are focused on directly communicating with parents."" On Tuesday, Hightower told parents Etowah High School in Woodstock would have close to in-person learning from the end of the day until at least August 31. There have been 14 positive coronavirus cases at the school, he said, with tests pending for another 15 students. Some 294 students and staff have been asked to quarantine. Hightower urged people to social distance and wear masks. ""As your Superintendent, I wear a mask whenever I cannot social distance. We know all parents do not believe the scientific research that indicates masks are beneficial, but I believe it and see masks as an important measure to help us keep schools open,"" he wrote to parents. Brandy Heath, here with her family, says she expected the school district to take more precautions to keep everyone safe. Requiring masks is a decision that is being left up to individual schools in Cherokee County. Across Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp has encouraged mask-wearing but ruled out any mandates and says he supports local decision-making. A little north of Woodstock, Brandy Heath thought that sending her fourth and sixth graders back into classrooms at Freedom Middle and Liberty Elementary in Canton was definitely the better option for their learning. ""I sent my son to face-to-face learning because, as any parent knows, school is the best place for our children. Their teachers are educated, and they can teach things to our kids that we can't,"" she told CNN. More on kids, schools and coronavirus

As soon as she heard that, Heath, who says she is immuno-compromised, pulled her kids back home for distance learning. ""We expected the Cherokee County School District to keep our kids safe. To take precautions that ensure their safety. And it's not being done,"" she said. Back on the playground in Woodstock, Jamie Chambers said he feels sometimes like he's fighting a losing battle. In this deeply conservative part of Georgia, he says politics continue to be put before science, with even some school officials telling staff that they believe the coronavirus is a hoax, he said. Some of the parents at the park appeared less concerned about the virus. ""I don't regret sending my kids to school,"" the mother of a fourth and fifth grader, who declined to give her name, told CNN. ""They're either going to get the virus in school or outside of school, might as well send them back."""|1
2020-08-12|"In a series of essays called The Distance, Thomas Lake is telling the stories of Americans living through the pandemic. Email thomas.lake@cnn.com if you have a story idea.

Canton, Georgia (CNN) After 28 years as a schoolteacher, Tracy Strange knew how the first week should go. The school would smell fresh and clean. The floors would be polished. The children would be hopeful, their enthusiasm not yet diminished by the fatigue of the year. She would learn their names, teach them the basics of human anatomy, and introduce them to a model skeleton named Fred.

Tracy woke up early on Monday, August 3, the first day of school at Sequoyah High in Cherokee County. But she never left the house. Instead she drank her coffee alone and worried about the other teachers. And she cried.

""We all just want to do our jobs,"" she told me on the phone later that week. ""We want to be alive to do them.""

Tracy is 53, with a minor heart ailment and a more serious lung condition. Her father smoked in the home when she was a child, leaving her vulnerable to respiratory viruses. In 2014, a bad case of the flu became pneumonia and put her in the hospital. Now her in-laws live with her. Both are in their 70s. Her mother-in-law has diabetes and high blood pressure; her father-in-law has Parkinson's Disease and takes immunosuppressive drugs for his rheumatoid arthritis. All that to say why Tracy could not afford to bring home the coronavirus.

As Georgia's infection rate soared in July, many districts chose not to physically re-open schools in August. But in Cherokee County, an upscale area of about 250,000 in the green hills between Atlanta and the Appalachian Mountains, parents wanted a choice. According to district spokeswoman Barbara Jacoby, the county gave it to them. Students could learn digitally from home or in person at school. But teachers would have no such choice. Even if they were teaching virtual classes, they would have to do so from a school building. And students would not be required to wear masks.

For Tracy, the risk was too great. She resigned and applied for early retirement. On the Friday before school started, she went to her empty classroom and prepared it for the teacher who would take her place. She hooked up the printer, arranged the tables and chairs, and said good-bye to Fred the skeleton.

Then she went home to worry and wait. She considered herself lucky. Although she would take a financial penalty for early retirement, she could stay home. Other teachers decided they could not. Some were single mothers. She couldn't stop thinking about them.

The district's first letter came home last Tuesday, the second day of school. At Sixes Elementary School in Canton, a second-grader tested positive for Covid-19. The classroom would be temporarily closed. The teacher and 20 students would be quarantined for two weeks. On Wednesday two more positive tests were reported at two other schools. On Thursday, two more. By Friday, with a dozen positive tests across the district, more than 250 people were under quarantine. It was all happening even faster than Tracy expected.

Viral loads, lines of defense, molecular warfare. Her work felt more relevant than ever, and she was not there to do it. She imagined the children in what used to be her classroom. About 30 of them, two at each table, pressed in close for 55 minutes. Young hearts and lungs. The air circulating.

I drove up to Sequoyah High School that afternoon and watched from the parking lot as the school day ended. A breath of wind, a touch of rain. Ford and Chevrolet in the traffic circle. Three students walked to the flagpole and lowered the flags. By Tuesday night, with nearly 60 positive tests in the Cherokee County system, more than 900 people would be under quarantine. Etowah High School would be forced to close.

Other schools would remain open. People would do what they wanted. These choices would have consequences, for themselves and for others, and some of those consequences would be shattering and irreversible. At Sequoyah, the children dispersed. It was just another afternoon outside another high school in a nation grappling with the meaning of freedom. A girl drove off in a Jeep Liberty. The players got ready for football practice."|1
2020-08-12|"At least 800 people died around the world because of coronavirus-related misinformation in the first three months of this year, researchers say.

A study published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene says about 5,800 people were admitted to hospital as a result of false information on social media.

Many died from drinking methanol or alcohol-based cleaning products.

They wrongly believed the products to be a cure for the virus.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously said that the ""infodemic"" surrounding Covid-19 spread just as quickly as the virus itself, with conspiracy theories, rumours and cultural stigma all contributing to deaths and injuries.
• Coronavirus vaccine: When will we have one?

Many of the victims had followed advice resembling credible medical information - such as eating large amounts of garlic or ingesting large quantities of vitamins - as a way of preventing infection, the study's authors say. Others drank substances such as cow urine.

These actions all had ""potentially serious implications"" on their health, the researchers say.

The paper concludes that it is the responsibility of international agencies, governments and social media platforms to fight back against this ""infodemic"", but tech companies have been criticised for their slow and patchy response. In the UK, laws to regulate online harm might be several years away.

The BBC's own investigations found links to assaults, arson and deaths as a result of misinformation about the virus, and spoke to doctors, experts and victims about their experiences.

Online rumours led to mob attacks in India and mass poisonings in Iran. Telecommunications engineers have been threatened and attacked and phone masts have been set alight in the UK and other countries because of conspiracy theories that have been incubated and amplified online.

Social media also helps scammers to take advantage of the pandemic, selling ineffective badges that claim to ward off the virus, and urging followers to part with money in exchange for a ""mineral miracle supplement"", which is - in reality - diluted bleach.

As vaccines emerge, there is the further threat that anti-vaccine campaigners will use the platform provided by social media to persuade people not to protect themselves.

Despite social media companies removing or labelling misleading information about vaccines, recent polling in the United States showed that 28% of Americans believe that Bill Gates wants to use vaccines to implant microchips in people.

The achievement of an effective coronavirus vaccine could be completely undermined by misinformation, doctors told the BBC's anti-disinformation team.

2020-08-12|"The damage caused by last week's deadly explosion in Beirut continues to hamper healthcare in the Lebanese capital.

The World Health Organization (WHO) assessed 55 healthcare facilities in the city and found that half of them were ""non-functional"".

Three major hospitals had to close and three more had to reduce their capacity following the blast.

The WHO also warned that in some facilities Covid-19 prevention measures were not being adhered to.

More than 200 people died and more than 6,000 were injured in the blast, according to the city's governor Marwan Abboud. The explosion was caused by more than 2,700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely at the city's port.

On Tuesday, people in Beirut marked the moment the blast hit exactly a week earlier.

There has been outrage that so much explosive material was allowed to be stored in the port. The government resigned on Monday following angry street protests.

What's the state of the hospitals?

Dr Richard Brennan, the WHO's regional emergency director in the Eastern Mediterranean, said that they had assessed 55 primary healthcare clinics in Beirut.

Of those, just over half were found to be ""non functional"", leaving Beirut short of 500 hospital beds as it continues to deal with thousands of injured residents.

• What we know about the blast

The WHO said its priority was to get those hospitals and clinics that had closed, up and running as fast as possible. Dr Brennan said that to ensure supplies got to those who needed them, the WHO was distributing them directly to health facilities it had identified in its own assessments.

He stressed the importance of restoring health facilities to their full capacity both to treat those injured and to deal with a recent surge in daily coronavirus cases.

Lebanon has had 7,121 confirmed cases of coronavirus, according to health ministry figures released on Tuesday. There have been 87 Covid-related deaths.

Dr Brennan praised Lebanon's response to the pandemic, saying it had done an ""impressive job"" tackling it.

But he warned that there had been ""an uptick in the number of cases prior to the blast"". He added that the country had registered its highest number of daily cases on Tuesday.

""While we have to still continue to respond to the consequences of the blast, we also need to stay vigilant with respect to Covid,"" he urged.

He said he thought it was possible to ""get on top"" of the recent acceleration in cases if the response was stepped up.

What's the damage in the city?

Hundreds of buildings were destroyed by the blast, leaving parts of the city looking like a war zone. Many historical buildings are among those damaged.

On Wednesday, the authorities announced a ban on the sale of these old buildings to prevent several historical districts from being gutted by developers seeking profits.

The fear is that these traditional homes could be torn down and replaced by high-rise apartment blocks as has happened in other parts of Beirut in the past.

There have also been concerns that Lebanon could soon run low on bread as the silos in the port storing its grain supplies took the brunt of the blast.

But the Lebanese economy minister, Raoul Nehme, tweeted that the country had enough supplies of flour for the next four months."|1

2020-08-12|"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway said it would reimpose quarantine measures on travellers from more foreign countries and reiterated its advice that Norwegians should avoid going abroad amid a jump in the number of new coronavirus cases.

Norway diagnosed 357 people with COVID-19 last week, the highest since April, but still well below the record 1,733 cases found in a single week in late March, data from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) showed.

“We’re doing this now so that everyone as soon as possible will be able to live their lives as freely as possible,” Prime Minister Erna Solberg told a news conference.

“All foreign travel is associated with a risk of infection,” Solberg said.

Norway last week put on hold a plan to further reopen society and urged its citizens to refrain from foreign travel.

While not a member of the European Union, Norway belongs to the passport-free Schengen travel zone. It had some of the strictest travel restrictions in Europe in the early phase of the pandemic before gradually lifting them from June.

It will now reimpose 10-day quarantines from Saturday for all travellers from Poland, Malta, Iceland, Cyprus and the Netherlands, as well as the Faroe Islands and some Danish and Swedish regions.

Norway has already reintroduced similar constraints for Spain, France, Switzerland and several others, and has put on hold a plan to permit leisure travel from some non-European countries, which has been banned since March.

The recommendation not to go abroad will remain in place until Oct. 1.

With a population of 5.4 million, Norway had reported a total of 9,750 cases as of Wednesday, with 256 deaths.

Still, hospitalisations have barely risen in recent weeks, FHI director Line Vold said.

“This may be because hospitalisations typically come at a later stage of the illness, and also because there are more young people being infected,” Vold said.

Authorities are also discussing whether to update guidelines on the wearing of face masks in crowded spaces which, for now, is not recommended."|0

Of the new cases, 85 were registered in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki and 66 in the capital Athens.

The increase in infections in recent weeks has prompted authorities to gradually introduce more restrictions during the peak of the tourism season.

From Aug. 17, visitors arriving from Sweden, Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic will need proof they have tested negative for the novel coronavirus to gain entry. The test cannot be older than 72 hours prior to arrival.

The same requirement will apply to all visitors entering Greece via land borders. A negative test is already required for passengers arriving with a flight connection from Bulgaria, Romania, the United Arab Emirates and Malta.

Last week, it said it had cleared infections from all of the dormitories - housing around 300,000 workers - barring some blocks which continue to serve as isolation zones.

2020-08-12|"(Reuters) - Venezuelan oil minister Tareck El Aissami said on Wednesday he had recovered from the novel coronavirus, a month after he tested positive for COVID-19.

El Aissami, who is also the OPEC nation’s economic vice president and was named to the position of oil minister earlier this year, said on Twitter he had received a negative result on a rapid test for the virus.

“Thanks to President Nicolas Maduro and [first lady] Cilia Flores for all their support and strong prayers,” El Aissami wrote. “We have overcome.”

Venezuela, whose oil industry and economy have unraveled during Maduro’s six-year tenure, has reported 27,938 cases of the coronavirus and 238 deaths.

Besides El Aissami, the most prominent member of the ruling socialist party who has tested positive is Diosdado Cabello, who presides over the government-friendly National Constituent Assembly and is widely recognized as Maduro’s second-in-command.

Cabello has rarely been seen in public since testing positive in early July, though last week state-funded media outlets published images of him standing and waving outside a health clinic."|0

Parana state had said on Tuesday it was in talks to produce the vaccine, although it was unclear if the state’s research institute would get the necessary regulatory approvals from Brazil’s federal government.

The state press office said the head of the Parana Technology Institute (Tecpar) would host a news conference to discuss the memorandum of understanding at 4:30 p.m. local time (1930 GMT).

2020-08-12|"(Reuters) - British infrastructure contractor Balfour Beatty (BALF.L) sank to a 26 million pound pretax loss in the first half of 2020 as the COVID-19 crisis hampered construction work at several sites across its business.

But the company said it expects its earnings-based businesses, which include UK construction, U.S. construction and support services, to recover steadily through second half of the year, with overall operating profit returning to levels roughly equivalent to that for 2019 next year.

Although Britain’s construction industry expanded at the fastest rate in almost five years in July, according to a survey released last week, the sector has a long way to go before output returns to pre-COVID levels.

Balfour Beatty said its order book rose 20% to 17.5 billion pounds ($22.84 billion), helped by contracts for High Speed 2 - a rail line connecting London to northern England.

The London-headquartered company said it would look to re-instate dividend payments as soon as appropriate.

2020-08-12|"Aug 12 (Reuters) - Shares of Moderna Inc rose 11% on Wednesday after the company signed a $1.5 billion deal with the U.S. government for the supply of its experimental coronavirus vaccine.

Moderna will provide about 100 million doses, with the price coming to around $30.50 per person for a two dose regimen.

The company’s vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273, is one of the few that have already advanced to the final stage of testing and is on track to be completed in September, the company said this month.

The deal confirms that Moderna’s experimental vaccine is one of the leading contenders, said BMO analyst George Farmer, who has an “outperform” rating on the stock.

Effective vaccines and treatments are seen as essential in halting the COVID-19 pandemic, with the United States and the UK spending billions to reserve supplies of experimental vaccines.

Other countries, including Japan and EU members, have also signed deals for potential vaccines from AstraZeneca Plc and Pfizer Inc.

With the U.S. contract now signed, other deals could follow, said Jefferies analyst Michael Yee, who has a “buy” rating.

“We assume other countries ... will want to secure deals out of sheer responsibility before the capacity of the major 3-4 players is locked up.”

The U.S. deal would pay out in full if the vaccine achieves certain regulatory milestones before Jan. 31, 2021. (bit.ly/2CjrpKr)

Moderna shares, which have more than tripled and are among the top percentage gainers on the Nasdaq biotech index this year, were trading at $76.75 before the opening bell."|2

2020-05-27|"Before the hWJC transplantation, the patients had symptoms of high fever (38.5 °C ± 0.5 °C), weakness, shortness of breath, and low oxygen saturation. However, 2~7 days after transplantation, all the symptoms disappeared, and the oxygen saturations rose to 98% at rest. In addition, no acute infusion-related or allergic reactions were observed within 2 h after transplantation. Similarly, no delayed hypersensitivity or secondary infections were detected after treatment.

Both fever and shortness of breath disappeared on the 2nd day after hWJC transplantation. Chest CT imaging showed that the ground-glass opacity and pneumonia infiltration had largely reduced on the 6th day after hWJC transplantation (Fig. 1C-1–C-4). The CT score of the pulmonary involvement [16] was represented in Table 1.

The immunoregulatory function of hWJCs contributed to the main efficacy outcome. As shown in Fig. 2, the percentage and counts of CD3+ T cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell were increased, which indicated that the immune function of patients was improved after the hWJC administration. Meanwhile, the levels of plasma CRP and inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-α) were all decreased after hWJC treatment (Fig. 3). All these results indicated that the inflammation status of the patient was alleviating quickly.

For the critically severe patient, before hWJC transplantation, COVID-19 nucleic acid was positive. Six days after transplantation (March 1), COVID-19 nucleic acid turned to be negative.

The cure of COVID-19 is essentially dependent on the patient’s own immune system. The virus infection caused a total function failure of the lymphocytes, even of the whole immune system [6, 17]. However, when the overactivated immune system kills the virus, it produces a large amount of inflammatory factors, leading to severe cytokine storms [6, 15]. The cytokine storms deteriorated the patient’s states which may cause the disabled function of endothelial cells and the capillary leakage and could lead to multiple organ failure [3, 6].

MSC therapy can inhibit the overactivation of the immune system and promote endogenous repair by improving the microenvironment [6]. After entering the human body through intravenous infusion, part of the MSCs accumulates in the lung, which could improve the pulmonary microenvironment, protect alveolar epithelial cells, prevent pulmonary fibrosis, and improve lung function [12, 13]. Meanwhile, recent studies suggest that MSCs played the vital immune modulation roles on lymphocyte subsets and can secrete anti-inflammatory factors to prevent the cytokine storm [6, 9, 11].

Our results showed that the administration of intravenous injection of hWJCs significantly improved the inflammation and immune situation in severe COVID-19 patients. After hWJC adoptive transfer, no obvious side effects were observed, indicating it was well tolerated. The serum CRP and inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-α) of the patient were gradually reduced, and some other vital signs were also improved. The trachea cannula was also pulled off, and the patient could ambulate on the ground from February 26 as well. Meanwhile, the counts of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell were remarkably increased after intravenous injection of hWJCs. All these results suggested that transplantation of hWJCs could improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients maybe through regulating inflammatory response and promoting the recovery of antiviral immune cells and organs.

In addition, emerging evidences indicate that the epithelial and endothelial regulated cell death (RCD) caused by inflammation is closely related to the pathogenesis of many pulmonary disorders [18]. MSCs are known to improve cell survival and prevent apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis occurring in various parenchymal or nonparenchymal cells and immune cells under unfavorable conditions [18, 19]. The assessment of the ability of hWJCs in modulating RCD would certainly benefit patients receiving hWJC therapy, particularly those with COVID-19. Therefore, how hWJCs can counteract cell death and promote cell regeneration should be discussed in the future."|0
2020-05-27|"South Korea’s highest-profile investment in basic research is in the Institute for Basic Science (IBS), a network of research centres that comprises the nation’s answer to Germany’s Max Planck Society and Japan’s RIKEN.

Founded in 2011 after a 2007 promise by conservative, Lee Myung-bak, during his successful campaign for the country’s presidency, the institute sought to attract elite researchers from at home and abroad by giving successful individual applicants, as centre directors, full autonomy over their centre’s research and a budget of 10 billion won (US$8.2 billion) per year for ten years.

The centres cover areas including dark matter, nanomaterials, genome engineering and climate change. But, after criticism that they were taking money away from the greater scientific community, the goal of 50 centres has been reduced to 30 for now, with average budgets trimmed to about 6 billion won.

IBS president, Noh Do Young, warns that the cuts are “likely to inhibit IBS’s efforts to fulfil its missions and visions”, arguing that the budgets are not large, considering centres can employ dozens of researchers each.

Many IBS researchers say the level of funding has helped their research reach new heights. For instance, in March 2020, the Center for RNA Research at Seoul National University used cutting-edge sequencers purchased with IBS funds to become one of the first research groups in the world to sequence the transcriptome — the total product of all expressed genes — of the coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic1. The sequencers can directly identify the molecules in RNA sequences, as well as where they are modified by other molecules. Narry Kim, a biochemist and the centre’s director, says the work required an interdisciplinary team of virologists, microbiologists and computational scientists, which was enabled by IBS’s steady support. “Without IBS funding, I don’t think it would have been possible,” she says.

Among other prominent IBS results, the Center for Genome Engineering supplied the gene-editing tools in a blockbuster 2017 study2 in Nature that claimed the CRISPR–Cas9 gene-editing system was used to correct a mutation that causes heart disease in viable human embryos by replacing the mutated copy from the sperm with the correct gene from the egg. The results have been hotly debated, as some scientists argue there could be alternative explanations.

In 2018, results reported in Nature3 by the Center for Underground Physics, from its laboratory in a subterranean power plant in Yangyang County near the country’s east coast, ascribed constraints to the theorized particles that could make up dark matter. And in 2019, a collaboration including the Center for Climate Physics in Busan proposed in Nature4 that the first ancestors of modern humans came from a prehistoric wetland in modern-day Botswana, roughly 200,000 years ago. The work combined the centre’s supercomputer climate models with a genetic analysis of populations in Namibia and South Africa.

IBS came under heavy scrutiny in 2019, when reports surfaced in South Korean media of misappropriated funds and nepotism in hiring, which had allegedly been uncovered by government audits, at several centres. Doochul Kim, a physicist who was president of IBS at the time, said these were mostly the result of administrative errors and that the audits were politically motivated by liberal lawmakers. In late 2019, Kim announced reforms to IBS’s administrative structure, to be carried out under his successor, Noh, who started in November 2019.

The year 2020 marks another significant milestone for IBS: the first group of centres are coming up for review. Unlike at the Max Planck Society, centre directors at IBS are not awarded a lifetime appointment, and centres are subject to a make-or-break review after eight years to determine if they will be extended beyond their original ten-year remit. “This review session will shape the future of IBS,” says Noh. He says centres may close as a result, although new centres may take their place. (Noh adds that the process may be delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, if crucial on-site visits by international reviewers, scheduled for July, cannot go ahead.)

The model has its advocates. “I like that pressure,” says Andreas Heinrich, who left IBM Almaden in San Jose, California, to lead the IBS Center for Quantum Nanoscience in Seoul. “If I cannot build a top-class research centre in eight years, either I’m not the right person for the job, or it’s not possible in that environment.”"|0
2020-05-27|"When it comes to funding research, South Korea is in rarefied air. As a percentage of its gross domestic product, its spending on research and development is second only to Israel’s.

The speed of this ascent has been dizzying, up from 2.1% of its gross domestic product in 2000, when it was equal to the average of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member nations, to more than 4.5% in 2018, with Israel alone surpassing it at 4.9%, according to the latest available figures.

But this surge has not been even. Rather, it has favoured top-down, government-directed projects intended to boost competitiveness in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics and materials, often in partnership with the private sector, consistent with the post-war focus on applied research that turned South Korea into a leader in semiconductor manufacturing and wireless communication networks.

New priorities, however, have taken root. For the past decade, the necessity to invest in basic research has been a common refrain from South Korean researchers and politicians alike. To maintain economic growth, the nation has sought to become a ‘first mover’, instead of simply a ‘fast follower’ — rhetoric embraced by the current liberal president, Moon Jae-in, and his predecessor, the conservative Park Geun-hye. The drive to compete more effectively in strategic fields continues, but South Korea has begun emphasizing bottom-up funding for small teams of researchers, betting that strength will flow from the creativity of its scientists.

On paper, the rhetoric is backed by funding. Under President Moon, who was first elected in 2017, the basic-research budget for South Korea’s main funding agency, the National Research Foundation (NRF), has skyrocketed under a five-year plan to double it by 2022 to 2.5 trillion won (US$2 billion). The nation’s budget for 2020 allows for a remarkable 18% increase from the previous year in government spending on research and development (R&D), to 24.2 trillion won.

In the private sector, which makes up roughly three-quarters of R&D spending, basic-research spending is also surging, including outlays by major conglomerates such as Samsung and LG Electronics. “Industry is asking universities to produce more and more PhDs,” says Han Woong Yeom, a physicist at Pohang University of Science and Technology and vice-chair of Moon’s presidential advisory council on science and technology. “The situation cannot be better than this, in terms of investment.”

Spending surged over the past two decades on large national projects, such as a lunar orbiter scheduled for launch in 2022, a nanomaterials research effort dubbed the ‘Creative Materials Discovery Program’, and Korea’s branch of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, the main experiment of which is under construction in southern France. “Previously, more emphasis was on the mission-oriented research towards immediate economic output,” says microbiologist, Jung-Hye Roe, whom Moon tapped to lead the NRF in 2018.

There is a new emphasis on bottom-up funding through NRF grants. Currently, the NRF accounts for slightly more than one-quarter of total government-funded research, with a budget of close to 7 trillion won in 2020. The amount spent on basic-research grants to principal investigators is now roughly equal to that spent on top-down, mission-oriented projects, and Roe hopes to boost the basic-research grants still further.

Recent highlights from these grants include: a gallium arsenide nanoresonator that can trap light and change its colour, work published in Science1 in January and co-led by Hong-Gyu Park of Korea University in Seoul; atmospheric observations from Gosan-ri on Jeju Island as part of an international study2, co-led by Sunyoung Park of Kyungpook National University in Daegu and published in Nature in 2019, that identified eastern China as a major source of the emission of chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals that destroy the ozone layer that are banned under the Montreal Protocol; and the finding that the development of osteoarthritis is related to how the body processes cholesterol, in a 2019 Nature study3, led by Je-Hwang Ryu of Chonnam National University in Gwangju and Jang-Soo Chun of the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology.

The top-down division can claim successes too, including playing a key role in the nation’s ability to quickly develop and produce diagnostic kits for COVID-19, says Roe. The first four companies to win urgent-use approval for their tests had all received NRF funding to research the production of such kits after the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea infected 186 people and killed 36. And in February, the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, responsible for the nation’s space programme, launched the Cheollian 2B satellite; its main instrument, the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) is designed to monitor air pollution in the Asia-Pacific region, making it the first of a new generation of satellites intended to study global air quality.

An emphasis on government-mandated metrics in hiring and promotion, which critics say incentivizes researchers to present work of little value in low-quality journals or conferences, remains to be addressed. Last May, the nation’s education ministry reported that 574 researchers had participated in international conferences organized by ‘predatory publishers’. “That happens because, so far, we have emphasized getting large numbers of quantitative, shallow publications,” says Roe.

“I think this old-style culture is prohibiting the booming of our creativity,” says Yeom. “This may still be good enough to produce many papers, but not original ideas.”

The outlook is uncertain. Not only does the expected heavy economic burden of recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic threaten to curb the growth in R&D budgets, but South Korea’s traditional industries — including chip-making, ship-making and nuclear power — face increased competition from China. Political tensions with Japan that flared in July 2019, fuelled by that nation’s legacy of colonial rule, threatened to cut off supplies of key materials for semiconductor production, exposing how heavily the nation’s technology industry relies on Japanese manufacturers.

There is talk in policy circles of a science and technology new deal — a boost in funding and programmes to combat the effects of a less globalized world in which South Korea’s access to scientific supplies and talent is reduced, says So Young Kim, director of the Korea Policy Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, a think tank affiliated with KAIST in Daejeon. Yeom says researchers stand to benefit from a public appetite for societal change, which also translates into support for increased science funding. Yeom and other policymakers are pushing for greater investment in research topics that meet the practical needs of South Korean society, such as air pollution, and an ageing population. In response, the Moon administration has begun an initiative to trace and reduce fine particulate matter across northeast Asia, and another to fight dementia.

Some suspect it will be initiatives such as these that do most to move South Korea away from the label ‘fast follower’. “The definition of top-level research doesn’t need to be the highest impact factor or highest citation count,” says Roe. Pursuing research directions that benefit South Korean society is “making our own path, a new path, rather than following others”."|2

2020-06-25|"“Let's try to make something good out of something really bad,” says “Survivor: Africa” winner, and lymphoma survivor, Ethan Zohn.



Living with cancer can be an isolating experience. The key to getting through it, says “Survivor: Africa” winner and lymphoma survivor Ethan Zohn, is to push through the uncertainty and reach out for help, whether from friends, family, or fellow patients who understand the struggle.In a recent interview with CURE® , Zohn opened up about what helped him through his own diagnosis of a rare form of Hodgkin’s lymphoma at age 35, after appearing on the hit reality show “Survivor” and playing professional soccer earlier in his life.“My advice for someone who's facing a recent diagnosis is to surround yourself with the family and friends that care for you the most,” said Zohn. “Be vulnerable and open enough to ask for and receive help, as well. I think that's important.”While Zohn noted that it can be difficult to find and make connections with others, some organizations exist solely to help patients with cancer bridge that gap. Zohn credits groups like Stupid Cancer and Imerman Angels with helping him through his own cancer treatment and recovery. “If you're not the type of person who's going to want to call up or talk to a shrink, there are incredible programs (out there),” said Zohn.Creativity and mindfulness are other important factors that Zohn says helped him get through his own diagnosis, particularly during the long stretches in isolation while recovering from two stem cell transplants. “Everyone talks about being creative in isolation,” Zohn said. “I agree, it's good, being creative sparks your mind in a different way and helps pass the time in isolation. But in addition to that, it's a way to connect with other people.”Focusing on non-cancer related things like art classes, yoga or meditation classes that may be more readily available online now due to the COVID-19 pandemic could be helpful for patients or survivors to branch out of their comfort zone and connect with others. “This is a good way to break down barriers, distract yourself from the reality of what's going on in your life right now, and connect with others in a way that might not be around cancer that might make you feel a little bit comfortable.”Finally, finding a purpose is one of the best ways to cope with cancer. “I live by the saying to ‘never let a crisis go to waste’, because it's an opportunity to do some really important things,” said Zohn.After he received his diagnosis and took some time to determine his treatment plans and contemplate his future, Zohn then turned his focus to helping others by sharing his story. “Here I was using my cancer nightmare, the worst thing that could possibly happen to me, to help others in the world, said Zohn. “Helping others get diagnosed earlier, helping them manage their cancer care has been made it worthwhile for me to talk about my journey.”“Let's try to make something good out of something really bad.”"|2
2020-06-25|"TORONTO, June 25, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- ACLU president Susan Herman today said a 2015 report on the Minneapolis police proved the department was ""highly racist"" – five years before one of its members killed George Floyd this May. Herman made the remarks at the 30,000-attendee online conference Collision from Home, produced by the team behind Web Summit – the world's largest tech conference.

""In 2015 the ACLU did a report on the Minneapolis police department, which showed clearly that the Minneapolis police department was highly racist – they were arresting people over eight times as often for minor offences. And so the police department did adopt some minor reforms. They were doing bias training – and, hey, it didn't work. It's not enough,"" said Herman.

Herman articulated her vision for defunding the police, something she said is ""misunderstood"" and that ""makes people nervous"", adding, ""The people who are afraid of defunding the police are the people who are fortunate enough to be in a position where the police make them feel safe. Not everyone feels safer when the police are around – some people feel more threatened.""

Herman said defunding the police means reconsidering when we want police-based response to societal issues or whether different responses would be both more appropriate and effective.

""A quarter of the people who police end up arresting are people who have mental health issues and people who are acting strangely. So if we had real mental health services to deal with these people, or if we dealt with homelessness or drug addiction, in ways other than having the police have a major footprint all over the place. Number one we would be reducing the opportunities for the police to be effecting what I think almost inevitably is arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.""

""And number two we could use the money in better ways. The city of Los Angeles spends almost a third of its city budget on policing. They just agreed to reduce that by some, but the idea of defunding is maybe we could use that money in better ways that would actually keep us safer,"" said Herman.

2020-06-25|"The Federal Reserve recently banned 34 largest banks from share buybacks in the third quarter (Q3). The Fed additionally, capped dividend payment to the second quarter (Q2) levels for these banks.

In addition to releasing the results of the 2020 bank stress test, the US central bank also released sensitivity analyses, due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) economic impact, on Thursday.

While providing a broad update of the stress test, Fed Vice Chair Randal K. Quarles said that the banking system has been a source of strength during this crisis and the results of our sensitivity analyses show that our banks can remain strong in the face of even the harshest shocks.

The Board took several actions following its stress tests to ensure large banks remain resilient despite the economic uncertainty from the coronavirus event. For the third quarter of this year, the Board is requiring large banks to preserve capital by suspending share repurchases, capping dividend payments, and allowing dividends according to a formula based on recent income. The Board is also requiring banks to re-evaluate their longer-term capital plans. All large banks will be required to resubmit and update their capital plans later this year to reflect current stresses, which will help firms re-assess their capital needs and maintain strong capital planning practices during this period of uncertainty. The Board will conduct additional analysis each quarter to determine if adjustments to this response are appropriate.

Although the announcement came after Wall Street’s close, the news might help equities to extend the recent consolidation and favor a bit to the risks. However, fears of the coronavirus (COVID-19) as harsh enough to restrict any major optimism."|0
2020-06-25|"From the left: The Looming China-America Split

For years, China and the United States were in “a period of unconscious economic coupling,” but no more, observes The New York Times’ Thomas Friedman. The two are now headed for “divorce” — and China’s “overreach” is largely to blame: Under President Xi Jinping, the country has persecuted Uighurs, “aggressively” projected its power in the South China Sea, limited journalists’ rights, curtailed freedoms in Hong Kong and “hammered countries” that seek an independent inquiry into the coronavirus’ origins. The United States, meanwhile, has “underperformed,” reducing investments in infrastructure, education and “government-funded scientific research,” among other things. America and its allies now have to force Beijing to “accept new rules” on trade, COVID-19 and other issues. Alas, Beijing “respects one thing only: leverage.” And “today, we have too little and China has too much.”

Many elite journalists now argue that journalism should aim for “moral clarity” instead of “neutral objectivity” — a swap, Reason’s Matt Welch contends, that means “consciously elevating narrative ‘truths’ over verified facts.” Pulitzer Prize-winner Wesley Lowery, for one, wants journalists to “positively identify individuals and organizations as ‘racist’ ” — but how could they know? “Do ‘civil rights’ include the individual right to keep and bear arms, or to grow your own medical marijuana for personal consumption?” The new standard will let left-wing media showcase their “ideological sympathy,” inevitably leading to “journalistic sloppiness” or even “actual malfeasance.” If the journalists take “refuge in subjectivity” instead of aiming for objectivity, as media historian Tom Rosenstiel warns, “journalism will be lost.”

From the right: Trump’s Good Immigration Move

The last thing America’s pandemic-wracked economy needs is more foreign workers, argue National Review’s editors, so President Trump was right to issue a “new proclamation restricting many types of immigration through the end of the year.” Trump plainly had the requisite ­authority, since “current law gives the president incredibly broad authority to restrict immigration he deems ‘detrimental to the interests of the United States.’ ” And policy-wise, “the pandemic has temporarily changed America’s immigration needs. Seeing the jobless rate elevated throughout the economy,” the president correctly concluded that we have need of far fewer foreign workers. “If Congress doesn’t like his decision, it is free to change the law at any time.”

Back in 2017, recalls The Washington Post’s Megan McArdle, President Trump “came in for much derision” for suggesting that efforts to get rid of Confederate statues would soon lead to targeting of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Three years later, “Trump looks prescient, and his critics perhaps a touch naïve”: “The iconoclasts, having largely defeated the rebel army, are turning on the Founding Fathers.” Trump understood that “you cannot credibly declare that some revolution in social affairs,” from gay marriage to toppling statues, “has a natural stopping point unless you personally commit to stopping it when it goes too far.” Otherwise, “you will cede issue after issue to the radicals” — and “end up with something very different” from your original “idealistic vision.”

Ignore the Voice of America’s “dysfunction and criminality,” snarks Curtis Ellis at American Greatness; “the usual suspects, The New York Times and The Washington Post among them, are sounding the alarm” over President Trump’s choice to head the agency, Michael Pack, because he “is — gasp! — a conservative” with ties to Stephen Bannon. The VOA, they claim, will ­become “an arm of the Trump re-election committee.” Most “amusing” is how these “corporate media overlords” see themselves “as exemplars” of “objective reporting”: They’re basically saying if the VOA doesn’t do what they do, it’s “prima facie evidence” of interference. The truth is, given their own failure to be “reliable and authoritative” and to present a “balanced” picture, we need — “now more than ever” — an independent Voice of America, “at home as well as abroad.”"|1

• Results show provided £4.4 billion in support for UK exports to 69 countries
• 77% of the companies directly supported were SMEs, 88% of which were based outside of London
• ’s new Business Plan sets out how it will increase its support to UK exporters and suppliers

UK Export Finance ( ) has today published its results for 2019 to 2020, revealing it provided £4.4 billion in support for UK exports, helping UK companies trade with 69 countries.

supported 339 companies in 2019-20, up 29% on the previous year, with a sharp increase in companies in supply chains indirectly benefiting from support. 77% of the companies supported were SMEs, and 88% of these were based outside London as the department works with companies across the UK.

Businesses that benefited from support include Environmental Street furniture, a Belfast firm selling street furniture to the Dubai Arena, Tall Group, a printing company in Runcorn selling secure high school certificates to the Kenyan National Examination Council and IQA group, a Glasgow-based utilities contractor helping Angola improve its national power supply.

In the year the UK hosted the UK-Africa Investment Summit to strengthen trade ties with the continent, has seen significant growth in its support for UK exports to Africa. provided £780 million of support to facilitate UK exports to the continent, up from £625 million last year and rising from just £85 million five years ago. This included £110 million in financing for a new maternity hospital in Ghana that will help reduce infant mortality rates in the south of the country.

Secretary of State for International Trade, Liz Truss, said:

This has been another outstanding year for UK Export Finance, helping businesses in every part of the UK win export contracts. Supporting international trade will be crucial as the UK looks to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. UK Export Finance is already playing a critical role at the centre of the government’s plan to power an export-led recovery and its offer is more important than ever for UK exporters.

has today also launched its 2020 to 2024 Business Plan which sets out how the department will meet the challenges in providing export credit and trade finance support over the next four years, particularly as the UK recovers from the impact of COVID-19.

The Business Plan outlined new objectives that will allow to adapt its support for SMEs, help businesses across all the regions of the UK access products, and focus its activity on sectors and countries where support will have the greatest economic benefit. This includes plans to further develop its support for clean growth and renewable energy business by building on the £2 billion recently allocated to ’s direct lending facility for clean growth projects.

Marcus Dolman, Co-Chairman of the British Exporters’ Association ( ) welcomed the results and said:

welcomes the positive figures announced by today, which show a marked increase in business volumes compared with previous years and we commend for their continued support of UK exporters. is a critical resource for UK exporters and their importance will be amplified this year in supporting businesses through the current crisis. We praise their enthusiasm and ingenuity in developing new products and services. We particularly look forward to the new schemes that are under development being made available to all exporters imminently and see this as a real game changer in the support of UK exports.
• ’s support is provided on a commercial basis in partnership with over 100 private sector providers and the department charges a premium to cover its costs and the risk it takes on. In 2019-20, generated more than £177 million in premium income for the Exchequer.
• This year supported its first ever offshore-wind projects in 2019-2020, enabling British companies to win contracts on the Formosa 2, Changfang and Xidao wind farms in the Taiwan Strait with more than £300 million of support.
• support in 2019-2020 extended to Jaguar Land Rover, one of the country’s major exporters. guaranteed a £500 million loan to support the company’s continued investment into research and development of its electric vehicles - the first deal for of this kind, with ’s support tied to Jaguar Land Rover’s overall working capital needs instead of a specific export contract.

2020-06-25|"BuzzFeed News has reporters around the world bringing you trustworthy stories about the impact of the coronavirus. To help keep this news free, become a member .

""Everybody says, 'Oh, it's my family. I'm going to go see my brother. I’m going to see my cousin,' and they think that’s a safe word,"" Barbosa told BuzzFeed News.

Three have become so ill that they have been hospitalized: Barbosa's 88-year-old dad, his 86-year-old mom, and his sister, who is going through chemotherapy for breast cancer.

But after more than a dozen family members threw a surprise birthday dinner party for one of Barbosa's nieces last month, at least 18 members of the extended family have become sick with COVID-19.

Ron Barbosa's family has always been close. Members of the Dallas-area family see each other practically every day, and when the coronavirus pandemic struck, many of them thought it would be OK to continue spending time together.

While they aren't certain if the virus started spreading among the family at the May 30 party, Barbosa, 53, who did not attend the gathering, said that based on the time they started to see symptoms, it seems like the initial transmission among family members happened that weekend.

He said he believes his nephew, who hosted the party for his wife, was first exposed to the disease at work and that he had a cough on the day of the gathering.

""Next thing you know, the two nephews that basically live next door to him, they get the same cough and diarrhea, body aches, and they start getting sick,"" Barbosa said. ""By the 6th [of June] there was a lot of symptoms. And by the 9th, people are getting really, really bad. And by the 13th, I had to take my sister and my mom to the hospital.""

The rapid spread of the coronavirus among the family comes as cases explode in Texas, prompting officials there to scramble to bring things under control. As of Thursday, the state has recorded nearly 73,000 cases of COVID-19 and more than 2,200 deaths.

Due to recent increases in case numbers and hospitalizations, Gov. Greg Abbott said on Thursday the state will pause any further reopening. ""The last thing we want to do as a state is go backwards and close down businesses,"" Abbott said in a statement. ""This temporary pause will help our state corral the spread until we can safely enter the next phase of opening our state for business.""

Public health experts have advised people to avoid any close contact with others outside of their immediate household, wear face coverings, and keep a safe distance from others when they leave home to protect those who are at higher risk of severe illness.

Barbosa, who is a volunteer EMT and photographer, said he and his wife, a doctor, have not been spending much time with family outside of their own household and that they wear masks and keep their distance when they do leave. But he knows not everyone in his family has been doing the same.

""The kids feel like they’re bulletproof,"" he said. ""[They say], 'We’re safe. We’re going to keep living. We’re going to take trips, even. The airfares are down. We're blasting off!' And I said, 'You know what? If you come back and kill one of us, you’re going to feel bad' — and then it almost happened."""|1
2020-06-25|"California is seeing rising hospitalizations and ICU admissions in a renewed coronavirus surge, Gov. Gavin Newsom said, as other states—mostly in the South and West—see similar increases.

California reported it’s highest single-day increase of 7,149 cases on Tuesday and 5,349 cases on Wednesday. Hospitalizations have now increased by 32% while ICUs have gone up 19% over the past 14 days, Newsom said. Los Angeles County now has more cases than any other county in the U.S., but Newsom said San Bernardino, Riverside and Kings counties as well as the Bay Area are particular areas of concern. Officials say the increase may be occurring because of county-level reopenings, large gatherings and people not adhering to mask-wearing rules. California’s approach has been to let individual counties go at their own pace in reopening if they meet certain benchmarks—but Newsom said he would consider ""toggling back"" to stricter guidelines overruling local governments if there’s concern about capacity in the healthcare system.

The surge in cases comes a week after Newsom enacted a statewide mask order to contain further spread, especially in areas where mask wearing has become a politically charged issue. In Orange County, for example, former chief health officer Nichole Quick resigned after she was threatened by residents and questioned by the board of supervisors for supporting mandatory mask usage.

Coronavirus cases are spiking in other states too, especially those that reopened more rapidly last month, such as Florida, Nevada, Texas, Arizona and Oklahoma. Most of the new cases also seem to be impacting younger and healthier people. The renewed surge caused Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to pause on any reopening efforts on Thursday and suspend elective surgeries in four Texas counties to ensure hospital bed availability for Covid-19 patients.

Imperial County, which sits on the California/Mexico border, has 10 times more cases per 100,000 residents than the state average, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, and officials attribute the uptick to its proximity to Mexicali, a city in Mexico with a large outbreak. Large family gatherings, preexisting conditions in the population and bad air pollution may also be factors, according to the Los Angeles Times."|0
2020-06-25|"There was a time in March when it felt like we were all united in attacking COVID-19, but that honeymoon was short lived. By the end of April, the virus had become partisan.

 

If you listen to some voices you would believe the coronavirus and its disastrous repercussions are the fault of one man: Roy Cooper. That’s the narrative increasingly coming from Republicans and those on the right. They ask, “Why does one man have so much power to make decisions that affect us all?” Or, “Why won’t he listen to the legislature when they dictate the opening of bars, gyms, bowling alleys and nightclubs?” They generally conclude with, “Doesn’t he know he has wrecked the economy of our state, that there are more than a million people out of work?” Those and other questions will only be intensified after the Governor’s announcement keeping Phase Two restrictions in force.

 

Democrats are equally emphatic things would not have gotten so bad had President Trump not initially refused to recognize the pandemic, been willing to develop a coherent and consistent national strategy and accepted any accountability.

 

Here’s my spin: The coronavirus doesn’t care to which political party you belong, where you live, or anything else. While it might be easy to place blame on a governor or even the president let’s put the blame where it belongs – on the virus.

 

The biggest criticism of Governor Cooper centers around his singular power in making decisions. People forget we elected him to be Governor, the chief executive officer of our state. Our Statutes grant the executive extraordinary powers during times of emergency. Governor Cooper could blunt some of the criticisms if he would tell us who he consults, give their names and say how often he does so. I could perhaps agree that the governor should consult with and seek consensus from the Council of State with two reservations. First, I have watched committees deliberate decisions and the process does not lend itself to timely and decisive action in times of crisis. At least now we have one person to hold accountable.

 

Further, I could be more supportive if there was some confidence those statewide elected officials would give nonpartisan advice. This Council of State already proved they wouldn’t do so when Republican members signed a petition attempting to force Cooper to consult with them. No Democrats signed that petition.

 

Yes, there is a statute which says the Governor should get concurrence from the Council of State in some instances, however it is so vague and poorly written that a former Supreme Court justice said a case could be made for requiring concurrence, but could just as equally support the position the governor didn’t have to do so. The legislature is attempting to change that statute but would do well to consider setting a precedent they may someday regret. One day there will be another Republican governor perhaps forced to face an unfriendly Democratic majority in the Council of State.

 

The virus doesn’t care about any of this, but we should. I hope you agree we are weary of the partisan bickering at a time when we should be uniting to fight this virus. The health of our people and our economy are more important that partisan infighting. We are better than this."|1
2020-05-28|"T of Hong Kong want two things: to choose how they are governed, and to be subject to the rule of law. The Chinese Communist Party finds both ideas so frightening that many expected it to send troops to crush last year’s vast protests in Hong Kong. Instead, it bided its time. Now, with the world distracted by covid-19 and mass protests difficult because of social distancing, it has chosen a quieter way to show who’s boss. That threatens a broader reckoning with the world—and not just over Hong Kong, but also over the South China Sea and Taiwan.

On May 21st China declared, in effect, that Hong Kongers deemed to pose a threat to the party will become subject to the party’s wrath. A new security law, written in Beijing, will create still-to-be defined crimes of subversion and secession, terms used elsewhere in China to lock up dissidents, including Uighurs and Tibetans. Hong Kong will have no say in drafting the law, which will let China station its secret police there. The message is clear. Rule by fear is about to begin.

This is the most flagrant violation yet of the principle of “one country, two systems”. When the British colony was handed back to China in 1997, China agreed that Hong Kong would enjoy a “high degree of autonomy”, including impartial courts and free speech. Many Hong Kongers are outraged (see article). Some investors are scared, too. The territory’s stockmarket fell by 5.6% on May 22nd, its biggest drop in five years. Hong Kong is a global commercial hub not only because it is situated next to the Chinese mainland, but also because it enjoys the rule of law. Business disputes are settled impartially, by rules that are known in advance. If China’s unaccountable enforcers are free to impose the party’s whims in Hong Kong, it will be a less attractive place for global firms to operate.

China’s move also has implications far beyond Hong Kong. “One country, two systems” was supposed to be a model for Taiwan, a democratic island of 24m that China also sees as its own. The aim was to show that reunification with the motherland need not mean losing one’s liberty. Under President Xi Jinping, China seems to have tired of this charade. Increasingly, it is making bare-knuckle threats instead. The re-election in January of a China-sceptic Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, will have convinced China’s rulers that the chances of a peaceful reunification are vanishingly small. On May 22nd, at the opening of China’s rubber-stamp parliament, the prime minister, Li Keqiang, ominously cut the word “peaceful” from his ritual reference to reunification. China has stepped up war games around Taiwan and its nationalists have been braying online for an invasion.

China is at odds with other countries, too. In its building of island fortresses in the South China Sea, it ignores both international law and the claims of smaller neighbours. This week hundreds, perhaps thousands of Chinese troops crossed China’s disputed border with India in the Himalayas. Minor scuffles along this frontier are common, but the latest incursion came as a state-owned Chinese paper asserted new claims to land that its nuclear-armed neighbour deems Indian (see article). And, as a sombre backdrop to all this, relations with the United States are worse than they have been in decades, poisoning everything from trade and investment to scientific collaboration.

However much all the regional muscle-flexing appals the world, it makes sense to the Chinese Communist Party. In Hong Kong the party wants to stop a “colour revolution”, which it thinks could bring democrats to power there despite China’s best efforts to rig the system. If eroding Hong Kong’s freedoms causes economic damage, so be it, party bigwigs reason. The territory is still an important place for Chinese firms to raise international capital, especially since the Sino-American feud makes it harder and riskier for them to do so in New York. But Hong Kong’s is equivalent to only 3% of mainland China’s now, down from more than 18% in 1997, because the mainland’s economy has grown 15-fold since then. China’s rulers assume that multinational firms and banks will keep a base in Hong Kong, simply to be near the vast Chinese market. They are probably right.

The simple picture that President Donald Trump paints of America and China locked in confrontation suits China’s rulers well. The party thinks that the balance of power is shifting in China’s favour. Mr Trump’s insults feed Chinese nationalist anger, which the party is delighted to exploit—just as it does any tensions between America and its allies. It portrays the democracy movement in Hong Kong as an American plot. That is absurd, but it helps explain many mainlanders’ scorn for Hong Kong’s protesters.

The rest of the world should stand up to China’s bullying. On the Sino-Indian border, the two sides should talk more to avoid miscalculations, as their leaders promised to in 2018. China should realise that, if it tries the tactics it has used in the South China Sea, building structures on disputed ground and daring others to push back, it will be viewed with greater distrust by all its neighbours.

In the case of Taiwan China faces a powerful deterrent: a suggestion in American law that America might come to Taiwan’s aid were the island to be attacked. There is a growing risk that a cocksure China may decide to put that to the test. America should make clear that doing so would be extremely dangerous. America’s allies should echo that, loudly.

Hong Kong’s options are bleaker. The Hong Kong Policy Act requires America to certify annually that the territory should in trade and other matters be treated as separate from China. This week the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, declared that “facts on the ground” show Hong Kong is no longer autonomous. This allows America to slap tariffs on the territory’s exports, as it already does to those from the mainland. That is a powerful weapon, but the scope for miscalculation is vast, potentially harming Hong Kongers and driving out global firms and banks. It would be better, as the law also proposes, to impose sanctions on officials who abuse human rights in Hong Kong. Also, Britain should grant full residency rights to the hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers who hold a kind of second-class British passport—much as Ms Tsai this week opened Taiwan’s door to Hong Kong citizens. None of this will stop China from imposing its will on Hong Kong. The party’s interests always trump the people’s. ■"|1
2020-05-28|"Daniel Bicknell graduated in May 2020 with a Master in Public Policy degree from Harvard Kennedy School. He was a Belfer International and Global Affairs Student Fellow while at the Kennedy School. He holds an A.B. in Environmental Science and Public Policy from Harvard College and previously worked for Marstel-Day LLC, an environmental consulting firm, crafting policy and programs that balanced national security and sustainability requirements for U.S. Department of Defense clients.

Before attending HKS, Bicknell served as a Peace Corps Response volunteer in Peru, where he strengthened natural protected area co-management between Servicio Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas por el Estado (SERNANP) and indigenous community organizations. In the final year of the Obama administration, Bicknell also worked at the U.S. Department of Energy where he advanced scientific innovations through policy and partnerships.

While at HKS, Bicknell had the opportunity to take courses taught by esteemed professors such as David Keith's Policy for an Engineered Planet. In this class, he was able to learn more about the technology and policy of solar geo-engineering and its potential role in combating the climate crisis. He also researched gene drives for malaria eradication, pulling from theories and learnings from two other IGA courses: Professor Kathryn Sikkink's Global Governance and Professor Zoe Marks's Africa in Global Politics. In his final assignments, Bicknell combined the concepts he learned in each of these courses to explore gene drive accountability norms and standards, gene driving framing, and gene drive deployment decision-making processes.

Another class that stands out for Bicknell is IGA 224: Civil Resistance, in which Professor Erica Chenoweth emphasized the importance of having strategy decide campaign tactics, not the other way around. “I am grateful for having the opportunity to learn the strategy and frameworks in not only civil resistance but also in negotiations, political institutions, leadership, global governance, and sustainable development,” he says. “I have already applied new insights into the work that I am doing. Moving forward, I hope to put the work at the center and develop strategies that mobilize communities to combat the climate crisis and other social injustices.”

Bicknell also worked with Professor John Holdren and became involved in the Arctic Initiative. As part of the initiative, he served as a Course Assistant to IGA 671M: Social and Policy Innovations in the Changing Arctic. He explains that they were supposed to conduct a field experience in Greenland in collaboration with the University of Greenland. However, due to COVID-19, they switched to in-person collaboration online and conducted a virtual Greenland Policy Challenge. The program brought together 15 students from HKS and 10 students from the University of Greenland. Although the original plan had changed, Bicknell says that “the digital transition presented new opportunities to connect the global to the local (and ground Ivory Tower imaginations with experience-based knowledge), further enriching the IGA learning experience.”

After graduation, Bicknell has chosen to take advantage of a COVID-19 employment opportunity promoted through the Taubman Center for State and Local Government. “In light of the pandemic, I wanted to help the community respond to the crisis and prevent future waves of infection following graduation,” says Bicknell. “As a result, I joined Partners in Health as a Community Tracing Collaborative Contact Tracer Supervisor where I will support incredible colleagues working to keep Massachusetts residents healthy and slow the spread of COVID-19.”"|2

2020-05-28|"Editor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter. For more stories and our pandemic tracker, see our coronavirus hub

A passed a grim milestone: 100,000 deaths from a novel coronavirus that began to spread half a year and half a world away. Many Americans think their president has handled the epidemic disastrously, that their country has been hit uniquely hard and that there is a simple causal relationship between the two. The 100,000, which does not include excess deaths mistakenly attributed to other causes, is higher than any other country’s. It has routinely been compared with the 60,000 American casualties in the Vietnam war. A Trump Death Clock in Times Square purports to show how many lives the president’s ineptitude has cost: as we went to press it stood at 60,262. Yet this widespread conviction that America has failed because of Donald Trump is not supported by the numbers. Or, at least, not yet.

The official death rate in America is about the same as in the European Union—which also has excess deaths, but has less erratic leaders and universal health care. Overall, America has fared a bit worse than Switzerland and a bit better than the Netherlands, neither of which is a failed state. New York has been hit about as hard as Lombardy in northern Italy; California acted early and is currently similar to Germany; so far, rural states have, like central Europe, been spared the worst. This reflects two things, both of which will matter now that America is reopening before it has the virus fully under control.

The first is that covid-19, when it first hit, displayed an indifference to presidents and their plans. Around the world it has killed in large, dense and connected cities like New York, London and Paris, and where people are crammed together, including care homes, slaughterhouses and prisons. In some countries, including America, testing was snarled up in red tape.

Having seen what was happening in China, Mr Trump could have acted sooner—as Taiwan, Singapore and Vietnam did. He has failed to do things ordinarily expected of an American president in a crisis, such as giving clear government advice or co-ordinating a federal response. Instead, he has touted quack remedies and spent the days when America passed its sombre milestone spreading suspicion of the voting system and accusing a television host of committing a murder that never happened. All this is reprehensible and it may have been costly. Yet, tempting as it is to conclude that the president’s failures bear most of the blame for covid-19’s spread through America, the reality is more complicated (see Briefing).

That leads to the second feature of the country’s response to covid-19. The virus was always going to be hard on a population with high levels of poverty, obesity and diseases such as diabetes, especially among minorities (see Lexington). But, to a remarkable degree, other layers of government have adapted around the hole where the president should have been. The federal system has limited the damage, thanks to its decentralised decision-making. Lockdowns vary by state, city and county. California responded as soon as it saw cases. In the north-east governors largely ignored the White House and got on with coping with the disease, earning the Republican governors of Maryland and Massachusetts the president’s enmity, but high approval ratings. In Florida, though the governor was reluctant to impose a lockdown, county officials went ahead and did so anyway.

Contrary to demands for nationwide rules, this is a strength not a weakness, and will become more so as the pandemic runs its course. In the best-organised states, which have built up testing capacity, it helps ensure that flare-ups can be spotted quickly and rules adjusted accordingly. Because each region is different, that is more efficient than a nationwide approach.

One way democracies can deal with the virus is to draw on reserves of trust. People must behave in ways that protect fellow citizens whom they have never met, even if they themselves are feeling fine. Americans trust their local officials far more than the president or the federal government. And when it comes to public health those local officials have real power. Without this balancing feature, America might today look like Brazil, where a president with a similar love of hydroxychloroquine and distaste for face masks is wreaking havoc (see article).

If the public-health response in the United States so far matches Europe’s, its economic response to the virus may turn out better. True, the unemployment rate in America is 15%, double that in the . Yet in Europe most governments are protecting jobs that may no longer exist once lockdowns end rather than focusing help on the unemployed as America’s has. The is probably delaying a painful adjustment. Congress, not known for passing consequential legislation with big bipartisan majorities, agreed on a vastly bigger fiscal stimulus than in the financial crisis a decade ago. With a Democrat in the White House and a Republican-controlled Senate, America might not have mustered a response that was either so rapid or so large.

America still has a hard road ahead. Were daily fatalities to remain at today’s level, which is being celebrated as a sign that the pandemic is waning, another 100,000 people would die by the end of the year. To prevent that, America needs to work with the system it has, trusting local politicians to balance the risks of reopening against the cost of lockdowns.

In the next months the infrastructure built during the lockdown must prove itself. Because the virus has yet to decline in some states, it may flare up in new places, which will then need targeted lockdowns. The capacity to test, vital to spotting clusters of infection, has increased, but is still lacking in some places. Almost all the states lack the contact tracers needed to work out who needs testing and quarantining. When it considers how to withdraw fiscal support, Congress should remember this.

That America and Europe have fared similarly in the pandemic does not absolve Mr Trump. This is the first international crisis since 1945 in which America has not only spurned global leadership but, by cutting funds to the World Health Organisation, actively undermined a co-ordinated international response. That matters, as does Mr Trump’s inability to cleave to a consistent message or to speak to the country in words that do not enrage half of the population. Yet four years after Mr Trump was elected, the time to be surprised by his behaviour has long gone. Luckily, he has mattered less than most Americans think.■"|1

2020-09-09|"Michael D'Antonio is the author of the book ""Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success"" and co-author, with Peter Eisner, of the upcoming book ""High Crimes: The Corruption, Impunity, and Impeachment of Donald Trump."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) After Labor Day, President Donald Trump's reelection campaign will shift into high gear — but his plea for four more years is being drowned out by the outrage over charges largely confirmed by CNN that he called America's war dead ""suckers"" and ""losers.""

This, of course, is not Trump's first self-inflicted wound . It is merely the latest in a long list of scandals and revelations , which make the case that our impeached-but-not-convicted president is undeserving of reelection but also the worst president in US history.

After Trump's first term in the highest office, the US, in many ways, is unrecognizable. More than 189,000 have died of Covid-19 and the economy has collapsed. Much of the of the world now pities us for the poor leadership we must endure.

Trump has wounded the nation's psyche. He denigrates those who won't kowtow to him, including elected officials, the press and anyone who dares to challenge his actions. He does all this as he tries to claim excess power for himself. It feels to many like the US has become a nightmare. No wonder a recent Gallup poll found Americans are more politically divided than they have been in the over 80-year history of the poll.

It is audacious, of course, to suggest that someone is categorically the worst president in history, but it is no more audacious than Trump's own first-term claims to greatness, made with more than 20,000 untruths and deceptions documented in running fashion by the Washington Post. Trump is, remember, a man who said before the pandemic , ""George Washington would have had a hard time beating me.""

The President's most absurd claim — a main theme of his reelection campaign — is that he did everything he said he would do. His slogan , ""Promises Made, Promises Kept,"" is another lie. Among the promises he failed to fulfill are: building a border wall that Mexico would pick up the tab for, replacing Obamacare with something better, heavily investing in rebuilding our infrastructure, reducing the federal debt, ending trade deficits and creating vast numbers of jobs. In many cases, the good things that have happened during the Trump years depended on momentum created by his predecessors.

Trump's bizarre practice of simply declaring success when failure surrounds him reached a new crescendo as he accepted his party's nomination. His speech was so riddled with distortions and lies that CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale concluded he ""serially lied"" throughout it. Trump placed himself beside Abraham Lincoln in the American pantheon and described his challenger in ways that should be reserved for Lucifer himself.

Among the worst acceptance speech deceptions was Trump's claim that he moved decisively to stop the pandemic. To hear Trump tell it, he is the hero in this story and the virus will soon be behind us. In fact, 3,600 people died during the four days of the convention, as colleges and universities across the country reported new outbreaks as students tried to resume on-campus studies.

Under Trump, America, a nation with just 4% of the world's population, has suffered more than 20% of those killed in the pandemic. It is true, of course, that Trump did not begin this calamity, but by many estimates, he failed egregiously in his duty to do the best anyone could do to stop it. His has been an unforgivable, unfathomable failure of leadership, with catastrophic results.

As Americans died, often at a rate of more than 1,000 per day, Trump diverted attention to quack cures and unreliable speculations. He touted one treatment — hydroxychloroquine — that was soon shown to be not just ineffective but possibly dangerous, but not before the government bought 63 million doses. Standing at the White House podium, he mused about using household cleaners and sunlight to fight the virus which, I should not have to say, are not actual treatments.

The economic impact of the pandemic has been perhaps as devastating as the misinformation. In the most recent quarter, the US economy shrank by an estimated 32.9%, which was the worst fall ever recorded . (Yes, a worse economic contraction than any quarter of the Great Depression). Unemployment, which is a better measure of individuals' suffering, has also reached a record , bring with it all the anxiety that comes with the sudden loss of work and bill-paying security.

Of course, America has faced terrible times before. But when those crises brought death and suffering due to war, we could take comfort that some noble cause was part of the equation. In this case, nothing noble will be achieved by all this sacrifice. What about the pandemic of 1918? Yes, that outbreak did kill more Americans, but it occurred when scientists knew less about contagions and much less could be done for the sick. Trump, in contrast, had the public health resources of the richest country on earth at his disposal. Not only did he fail to use them, he actually attacked the experts at these agencies for trying to do their jobs.

Rick Bright, the federal doctor formerly overseeing Covid-19 vaccine development, said that he was pulled from that role after clashing with the administration's stance on hydroxychloroquine. The Centers for Disease Control was apparently under pressure by the President's team to change its guidelines for schools. Some at the CDC who once talked freely to reporters to help the American people understand threats to their well-being have withdrawn for fear of reprisals.

No one has been more mistreated by Trump than the nation's top expert on contagious disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, whom Trump has called ""alarmist"" and a man who ""made a lot of mistakes"" as an adviser on the crisis. It could be easily argued that no one in the world is more respected than Fauci when it comes to the science of pandemics, and yet Trump and his closest lieutenants have repeatedly undermined him. Trade adviser Peter Navarro even published an op-ed declaring , ""Anthony Fauci has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on.""

Perhaps the damage of the Trump era that will leave the longest-lasting mark is the political and social tumult he has fostered apart from the pandemic. Trump has used his pardon power to reward his cronies, stonewalled Congress as it sought to perform its oversight duties and crusaded against a press that he calls the ""enemy the people."" He turned federal officers on peaceful protesters and exaggerated unrest in big cities to demonize those exercising their right to demonstrate. With Election Day approaching, he has repeatedly predicted that fraud and chaos will accompany the vote.

It becomes an afterthought when compared to everything else, but let's not forget that Trump was only the third president to be impeached by the House of Representatives. It is difficult to name a president who has shown so little concern for so many of the people he is supposed to serve. This terrible quality was likely on the minds of the 157 presidential scholars who responded to a rank-the-presidents survey conducted in 2018 by Siena College. At that time Trump placed third from last, just ahead of Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan. Of course, this survey was completed before the pandemic, the recession that followed, and Trump's impeachment.

Coming out of the Republican convention, Trump signaled that we will get more of the same from him between now and November 3. He practiced his signature name-calling against the mayor of Portland, Oregon, resumed undermining the use of masks to protect public health, and demonstrated his contempt for mail-in voting by suggesting people vote twice — of course this is against the law — because the system may not work."|1

2020-05-28|"Japan, which unveiled a trillion-dollar stimulus to revive its Covid-19 and lockdown-hit economy in April, is reported to be planning another trillion-dollar stimulus. The new package includes direct subsidies for companies to help them cover cost of operations, health care aid for individuals, and financial assistance for local governments. The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said the total of the two packages will work out to around 40% of the country’s GDP. The fiscal cost of the package isn’t clear. HT’s analysis estimated that of the previous trillion-dollar package at around $454 billion or 9.13% of the country’s GDP.

The European Commission has also said it is working on a package of between €750 billion ($823 billion) and €1 trillion ($1.97 trillion) for the region, including a proposed 500 billion euro ($548 billion) fund that can be tapped by member-countries whose economies have been hit hard by the coronavirus disease pandemic.

The US Heroes Act, which promises $3 trillion in support, including another round of cheque payments to eligible Americans, is unlikely to be passed by the Senate, but there is talk that there will be a follow-up to the $2 trillion package announced in the CARES Act. Including monetary measures, HT’s Analysis calculates that the US has announced a total package of $6.8 trillion of which the fiscal cost is around $940 billion (this is a very conservative estimate and excludes loans and guarantees).

The consensus estimate for the fiscal cost of India’s $277 billion package is around $29 billion.

Plans for a second stimulus package underline a realisation in countries around the world that the impact of the pandemic and the lockdowns enforced by many countries to slow its spread – in the absence of a cure, a lockdown is the only way to break the chain of infections – will be harder than originally estimated. According to a Reuters poll of economists released on Wednesday, the global economy will shrink by 3.2% this year. A similar poll last month predicted that the decline would be 2%. The International Monetary Fund said in April that global growth would decline by 3% in 2020, and its managing director Kristalina Georgieva recently hinted that this could be revised down. But while this year will be worse than estimated, the economists polled by Reuters expect next year to be better. The poll said global growth could bounce back to 5.4% next year, up from the 4.5% predicted in April’s poll, although this is largely the base effect shining through.

In India too, the immediate impact on the economy is likely to be harder than expected. State Bank of India said in a research note on Tuesday that India’s GDP could contract 40% in the first three months of the year (April-June) and by 6.8% in the full year (2020-21). But it expects growth to bounce back once the country opens fully. Rating agency Crisil, which sees the country’s economy shrinking 5% in 2020-21, expects the first quarter to see a 25% fall in GDP.

Much depends on when the country reopens fully. And much also depends on when India starts flattening the curve – in terms of new cases of Covid-19, and in terms of daily deaths. Neither is happening right now: both the number of new cases and that of daily deaths are continuing to rise. And at some point in the next few months, India is going to have to start thinking in terms of a new package that can revive demand, put more money in the hands of individuals, and financially support businesses. It’s probably too early to talk of it – the ink on the documentation of the first package is yet to dry and many of the notifications related to it are yet to be issued – but developments in the US, Japan, and Europe clearly indicate that the economy needs more."|0
2020-05-28|"High levels of economic activity can foster the spread of communicable diseases through frequent person-to-person interactions. This column discusses how research on high levels of employment affects the spread of influenza and other viruses transmitted via droplet-spread, such as SARS-CoV-2. The results show that the high levels of employment in the US encourages the spread of influenza, especially when employment in service sectors are high. Our results provide support for social distancing measures aimed to slow the growth of cases of COVID-19.

Many of the characteristics or environments associated with modern daily work life may encourage the transmission of viruses, including seasonal influenza (the flu) and the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of Covid-19. These characteristics include commuting via public transportation, working in climate controlled indoor offices, sharing workspaces, and placing young children in daycare. If the features of the working environment promote the spread of the flu and other viruses, then being out of the labour force and away from these environments could help reduce the spread of diseases. This is the premise behind the current public health policies of closing down public places and requiring social distancing.

Early evidence suggests that these social distancing measures may be reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. Dave et al. 2020, Friedson et al. 2020, Courtemanche et al. 2020, Baldwin and Weder di Mauro 2020). However, because the COVID-19 pandemic is so recent, much of this evidence is based on only a few months of data. More evidence surrounding the effects of social distancing on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 could be gathered by studying the spread of similar viruses, namely the flu.

Evidence that high levels of employment are associated with high rates of seasonal flu

In a recently published article (Markowitz et al. 2019), we examine the relationship between economic activity, as measured by employment levels, and the spread of the flu in the US. We use state-level monthly employment rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and state-level monthly estimates of flu activity from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, spanning the 2010-2011 flu season up to the 2016-2017 flu season.

Our basic empirical strategy is to predict flu activity in a state and month as a function of the state’s employment levels in the previous month, as well as temperature and precipitation, and the previous month’s flu rate.

If our hypothesis is correct, we should expect that increases in employment in jobs with higher levels of interpersonal contact should be more related to the spread of the flu. Thus, we construct a measure of interpersonal contact levels for each industry sector using data from O*Net and construct employment measures at the industry level using data from the BLS Current Employment Statistics (CES) data set. We find that the two sectors with the highest levels of interpersonal contact are the retail and healthcare sectors, while the sectors with the lowest level of interpersonal contact are the construction and manufacturing sectors.

Figure 1 summarise the results from our regression models. We plot the increases in flu prevalence from an average monthly increase in overall employment and employment in sectors with high and low measures of interpersonal contact.

We find a strong positive association between employment and the spread of the flu, and the results suggest that an average monthly change in overall employment (about 0.33 percentage points) increases flu prevalence by about 6%. We find that employment changes in the retail and healthcare sectors, the two sectors with the highest levels of interpersonal contact, drive the aggregate results. The same average monthly increase in retail employment and healthcare employment would lead to much larger expected increases in flu prevalence of between 20% and 30%, respectively. Moreover, we find that employment changes in the construction sector, one of the sectors with the lowest level of interpersonal contact, is not associated with statistically significant changes in flu prevalence. Interestingly, changes in manufacturing employment lead to a large, but extremely imprecisely measured, increase in flu prevalence. This may be due to underlying heterogeneity in how different types of manufacturing employment either aid or are not related to the spread of the flu. We believe this remains an interesting question for future research.

Figure 1 Percent changes in flu prevalence from an average monthly increase in employment

These results are relevant for several reasons. First, barring major economic shocks, employment conditions can be forecast, to a fairly accurate degree, several months in advance. This information could be used by the public health community to plan for the severity of an upcoming flu season. For example, the 2017-2018 flu season was particularly severe. Hospitals found themselves unprepared and struggling to keep up with the influx of patients. As we have recently learned, the ability to predict the potential severity of future communicable diseases is vital information for hospitals and public health officials. In general, if the economy is on an upswing, the public health community should plan for an above normal increase in such diseases. The reverse will hold as well. This same logic can reasonably be applied to other droplet-spread, respiratory diseases, like COVID-19.

Furthermore, our results imply that employment in service industries – particularly retail and healthcare – is a particularly strong mechanism for flu spread. If our economy continues to shift to more service-oriented employment, the results presented here suggest there is greater potential for virus spread in the future. The statistically insignificant findings for industries such as construction with relatively low levels of interpersonal contact support the continuation of construction and infrastructure projects during periods of social distancing. Likewise, restrictions on retail business and non-essential medical visits are prudent considerations, as our results suggest activity in these industries is a significant source of viral infection. Lastly, employers should consider differences in the lost productivity from many employees becoming infected with viruses versus the lost productivity from a few infected individuals taking sick leave. Workers concerned about missing pay or losing their jobs as the result of staying home from work due to illness will be less likely to heed early signs of influenza or other viral infections and stay home. Since a person may be infectious while experiencing mild symptoms, this greatly increases the probability that the virus will spread to other workers in the firm. This implies that firms should consider more generous ‘sick day’ policies, particularly during the flu season. A recent working paper (Pichler et al. 2020) and a corresponding VoxEU column (Pichler and Ziebarth 2020), provide direct evidence of this hypothesis using variation in state-level mandated sick leave policies.

In this instalment of our series Dear Diary: In a Time of COVID-19, Sima Chowdhury tells us about fighting to see her mother in hospital, who ultimately made the decision she would be better off at home. This submission has been edited for clarity and length.

Hospitalized in Lethbridge with complications from pulmonary fibrosis during COVID-19, my mother had an isolation room containing a separate section for staff to don and doff personal protective equipment, a private bathroom, a television and beautiful natural light.

A room fit for a queen, as her attending physician affectionately called her. We were only allowed to see her in the room for ourselves when he didn't think she would survive the latest ordeal. During my visiting shift, she insisted on a selfie of us. Sharing the photo with my friends, they understood the seriousness of the situation.

With a strong will to live, my mother recovered enough to lose her ability to hold court with us in her hospital kingdom. Two of her favourite subjects were absent from these audiences.

My two nephews were too young to see her and expressed their frustration at COVID-19 for robbing them of the opportunity to see their grandmother for what could have been the last time. Despite her doctor's misgivings of an early release, ""The Queen"" decided to come home to see her grandchildren.

Meeting her needs at home requires a team effort. My sister and I drive from Calgary to ease the burden on our father, while nurses visit regularly to administer intravenous medications.
• Dear Diary: Driveway visits are nice, but this grandmother just wants a hug
• Dear Diary: An ER doctor opens up on what keeps him coming to work each day

My heart goes out to anyone who has to fight to see loved ones sick in the hospital. Healing comes in many forms, not just in medicines and vaccines, but in kindness, love, and hope from familiar faces.

The attending physician told my mom that having her family around aided her recovery. She went a step further to make sure she had access to us, whether or not her choice was medically approved.

Our health system needs to support a holistic approach for the vulnerable rather than wage germ warfare on those least able to advocate for themselves.

2020-05-28|"Gentry County has gone from three COVID-19 cases a week ago to now having 21 active cases as of Wednesday along with reporting its first COVID-19 death.

Officials with the Tri-County Health Department said a woman in her 90s died from COVID-19 this week.

The county now has what Tri-County Health Department officials described as a “cluster” of cases. Those officials declined to identify Wednesday where the cluster was centered, and staff at a facility cited on social media as one location with a number of cases also would not comment on the situation there.

Tri-County Health Department officials said the all active cases in Gentry County are resulting in mild symptoms and added they have performed contact tracing for those who have tested positive in the jump of new cases.

Lilli Parsons, director in Stanberry for the Tri-County Health Department, said staff have been informing citizens about social distancing through their Facebook page.

“We try to educate people all the time on the proper things to do and encourage people all the time on the proper things to do and to encourage people to stay at home and not gather, but sometimes it doesn’t go over very good,” Parsons said.

Parsons said she hopes the jump of numbers within the rural community will reinforce the need for people to be serious and cautious about what they are doing in regards to social distancing."|1
2020-05-29|"Covid, hysteresis, and the future of work

Has Covid accelerated the future of work? This column argues that Covid has changed the future of work via four shocks: massive job losses, massive digital transformations, massive debt burdens, and massive costs of socially distanced office space. These matter in two ways. First, due to sunk cost hysteresis, re-hiring workers is very different than retaining workers. Second, the digital transformations, office-space costs, and debt burdens will push firms to replace domestic workers with ‘telemigrants’ or ‘white-collar robots’. The jobs that return will be those that require face-to-face interactions and involve tasks that AI cannot handle.

Things have changed so much with Covid-19 that not even the future is what it used to be – or so it seems from all the predictions that analysts are making about the post-Covid world. But why should things change permanently? Things are the way they are for good reasons. If the reasons don’t change permanently, the outcomes won’t change permanently.

Actually, it is more complicated than that. Some socio-economic-political outcomes are governed by what might be called ‘rubber-band dynamics’, others by ‘paper-clip dynamics.’
• When you shock a rubber band – say, pull on it – the shape deforms, but the shape returns when you stop pulling. Temporary shocks have temporary effects.

Most economic phenomena are like this – the standard supply-and-demand mechanism, for instance.
• When you pull on a paper clip, it deforms but the shape doesn’t return when you stop pulling. Temporary shocks have permanent effects.

Technically, the two types of dynamics are called non-hysteretic (rubber band) and hysteretic (paper clip).

When thinking about how the Covid shock will change the future, we must focus on hysteretic processes. Generally speaking, hysteresis happens in systems where the level of some capital stock alters marginal costs or benefits. Here ‘capital’ includes simple versions like human, physical, and knowledge capital, or more complex forms like organisational capital, social trust, aspirations, and expectations. Different sources of hysteresis work with different types of shocks.

Covid-19 has profoundly shocked the economy in many ways. Four are particularly pertinent to the future of work.
• An epic number of people have lost their jobs.

In America the figure is almost 40 million. In Europe, fewer have been laid off, but millions have been dislodged from their usual employment relationships (Boeri et al 2020). Many of these separations will last for a few quarters at least.

This matters. Due to sunk costs, a firm’s decision to hire a worker is very different than its decision to retain a worker, and that’s why employment is a hysteretic process. The firings also matter since they boost the attractiveness of office-place automation – what I call ‘white collar robots’ in my 2019 book, The Globotics Upheaval. Automating service-tasks with, for example, robotic process automation (RPA) systems, chatbots, virtual assistants, or higher-end AI-systems is easier when you’ve already laid off the workers they are replacing.
• A large share of workers in Europe and America have learned to work remotely.

Estimates are that from 40-70% of workers in the US and Europe worked from home due to the pandemic (Berg et al 2020, Dingel and Nieman 2020, Brehan 2020). To make this possible, firms have invested in digital transformations – especially in the service sector. Companies have invested in hardware and bandwidth. Workers have learned how to use collaborative software, access remote databases, and participate in virtual meetings. Managers have learned how to manage virtual teams.

This matters since the human, physical, and organisational investments are not going away. And anything that makes it easier to telework domestically also makes it easier to telework internationally (what I called ‘telemigration’ in my book).

Now that telework is feasible for a hefty slice of their workforce, firms will soon realise that they can get some of the remote work done at much lower cost by hiring workers sitting in low-wage countries. While it is certainly true that foreign talent working online is unlikely to be as good as domestic talent working in the office, the foreign talent may be a whole lot cheaper. This is just service-sector globalisation, so the deeper point is Covid-linked changes are lowering the technical barriers to this type of globalisation.
• Office space in Europe and America got more expensive due to social distancing and other anti-contagion requirements.

This won’t last forever, but it is likely to be true during much of the recovery phase.

This matters since firms will face the cost-raising aspects while they are deciding whether to rehire workers in-house, to sink the costs of outsourcing the jobs (domestically or internationally), or to automate the positions using white-collar robots.
• Corporate and government balance sheets have already been hit hard by the Covid concussion; more red ink is predicted for many quarters to come.

This matters since firms will be under pressure to cut costs in the short and medium term. Using ‘remote intelligence’ (RI) like telemigrants and artificial intelligence (AI) like white-collar robots will be one way of reducing expenses.

The post-Covid employment landscape: What can’t RI and AI do?

As the world returns to normal, private and public employers will have to decide which sorts of workers they want, and how many of them – starting from something of a tabula rasa. Some may decide to just go back to doing things the old way. But on the margin, the investment in remote work capacity will surely result in fewer workers in offices.

So, what jobs won’t be replaced by RI or AI? Applying the logic I developed in The Globotics Upheaval, the jobs that will return are those that are intensive in the sorts of tasks that (1) can’t be done remotely, and (2) can’t be done by white-collar robots. In other words, the way to think about the future of work post-Coivd-19 is to use a process of elimination. The question then is: What can’t RI and AI do? I have a couple of chapters on this in my book, but here’s the gist.

As it turns out, humans have unique advantages over white-collar robots in things like judgement, empathy, intuition, creativity, ethics, curiosity, and comprehension of complex interactions among teams of humans. Psychologist call this ‘social cognition’ and we have it for very specific, very deep-seated reasons. Michael Tomasello’s book, The Cultural Origin of Human Cognition, asserts that social cognition allowed humans to live in large groups where survival turned on the ability of individuals to cooperate in a complex web of relationships involving trust, kinship, and dominance. The equipment for this is hardwired into the human brain.

Machine learning has problems with social cognition, as I point out at length in my book. First, even today’s computers aren’t powerful enough given the combinatoric aspects of social interactions. Second, we don’t have the right kind of data to train the white-collar robots. Third, machine learning techniques are a shallow imitation of the biology of human learning, so it may be that a whole new computer-science approach is needed if machines are to rival humans in the most human skills (Lake et al. 2017).

What kind of jobs can’t be done by telemigrants? Clearly, work that requires local or culture-specific knowledge will be hard to do from overseas. More generally, the key is to think hard about why face-to-face communication matters. Since verbal communication is almost costless these days, a good place to start is nonverbal communication – a topic that is widely studied by psychologists.

When people are face-to-face in the same room, psychological experiments suggest that less than 30% of the information exchanged stems from the words spoken – some communication researchers put the number as low as 7%. The rest is nonverbal. One clear upshot of this is that forming trust is much easier with face-to-face communication since it is easier to lie with words than it is to lie face-to-face. This is exactly why we trust people more when they say things straight to our face.

Almost ten years ago, Alan Blinder classified jobs according to offshore-ability, finding that something like 40% could be done remotely. The sectors where less than 20% of the jobs were offshorable – that is, could be done by telemigrants – were mostly of the have-to-be-there type: jobs in hotels and restaurants, transportation and warehousing, construction, leisure industries, education, and health and social care. The most vulnerable sectors to telemigrants were professional, scientific and technical sectors, and the finance, industry, and media sectors. More recently, Dingel and Neiman (2020) came up with the figure that 37% of US jobs could be done remotely.

Most service-sector and professional jobs have been sheltered from globalisation (i.e. remote intelligence) and white-collar robots (i.e. artificial intelligence) since face-to-face interactions were important and computers couldn’t think. That has been changing progressively as digital technology has advanced.

Pushed by Covid-19, firms and workers have invested in, say, ten years’ worth of digital transformation in just a few months. My guess is that this will accelerate the trend towards more service sector jobs coming into competition with ‘globotics’, i.e. telemigrants working in our offices while sitting abroad (the globalisation part), and software robots replacing particular office-tasks (the robotics part). The jobs that survive competition from telemigrants will be those that require face-to-face interactions. The jobs that survive competition from white-collar robots will be those that stress humanity’s great advantages.

2020-05-29|"Strikers gathered in Aotea Square for a rally and march down Queen Street Auckland as a call for action on climate change.

Auckland Council proposes major cuts across the board including to climate change action, scaling back services, jobs, and access to some facilities in the face of a $525 million budget hit due to Covid-19.

Few areas of the council operations are spared with proposed cuts to some public transport services, the electrification of the bus fleet, and community spending as the council faces going into deficit for the first time in its 10-year history.

In a second three-week round of public consultation on the hastily re-shaped budget, the council said cuts would be deeper if Aucklanders opted for the lower-than-planned option of a 2.5 per cent rate rise.

The council said operating costs would have to be cut by a further $54 million under a 3.5 per cent rates rise or by $75 million under the lower 2.5 per cent option.

""Both packages will result in noticeable changes to what we are providing to the community and to the level of staff we employ,"" it said in the public consultation document just released.

Other moves to keep the books as close to balanced as possible, include the sale of $200 million of unspecified assets, likely to be non-strategic or surplus property.

The council said it was juggling the need to cut spending, with unexpected costs it will face.

""A current example is the drought situation, for which Watercare may need to soon invest $50 million to $180 million in critical water supply infrastructure,"" it said.

Transport-related revenue is expected to be down by $113 million, and part of the gap could be closed by a 4 per cent public transport fare rise in February, one of the biggest-ever by Auckland Transport.

There will be $37 million transport operating budget cut across staffing, contractors, and cuts to the frequency and level of some services.

Unusually, an often-suggested move, charging for some park and ride car parks, would occur only if a lower, 2.5 per cent rate rise was implemented.

Transport spending being cut or put back includes road safety improvements, red-light camera roll-outs at intersections, and all cycling and walking projects not yet in construction.

The already-criticised slow roll out of electric buses will be further delayed, with only three to be added on the Puhinui-Airport route this year.

A post Covid-19 construction slowdown is expected to show up as a 25 per cent - 35 per cent reduction in the number of building and resource consents, resulting in a $50 million drop in revenue.

Cuts in staff numbers and costs, and internal efficiencies in the Environmental Services, Waste Services and Regulatory Services departments is expected to save $3.43 million.

Staff cuts and other savings in the Parks and Community area is due to save $6.49 million.

Mayor Phil Goff said none of the proposed budget cuts were easy to make.

""There was nothing in the budget before Covid-19 that was frivolous or superfluous, so everything that has been cut was important,"" he told Stuff.

The development agency Panuku would have to cut its running costs by $3 million, and slowing down city centre and local centre developments would save $2.4 million.

Big cuts include deferring $162 million of capital works in the water and wastewater area.

Most upgrades and replacements of community buildings and playgrounds is frozen, and under a 2.5 per cent rate rise scenario, some lesser-used facilities would close permanently.

There will be fewer and smaller council-backed events such as Matariki, Waitangi Ki Manukau, Movies in Parks, Music in Parks, and the Heritage Festival.

Goff held out hope that some funding may flow from the Government's various Covid-19 responses, such as helping to fund ""shovel ready"" projects, but that was still unknown.

""I can't say that anything we are having to defer for a year, is something we did not need,"" he said.

Despite the cuts, the council was still proposing capital expenditure of $2.3 billion, while lower than the previously planned $2.7b, it was far higher than the five-year average of $1.6b.

Aucklanders have until Friday June 19 to have their say on the reduced council budget."|0
2020-05-29|"The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has said it will not increase the daily expenses allowance for asylum seekers following a request for the weekly payment to be temporarily increased by €20 during the Covid-19 pandemic.

More than 40 organisations, legal professionals and academics working with asylum seekers in Ireland wrote to the Minister for Employment and Social protection Regina Doherty in early May asking for additional financial support for people in direct provision during the health crisis.

The group expressed concern that people seeking protection were not entitled to the State’s short term Covid-19 financial support and that they remained “exceptionally vulnerable” during the crisis.

Many asylum seekers are facing additional costs including increased spending on children who would normally be at school, cleaning items, medicine and food, said the letter to the minister. Many direct provision residents who would usually use free Wi-Fi in libraries, are spending more money on mobile data to access public health guidance online, it added.

The letter also urged the department to reconsider its decision not to make the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) available to people in direct provision.

While some asylum seekers who lost work because of the coronavirus initially received the State support measure, payments to people living in direct provision stopped after a couple of weeks and residents were put back on the €38.80 weekly allowance (€155.20 per month) for adults in the asylum system. Children in direct provision receive €29.80 each week.

In a letter dated May 15th and seen by The Irish Times, Ms Doherty responded that there were no plans to reinstate the Covid-19 payment to asylum seekers in direct provision who had lost work.

Any increases to the rate of the daily expenses allowance would have to be approved by Government and “considered in a budgetary context”, she said.

Protection applicants living in direct provision receive food, accommodation and other services as well as the weekly allowance while the PUP is paid to “people, who in most cases, have no other source of income”, said Ms Doherty in the letter.

Asylum seekers living outside direct provision are eligible for PUP, she added.

The minister noted that under measures introduced in response to the pandemic, asylum seekers could stay with friends or family on a temporary basis while retaining their place within the accommodation system and continuing to receive the weekly stipend.

Asylum seekers can also access exceptional needs payments, with payments made at the discretion of officers administering the scheme, she said. Any asylum seeker who requires financial assistance should contact the community welfare service that deals with their accommodation centre, added the minister.

Irish Refugee Council director Nick Henderson said he was disappointed by the minister’s response and that the group would continue to campaign for the increased financial support.

An additional €20 per week would enable direct provision residents to buy extra hand sanitiser, face masks, phone data or home schooling tools, said Mr Henderson. “Rejecting this request on the grounds that it is a budgetary matter and would need to be approved by Government ignores the seismic changes that have already been made to this year’s budget,” he said. “Increasing the allowance by this amount would go some way in showing we truly are all in this together.”"|1
2020-05-29|"I suspect many teachers are recoiling from the phrase “the new normal”. There is nothing normal about remote teaching and the idea that it can become a long-term replacement for the classroom or lecture hall is anathema to most in education. Also worrying is the possibility that those in charge of third-education institutions, even more starved of resources than they were before Covid-19, will see remote or “blended” teaching as a new, cheaper, streamlined way of delivering “output”, rendering the university campus almost redundant.

Arising out of the current crisis, there is a danger of a whole new language around online educational “provision” being added to the layer of corporate management speak that has long pervaded the Irish education system. In 2015, a senior UCD administrator sent this message to the university staff: “Strategic Initiative 6 is concerned with consolidating and supporting efforts across our community to enhance agility and effectiveness in university process improvement, thereby continuously furthering value for the UCD community and process beneficiaries whilst simultaneously empowering faculty and staff to proactively engage in continuous process improvement initiatives”.

Those with a high pain threshold can reread that “sentence” several times, but it will remain what it is: a grotesque subversion of the notion of a third-level community. This jargon is a product of a trend historian Tom Dunne had written about two years earlier: “like a deadly, odourless gas, the elements of a quiet revolution have seeped through every area of Irish education during recent years, poisoning the atmosphere . . . a relentless application of market principles . . . has shifted the focus of education from the development of the individual and the benefits flowing from this to society to the service of the economy, narrowly conceived”.

This took on added pace in the aftermath of the last economic collapse with an insistence that “applied research” needed to be the main priority. Teachers were increasingly seen as “service providers”, the students as “service users” and the university leaders and reams of bureaucrats as “managers”. The casualisation of academic labour and short-term contracts further embedded an insecurity that is the antithesis of an academic “community” and hinders creativity. There has also been a preoccupation with what is offensively labelled “performance for growth” by university management as if the educators were stocks and shares. Parallel to this are obsessions with “impact”, “globalisation” and ensuring a flow of money from China. Recently, UCD management sought to change the university’s policy on academic freedom to allow for “different interpretations” of the concept due to its links with China, the idea being that if UCD continues to “strengthen its international engagement” and partnerships with other universities overseas, it should seek to accommodate “divergent approaches to academic freedom”. After a backlash, the proposed changes were withdrawn.

When I was an undergraduate, the president of UCD was a philosopher. The chances of such an appointment today are negligible. How old-fashioned it appears now to strive for a university that is a pleasant place in which to work and study, with pride in its self-made identity and producing independent thinkers who can conserve, create and transmit knowledge.

There is an onus on those in humanities – as in other areas – to effectively communicate the public value of their research; the university is supposed to be a public good and those in it have responsibilities as public servants. But so do those administering education and now is the time to think about that.

From mid-March, educators responded to an emergency as best they could by switching everything online to get the academic year over the line. And that seemed to be the overwhelming priority; in the same way, the discourse about this year’s Leaving Cert students seemed to be solely about the exams and what course place might come after, relegating discussion of the problems in the system as it stands, with or without Covid-19. A Higher Education Authority Report of 2018 highlighted that one in six third-level students drops out of their course during their first year, and as pointed out by Brian Mooney this week, that figure is likely to increase due to the panic and uncertainty prevalent this year for those hoping to go on to third level. An acceptance, or worse still, embracing of remote teaching as the norm can only exacerbate that problem; students need to learn and thrive through direct engagement not only with their course material but also with their lecturers and fellow students.

It is not more technology and regularising of remoteness that is needed coming out of this crisis. It is imperative that our universities are properly funded, but we do not need a new obsession with what I saw this week described as “crisis-driven innovation; adaptation through technology”. The danger is that this will further entrench the notion of “delivering” rather than teaching."|1
2020-05-29|"I am a postdoctoral researcher studying retinal diseases and was recently awarded a career transition grant to start my own lab. My search for a faculty position was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. I started sending out applications in January 2020, and found out in March that my planned interviews across several US states coincided with campus closures. The interviews were postponed indefinitely.

I reached out to four potential employers, and we agreed to conduct online interviews. Conducting a full-day interview online was new both to me and to the interviewers, but over the past eight weeks, I’ve got lots of hands-on experience. Here’s what I learnt.

Coronavirus and COVID-19: Keep up to date

Ask for an itinerary. Just as with an in-person interview, it’s important to have a sense of what your day is going to look like. I made sure I knew who I would be meeting and what they were planning to go over. Your potential employer will probably send a series of links to connect to the scheduled meetings.

I made sure I had room in my itinerary to disconnect, reconnect and troubleshoot technical glitches between meetings. I also scheduled breaks throughout the day, and a long break for lunch to mentally disengage and stretch out. In practice, this meant I had 5 minutes between every ‘back-to-back’ meeting, plus 15-minute breaks every couple of hours, and an hour for lunch.

Test the connection. Before the interviews, I asked my potential employers what videoconferencing tool they were using, and downloaded the program to my computer (often there is a web version but, in my experience, the downloadable app tends to be more stable and come with more options). I familiarized myself with it by setting up a call with a friend so I could explore the program’s features and get input. I also asked the meeting administrator for a test session a few days before the actual interview to make sure I could share my audio, video and seminar slides properly.

Set up your meeting room. I was going to be sitting in the same spot for the whole interview, so I made sure to choose a quiet, well-lit room.

As lockdowns ease, you might be able to conduct the interview from your lab, but if you are still at home, ask those you live with to be quiet and respect your space for the day. If you go into the office or are in a shared living space, put a sign on the doorknob making it clear that you shouldn’t be disturbed. If you have children or pets that might make noise, let your interviewers know ahead of time. Try not to let it worry you — we’re all getting used to background noises under lockdown and your interviewers are not going to judge you on your children’s ability to keep quiet. In my case, I headed into my lab, following social- distancing guidelines, and informed my colleagues of the interview beforehand.

Prepare your environment. I was careful to adjust the camera to be at my eye level. Some meeting programs provide a virtual background or let you upload one from your desktop, but I used the neutral wall in my lab because it felt more natural. I also chose to face the door to anticipate any surprise entrances. Make sure you have what you need next to you, such as your itinerary, a pen and paper, and your CV.

Embrace Murphy’s law: ‘Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong.’ In my case, it was the Wi-Fi signal. Halfway into a seminar, I had to move to another room to find an ethernet cable and continue my presentation. It was disruptive, but I hope the interviewers took it as a sign of resilience and working through unusual circumstances. If it’s an option, a back-up technical plan and computer is a good idea.

Dress up. In an online interview, you do not have personal interaction, and therefore you want to give the best impression possible through your tiny computer camera. I made sure I dressed as if I was going to meet my prospective employer in person. Professional attire has a positive impact and helped to remind me to behave in a polished manner — I’ve found it too easy to drop the professionalism in front of a webcam, because you don’t feel the same social pressure you might in a face-to-face interview. Dress well from top to bottom and do not rely on the fact that the camera shows only your upper body. You might need to stand up or walk with your laptop from one room to another, as I did.

Communicate clearly. When I faced connection problems during my conversations and seminar, I tried to explain in a calm and timely manner. I had a mobile phone on hand, and had exchanged numbers with the meeting administrator in case I needed to troubleshoot problems. I tried to pause at appropriate points during my seminar, to make sure everyone was following and connected. In one of the sessions, I was talking to two faculty members who could see me and each other, but I could not see them owing to a software glitch. I made sure to check they were still available, and let them know that I could only hear them. There were other clumsy moments — often it felt like a choice between interrupting an interviewer or letting dead silence fill the air for a moment. In these moments, I made sure to keep a big smile on my face and talked only after the other side had completely finished and paused for couple of seconds.

Before I accept a job offer, I hope I will eventually be able to visit the facilities and lab space in-person — an important consideration that can’t be solved by videoconferencing. But overall, I found online interviewing much less tiring and stressful than onsite visits. I had many more opportunities to rest outside individual meetings, which I wouldn’t have had in the ‘real world’. And I had none of the travel commitments that might have been burdensome before lockdown.

Be prepared to be told that your potential employer will not be hiring until COVID-19 loosens its grip. Be patient, positive and understanding. Remember that this is a difficult time for everyone — and your potential employers will probably do the same for you."|2

2020-05-30|"OPINION: The scale and pace of change today is extraordinary. For years companies have been preparing for forces of disruption such as shifting regulations, digitisation, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI), but the sudden impact of Covid-19, a single force, caught the world off guard.

When a fundamental challenge for companies is to predict when and where disruption is coming from, Covid-19 arrived and managed to disrupt business models, air travel, supply chains and work-life balance around the world in less time than it takes to complete a 30-day fitness challenge.

No-one knows exactly what lasting impact Covid-19 will have on the economy and supply chains, amongst other things, but we are already seeing and living the societal changes that will undeniably have lasting impacts. Whether it’s moving more of our lives online, new hygiene habits, greater comfort with absenteeism, a revived gratitude for the great outdoors, a new form of nationalism as we hail our essential workers or simply a re-kindled appreciation for plunger coffee, the novel virus is already reorienting our relationship to the outside world and each other.

How quickly the new habits and awareness will recede (if ever) as the lockdown eases is uncertain and it will be different for different people, but we need to acknowledge that many things that were once ignored have been overturned by necessity, so we are destined for some permanent change.

Amid all this change and uncertainty, how can organisations best understand the new way of being-in-the-world and doing-in-the-world to achieve lasting impact?

There are a myriad of perceptions floating around about the future of physical workspaces and business models as a result of the lockdown and working from home (WFH). While it’s important to understand what actions other companies are considering, there’s no ‘quick fix’ or ‘one size fits all’ response. What we shouldn’t do is leave it unattended and only assume that disruption will have a negative impact.

The best thing organisations can do is re-discover; re-open the dialogue with their workforce (and customer base) to seek out opportunities.

At a time overcome with physical disconnection, now, more than ever is the time to listen. Everyone’s experience of being an employee during Covid-19 will be different. We’ve seen organisations that were once opposed to the idea of working from home, suddenly make it a top priority. People are managing the competing roles of employee, parent, caregiver and teaching assistant. Others may have worked the whole lockdown at their place of work, apprehensive as the rest ride it out in the safety of their home. In times of adversity, values and priorities shift; and employees are sure to request changes. This means organisations must relearn about their workforce.

Using digital and interactive tools, organisations can gather meaningful data and insight on workforce sentiment to recognise, understand and anticipate change. The insight will likely nod to things you already do well, but also opportunities and things that you might need to learn from scratch. Employee surveys will provide you with immediate, evidence-based insight which will help dispel old assumptions and help you understand your employee’s home working experience.

So, what questions should you be asking?

If you’re not asking the right questions, you’re at risk of diving into a treasure trove of statistics and statements and emerging with less than meaningful answers. Track what matters and that is your employees. Employees are the champions who underpin the success of your organisation, now is the time to ensure their needs are front and centre. So, hone in on the experience.

If we could read minds, we could in principle shape perfect experiences and keep experiences current, but we can’t. What we can do is listen with qualitative surveys and polls. This means, rather than measuring how employees do their work from home, delve into how employees feel about their work and new-found work environment and remote working practices. As intangible and evolving as culture can be, ask about it. Seek to understand employees’ sense of belonging, purpose and connectedness when working remotely. Understand not only how employees are directing energy towards their tasks but towards colleagues, collaborators and customers.

This feedback will help to discover what employees value, what the obstacles and enablers are, where there are opportunities for innovation and flexibility and even allude to the complementary aspects of office and home. It goes without saying that you cannot measure everything, but a suite of good metrics allows you to get a pretty good picture of what is actually happening and where opportunities lie. Above all else, taking the initiative to ask for candid feedback shows leadership and solidarity during these challenging times.

To close the loop, you must be prepared to act.

Then the information needs to be used to take action. Just as you can’t measure everything, not every piece of feedback is going to prove that your intuition is right or offer straightforward solutions. Action can be as simple as sharing the findings with your employees or sending out a newsletter to answer common concerns. If findings point toward larger changes, there’s the ability to rely on further research and workshops that are curated to unearthing practical solutions.

It’s hard to predict the precise effects, but organisations should look for ways that empower them to be optimistic, agile, and prepared.

When disruption is so extensive and effects so unpredictable it is hard to differentiate setbacks from opportunities, but we need to acknowledge that standards we used to live by have been overwritten and some may never apply again. Information is incredibly valuable and having more information is only a good thing. Having data will help make the uncertainty a bit more certain. It will provide immediate, robust insight to help you navigate through this challenging time and enable you to scale your efforts towards a changed and fresh future.

3 Things to Consider When Purchasing a Security System

Joe Anderson

Founder

Reflex Protect

""Before purchasing a security system: 1) Do your research. Ask family, friends and coworkers what they use and like, and read reviews. In addition, many police crime-prevention units and fire departments have alarm specialists who you can connect with for advice. 2) It's very important to go with a reputable company. When an alarm sounds, you want to be completely assured that your system is going to function as it should. 3) Remember, this is a long-term investment for your home. You don't need to break the bank, but you also don't want to go with bottom of the barrel. At the end of the day, a system that provides daily peace of mind and is a deterrent to would-be criminals is the goal.""

In 1993, on a Thursday just before 3 p.m., Joe Anderson was in a deposition when a gunman entered his former law firm Pettit & Martin in San Francisco. That day, nine of Joe's friends and colleagues lost their lives. Joe was shocked, in a state of disbelief. In the following years, Columbine, Sandy Hook, and The Pulse nightclub shootings all occurred, and all Joe could think was ""How can we stop this from ever happening again?"" So, when his friend, co-founder and inventor Steve came to him with the idea for the Reflex Protect® product, he thought, ""I wish this had been in the receptionist's hands 25 years earlier; it might have changed everything."" Reflex Protect® is a safety company dedicated to providing highly effective non-lethal products and training for where you live, work, worship, and play. In short, it's a highly effective yet non-violent alternative for violent situations. Learn more at www.ReflexProtect.com.

2020-05-30|"The short-run macro implications of school and childcare closures

The COVID-19 crisis has hit women’s employment particularly hard, partly because the worst-hit sectors have high female employment shares, but also because schools and daycare closures have forced more mothers to leave their jobs. This column looks at Germany, where 26% of the workforce has children aged 14 or younger, and quantifies the macroeconomic importance of working parents. If schools and daycare centres remain closed as the economy slowly reopens, 11% of workers and 8% of all working hours will be lost to the labour market. Policies to restart the economy must accommodate the concerns of these families.

Economies around the world are facing massive job losses – numbers in many countries are approaching those of the Great Depression in the 1930s. The unemployment rate in the US already reached 14.7% in April 2020, and real-time surveys put it as high as 24% during the week of 10–16 May (Bick and Blandin 2020).

Unlike in normal business cycles, where fluctuations in hours are driven largely by men (Doepke and Tertilt 2016), the COVID-19 recession has hit the employment of women particularly hard – partly because sectors with high female-employment shares (such as retail and tourism) have been strongly affected, but also because schools and daycare closures forced some mothers to leave their jobs (Alon et al. 2020, Torrejón et al. 2020).

Germany has been impressively sheltered so far. The unemployment rate in April 2020 stands at only 5.8%, but employers rely massively on short-term work. Among workers employed in January, 13% are either on short-term work or employed but not working, as of 24 May (Blom et al. 2020), while 28% of the workforce is working fully or partly from home.

We explore the labour market consequences of slowly ‘reopening’ the economy and increasing the demand for physical presence at the workplace, assuming schools and childcare centres remain at least partly closed. We first report what fraction of the workforce live with children in the household and then estimate what fraction of workers have to provide childcare if schools and childcare centres do not reopen to the extent the economy does. We also estimate what fraction of total hours will be lost in the labour market and find that the macroeconomic impact due to parents’ inability to work is likely large.

We use data from the 2018 European Labour Force Survey and consider all individuals aged 20 and older for the labour force. Rather than relying on detailed microdata on childcare arrangements, we follow Dingel et al. (2020) and estimate what percent of the workforce is affected by school and childcare closings based on pre-crisis data on employment, hours, and children across households. We assume that children aged 14 or younger cannot be left unsupervised alone at home.

While many behavioural responses can be expected after a large shock, adjusting the presence of children in the household seems near impossible in the short-run. Further, most margins that working parents use in normal times (such as hiring babysitters, sharing childcare duties with neighbours and friends, or relying on grandparents) are currently either explicitly banned by state law or at least highly discouraged. Thus, the most likely margin of adjustment to the closures is that one adult per household will stop working.

We start by looking at the share of employed workers with children aged 14 or younger in their households. Figure 1 shows that a notable proportion of the German workforce have children: one out of four employed workers (25.9%) have children at home. This number of workers is larger than the combined share of all workers in the German manufacturing and construction sector in 2019 (22.8%).

Figure 1 Childcare obligations of the employed in Germany

Comparing the first two bars in Figure 1, we see that 4% of households with children also include a non-working adult (such as a non-working mother, an older sibling, or grandparents). Assuming that these non-working adults could take over childcare and home-schooling obligations, we still find that one in five employees (21.2%) are without childcare if school and childcare centres remain closed.

Next, we estimate the share of workers who will be unable to work due to childcare obligations, assuming that one adult will stay home in each household. This share of employed workers therefore corresponds roughly to half of the couple households plus the share of single households.

In total, we estimate that about 11% of workers would have to stay at home, with 9% of these workers living in couple households and 2% being single parents. To put this number into perspective, we compare it to the unemployment rate of 5.8% in April 2020. Even if all unemployed workers in Germany found work immediately, this would just fill half the jobs potentially left vacant due to parents’ inability to work.

Couples can, and likely will, optimise when choosing who will stay at home. Within each household with childcare obligations, we identify the household member with the lowest regular hours of work and assume that this person will stay at home. This results in a total 8.4% reduction of work hours, of which 6.8% stem from workers in couple households and 1.6% from single parents. Within couple households, we find that in 82% of households, mothers work fewer hours than fathers. Thus the majority of hours lost to the labour market will likely be in female-dominated occupations.

Table 1 reports the same numbers separately for children above and below the school-entry age of 6, allowing us to separately assess work hours lost due to school closures and to daycare closures. For example, if schools reopen but daycare centres stay closed, still 9.8% (=6.3%+3.5%) of the employed are affected in that they have no caregiver in the household. If instead daycare centres reopen but schools stay closed, 15% (=11.5%+3.5%) of the employed have a childcare problem.

To gauge the macroeconomic effects, we compare the 8.4% lost hours to a popular policy instrument to deal with labour underutilisation, namely, short-time work. Short-time work programmes were prevalent during the Global Financial Crisis and are also heavily used now. In 2009, more than 1.1 million workers were on short-time work with an hours’ reduction of about one-third of their working time (28.1%). In other words, during the Global Financial Crisis, 3.1% of all employed workers were on short-time work and their hours’ reduction accounted for 1% of total hours worked in 2009.5

While these were massive programmes, the numbers are dwarfed by parents’ likely reduction in work hours during the current crisis. Based on the numbers in Table 1, we estimate that close to four times as many workers and more than eight times the share of hours would be lost due to parents’ inability to work due to childcare obligations.

Even if we overestimate the share of affected hours – because some children can stay alone for some time, some parents can work from home while simultaneously taking care of their children, or some other childcare arrangements like sharing between families or involving grandparents are used – it is clear that the impact of the childcare and school closings on hours worked is large. Most of the reduction of hours will likely come from women.

From a macroeconomic perspective, the labour supply of parents who would have to stay home if economic activity fully resumes but schools and childcare facilities remain closed is massive. We estimate the share of affected employed workers to be close to twice the number of all unemployed workers in Germany, and their share in hours worked is eight times the work reduction due to short-time work during the Global Financial Crisis.

While we acknowledge that workers might find creative solutions to organise childcare to best deal with this situation, the macroeconomic labour-supply effects are still so large that policy seems well advised to take parents’ labour-market situation into account when developing plans for restarting the economy.

While this column focuses on the current labour supply of parents, it is important to emphasise the potential long-run distributional and growth consequences that missing school and childcare has for society – consequences of less education, a decrease in intergenerational mobility, and the hurdles they put in the way of women forced to deal with career interruptions (von Gaudecker et al. 2020, Furceri et al. 2020, Burgess and Sievertsen 2020).

We find that in 82% of couples, the mother is working fewer hours and will likely step in to handle additional childcare needs (see also Jessen and Waights 2020). First numbers from real-time surveys in Germany confirm this assumption (Adams-Prassl et al. 2020, Möhring et al. 2020). Bayer and Kuhn (2020) demonstrate that starting at age 30, when children are young and need childcare, the gender-career gap opens up and contributes 50% to the gender pay gap 20 years later. School and childcare closures today will thus likely negatively affect intergenerational mobility and gender equality in the workplace.

2020-05-30|"Non-performing loans are a crucial policy consideration, especially in times of wider economic crisis. This article uses a new database covering 88 banking crises since 1990 to draw lessons for post-COVID-19 resolution of non-performing loans. Compared to the 2008 crisis, the pandemic poses some different challenges. Despite some respite from the credit-crash of 2008, policymakers today are faced with substantially higher public debt, less profitable banks, and often weaker corporate sector conditions, making resolution of non-performing loans even more challenging.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy has come to a sudden halt. This is likely to bring about high levels of non-performing loans (NPLs), i.e. loans that are in (or close to) default. High NPLs are problematic because they impair bank balance sheets, depress credit growth, and delay economic recovery (Aiyar et al. 2015, Kalemli-Ozcan et al. 2015). Persistently high NPL ratios were a concern in several European countries after the 2008-2012 crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic could cause a re-emergence of the NPL problem.

High NPLs are a common feature of banking crises and tend to be studied around such events. Data presented in an existing report by Laeven and Valencia (2013) shows that NPL levels peak during crises, but more data are needed to understand how NPLs evolve and are resolved. Our recent ECB working paper (Ari et al., 2020) bridges this gap by presenting a new dataset on yearly NPL evolution during 88 banking crises since 1990. The dataset covers major regional and global crises (including the Nordic crisis, the Asian financial crisis, the Global Financial Crisis) and many standalone crises in developing, transition, and low-income economies. For each crisis, we report NPLs over an 11-year window around the crisis. What do we learn from these data?

During crises, NPLs typically follow an inverse U-shaped pattern. They start at modest levels, rise rapidly around the start of the crisis, and peak some years afterwards, before stabilising and declining. Looking at all crises, we see that NPL levels peak at about 20% of total loans on average, but the variance is large (especially in developing countries, where NPLs can exceed 50% of total loans). Only less than a fifth of banking crises avoid high NPLs, which we define as NPLs exceeding 7% of total loans.

Anticipating future levels of NPLs is key for formulating NPL resolution strategies. It is tempting to use pre-crisis NPLs to anchor such forecasts. Yet, pre-crisis NPL levels are not a good indicator of post-crisis NPL problems. After a crisis, NPLs increase to three times their pre-crisis values on average, and over ten times in extreme cases (Figure 1).

Note: Reproduced from Ari, Chen, and Ratnovski (2020), Figure 4. The chart shows peak NPLs for 88 banking crises since 1990. The left panel shows peak NPLs expressed as percent of total loans; the right panel shows peak NPL ratio (i.e. NPLs/total loans) expressed as a multiple of the pre-crisis NPL ratio. Crises that did not have high NPLs (with NPLs under 7% of total loans) are shown in light blue in the left panel.

Timely NPL resolution is difficult, but essential for economic recovery

Countries can facilitate the resolution of high NPLs using a mix of policy measures, such as:
• Asset quality reviews, to identify loans that are nonperforming and need restructuring
• Separating good and bad assets of banks (so-called ‘good bank’-‘bad bank’ resolution). This makes the financial conditions of good banks more transparent, steadies their market access, and lets them focus on extending new lending. Bad banks, often structured as asset management companies, proceed to extracting value from bad assets

More details on NPL resolution methods are provided in Balgova et al. (2016), Beck (2017), Brei et al. (2020), and in ECB Financial Stability Reviews by Grodzicki et al. (2015) and Fell et al. (2016 and 2017).

Despite the economic benefits of NPL reduction and the variety of methods available, the data paint a sobering picture of historic NPL resolution. While some countries resolve NPLs rapidly, a third of countries are saddled with NPLs for over seven years after a crisis. The NPL reduction outcomes after the Global Crisis are direr still: two-thirds of the countries that experienced high NPLs could not resolve those within seven years of the crisis (Figure 2). Strikingly, this also implies that while advanced economies tend to have lower post-crisis NPLs, they also take longer on average to resolve.

Note: Reproduced from Ari, Chen, and Ratnovski (2020), Figure 6. The left panel shows the number of countries that resolved NPLs (with NPL ratios to under 7%) in each year after the crisis. The right panel compares the number of counties that resolved and don’t resolve NPLs with 7 years. The colours distinguish the crisis waves and types.

In the paper, we use the ‘local projections’ method to assess the link between NPL resolution and post-crisis output dynamics, while controlling for their co-dependence. The results underscore that NPL resolution is critical for economic recovery. High and unresolved NPLs are associated with deeper recessions and slower recoveries. Six years after a banking crisis, output in countries that experience high NPLs is 6.5 percentage points lower in countries that don’t. Of the countries that have high NPLs, output in countries that do not resolve NPLs are more than ten percentage points lower than in countries that do (Figure 3).

b) The difference in GDP after the crisis between the countries that experience high NPLs (within 7 years) compared to those that don’t

Note: Reproduced from Ari, Chen, and Ratnovski (2020), Figure 6. The charts report the differences in output paths (expressed as percent of deviation from pre-crisis output between countries that, following a banking crisis, experience NPLs exceeding 7% compared to those that have NPLs under 7% (left panel), between countries that, having experienced NPLs exceeding 7%, manage to resolve them compared to those that do not (right panel).

NPL resolution in Europe after the 2008-2012 crisis

Further, we use a model selection approach to assess which pre-crisis indicators predict the dynamics of NPLs in banking crises. We document that peak NPLs are higher in countries with lower GDP per capita, after a credit boom, under fixed exchange rates, with less profitable banks, or banks with more fragile corporate balance sheets. NPL resolution is more protracted in similar circumstances, as well as in countries with high public debt and more sophisticated banking sectors. Interestingly, these high-level indicators have good predictive power (the average (pseudo) adjusted R-squared across the specifications is 0.24).

These results shed light on the factors behind the high, and persistent, NPLs in some European countries after the 2008-2012 crisis. In the paper, we compare actual NPL dynamics in seven European countries (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Hungary, and Slovenia) with what could have been anticipated based on historical patterns. It turns out that high NPL levels in Europe in 2010s were hard to anticipate: the crisis was extraordinarily severe for advanced economies. By contrast, protracted NPL resolution was in line with historical patterns: it is common for crises that follow a credit boom (Figure 4). Indeed, the long-term negative consequences of credit booms are well-documented in the literature (Caballero et al. 2008). They are related to the difficulties in resolving the debt of non-viable ‘zombie’ firms and households that are ‘underwater’ on their housing assets.

Note: Reproduced from Ari, Chen, and Ratnovski (2020), Figure 7. The chart shows NPL metrics: actual (in green) and out-of-sample predicted (in blue), on average for a sample of European countries affected by the 2008-2012 crisis. The metrics of NPLs are: peak NPLs as percent of total loans (left panel) and the duration of NPL resolution in years (right panel).

What does this mean for NPL resolution after COVID-19?

Even though our paper studies NPLs in the context of banking crises, and therefore cannot be mapped perfectly to the COVID-19 events, it provides valuable insights into impending NPL challenges. Our results highlight forces that can make NPL resolution after the COVID-19 events different from the situation after the 2008-2012 crisis. Some forces are enabling of NPL resolution. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic is not a credit boom-induced crisis. If the economic downturn proves temporary, many post-COVID-19 NPLs may relate to viable illiquid firms, rather than unviable zombie firms. European banks have entered the COVID-19 pandemic with (on average) higher capital ratios compared to the 2008 crisis. The recently introduced IFRS-9 accounting standards may induce faster NPL recognition, and hence resolution, thanks to their forward-looking nature (although a ‘too fast’ NPL recognition may also constrain bank lending during downturns). Other forces point to challenges in NPL resolution. Compared to 2008, most European countries have substantially higher public debt, less profitable banks, and often weaker corporate sector conditions (the factors that historically have complicated NPL resolution). Moreover, if the economic recovery from the pandemic is slow and protracted, credit losses from corporate distress will rise and could overwhelm banks, further complicating NPL resolution.

Given the importance of NPL reduction for economic recovery, and many countries’ historical difficulties in implementing effective NPL-related interventions, designing effective NPL resolution policies for the post-COVID-19 world is a key forward-looking financial policy issue for Europe today.

Editors’ note: This column first appeared as a Research "|0
2020-05-30|"As debates about the future of the World Health Organization rage on, the Covid-19 pandemic is a reminder of the vital importance of global public health institutions. This column considers what principles should guide WHO’s missions and tools to deal with pandemics, which are distinguished from other health risks by their high contagion, extreme potential outcomes in terms of mortality risk, and the ‘weak-link’ aspect of global collective action. It argues that reforms should centre around having a narrower mission – Global Response to Infectious Diseases, or GRID – and creating better incentives to prevent contagions from spreading globally using stronger legal and financial tools.

The World Health Assembly, the annual decision-making meeting of the World Health Organization (WHO), met in May over videoconference. The squabbling over the institution’s funding and political independence that erupted between the US and China highlighted the embattled state of the global public health institution facing its biggest ever challenge – the Covid-19 pandemic.

WHO’s initial response has been heavily criticised, and there is a real risk that without reforms, it will wither into irrelevance (e.g. Buranyi 2020). Yet, the pandemic has also vividly demonstrated why WHO is needed, given the critical role that detecting, tracing, and containing contagion play in saving lives across the globe.

Economists have been active in helping us think about the appropriate policy responses to mitigate economic damage from the global pandemic, focusing on fiscal and monetary policies, financial regulation, social insurance, industry, and trade (Baldwin and Weber di Mauro 2020).

Here, we take a longer-term view and use insights from public economics and the economics of organisations to think about changes to WHO’s mission and tools that would enable it to deal more effectively with outbreaks of infectious disease that threaten to become pandemics.

The emerging literature on bureaucracies and public organisations that focuses on incentive and organisation design issues in the context of the provision of public goods offers some particularly relevant lessons ( Dewatripont et al. 1999, Besley and Ghatak 2018). It suggests that diffuse missions, noisy output measures, and task multiplicity make them appear less effective than their private sector counterparts even in the best of times, and potentially disastrous in times of crisis. No wonder, then, that WHO looks weak now, as it did when Ebola struck (Wenham 2017).

Three features distinguish this pandemic from other health risks:
• First, as with all infectious diseases, an individual’s health depends not only on their own behaviour but on the behaviour of others – that is, there is a large externality.
• Second, the virus’ contagiousness and capacity to travel means that all are vulnerable if one government (the weakest link) mismanages the crisis: China’s initial handling of the outbreak was very much the ‘O-ring’ of global public health (Kremer 1993).
• Third, the potential threat to lives and livelihoods is huge, immediate, and visible, making the case for concerted action easier than for other global risks, such as climate change.

These features require swift and sustained international coordination both to respond to this pandemic and to prevent future ones. They also imply that the absence of global coordination might lead governments to opt for isolationism. Closing borders so that foreigners can’t bring disease in may seem like a reasonable short-term response, but it will have enormous human and economic costs over a longer period (e.g. Trilling 2020 on the situation of refugees, Freund 2020 on the costs of shortening global value chains).

There is another solution. The world has already experienced a ‘trial-run’ for coping with major global risks: airline security in response to 9/11. Like the current pandemic, terrorism posed a grave threat and showed that the international community is only as strong as its weakest member. Significant progress was made in countering this threat by establishing universal air-travel security standards and monitoring their enforcement.

To reinvent itself to counter the threat of pandemics effectively, WHO needs three things.

First, a narrower focus. A disease will have to meet three criteria for WHO intervention: large global externalities, high mortality risk, and a ‘weak-link’ aspect to government action. Eradicating malaria, for example, is an extremely worthwhile goal, but the disease does not travel much internationally, making direct intervention (as opposed to financial support of the type given by the Global Fund) by an international institution unnecessary.

Following the model of recent global public health funds with a narrow focus (Sridhar and Woods 2013), WHO must redefine its core mission around the global response to infectious diseases – let us call this hypothetical division ‘GRID’.

Other aspects of public health could be left to WHO’s research and advisory departments. This means a sharp departure from its current agenda, which covers many aspects of global health, from mental wellbeing to obesity, with no clear prioritisation. WHO should focus on aspects of public health for which the externalities are truly global, the potential risks high, and the interdependence in outcomes across countries so strong that isolated national responses won’t suffice.

The second thing WHO needs is capacity – beyond that granted by the International Health Regulations (Gostin et al. 2015) – to sanction countries that do not follow its rules. The global community gave the WTO powers to impose economic sanctions on its member states. Avoiding another pandemic is at least as worthy a goal as increasing global trade and should be backed with similar sanctioning power.

Particular care must be paid to how sanctions are designed. Sanctioning a state in which a pandemic starts may sound like a good idea, but is not credible in practice. When such a disaster strikes, GRID’s mission would require it to offer the afflicted country support. This means that GRID cannot sanction countries based on outcomes but on the steps taken to abide by its recommendations.

Third, WHO needs a budget adequate to the task. WHO’s current annual budget, roughly $2 billion, is not much higher than the budget of the main hospital in its host city, Geneva. Determining the exact amounts needed is best left to public health specialists and epidemiologists, but the current budget is clearly and grossly inadequate.

Consider, for example, what it would cost to prevent the international spread of a highly contagious disease through air travel. Taking the estimated cost of a Covid-19 test ($10 according to Romer 2020) and the number of air passengers in 2018 (4.2 billion) as a benchmark, $42 billion would be needed for testing international travellers alone. Airlines may of course be willing to foot some of the bill for these tests if their survival is at stake (and we expect the number of air passengers to fall in the short run). But even half that number is ten times WHO’s current budget.

How would GRID raise money? One option would levy ‘user-fees’ on those benefitting the most from the global movement of people, something that GRID would protect. Multinational corporations top that list. Torslov et al. (2020) estimate that they made $1.7 trillion in profits from their international activities in 2015, a non-trivial share of which is booked in tax havens and therefore subject to little taxation. A 5% tax on these international profits alone would generate $85 billion.

International air passengers and airlines could also be asked to chip in, if only to pay for the testing infrastructure in airports. While clearly ambitious, these proposals are not without real-world precedent. UNITAID, a global health fund, is already partially funded by a tax on international air travel levied by several countries.

Giving GRID its own sources of funding would free it from relying on voluntary contributions by individual countries and shield it from the undue political influence of powerful countries (e.g. Huang 2020). These new sources of funding would need to raise enough funds to finance GRID’s recurring prevention, monitoring, and research expenditures. In addition, GRID must be given the right to borrow to mobilise funds quickly when a global public health emergency occurs.

If we neglect the writing on the wall about WHO, the uncoordinated responses of national governments will hurt ordinary citizens across the globe, especially the poorest and most vulnerable. The virus does not respect borders or walls; our response must transcend them as well.

2020-05-30|"Cities rise and fall, but the city has a way of confounding its would-be obituarists. Futurists thought digital communications would kill off urban living. The growth of the suburbs threatened to hollow out the centre.

The 9/11 attacks were presumed by many to mark the end of the era of the skyscraper. For centuries, war, pollution, violence and plague have reminded us that density makes us vulnerable, but still the majority of us – 55 per cent of the world’s population, by the United Nations’ latest count – choose to live this way. Indeed, cities often emerge stronger from their moments of greatest peril. The 1918 influenza pandemic killed millions of Europeans, but within a few years Paris and Berlin were booming again.

That resilience tells us the modern city will survive the Covid-19 pandemic. But it could yet be transformed by the crisis.

This has been a largely metropolitan trauma. Wherever the virus has taken hold, the epicentres – Wuhan, Madrid, New York, London – are big cities where people live in close quarters, commute on cramped trains, pray in big congregations and drink in crowds. What gave cities their life also helped take it away. One of the recurring visual motifs of the past three months has been the haunting image of the abandoned city, with its streets deserted, shops boarded up and office blocks lying empty.

Some of those closures will be permanent, because if and when the health crisis comes to an end – as it will if the virus burns itself out, immunity levels reach critical mass or a treatment or vaccine become available – another, economic, crisis will continue.

Many shops and restaurants will not make it out the other side. Cultural life will be reeling from the shock of the lockdown; Unesco, the United Nations cultural agency, has warned that the pandemic may permanently close one in eight of the world’s museums.

Social distancing will result in longer queues, Spartan pubs and a generally more monochrome version of urban life. And with the enforced shift towards remote working having opened people’s eyes to an alternative routine, many employers (alert to the savings they can make by reducing their office space) and workers (tired of high housing costs and long commutes) may come to the same conclusion: that the office itself is obsolete. Prohibitive living costs were already resulting in population decline in some western cities. This would accelerate it.

Cities have always flourished because people are drawn to the possibilities they offer: jobs, trade, exchange of ideas. That constant inward flow is what sustains and renews them. If the looming recession is accompanied by a nativist, protectionist turn, and that results in stricter migration policies, it would prolong the downturn and speed up population decline in many cities. Philadelphia, for example, would have shrunk without immigration over the past five years.

But unless pandemics become the new normal – which as the urban economist Edward Glaeser of Harvard University has noted would result in tens of millions of urban service jobs disappearing and large-scale social dislocation – then the current crisis should allow for a broader rethink about how cities are designed, maintained and lived in. Just as the cholera outbreaks of the 1830s resulted in better sanitation in London and the tuberculosis epidemic in New York in the early 20th century led to better housing regulations and public transport, the current crisis could turn out to be an important inflection point. Some cities have already begun to reorganise themselves by creating more room for pedestrians and cyclists, improving homeless accommodation and taking steps to free up tourist housing for residents. Many of these are nominally stopgap measures, but it will be difficult to reverse them.

But the new momentum behind the push for urban cycling infrastructure and an expansion of public spaces is only a start. A more thorough rethink would consider how to improve sustainability, food security and living standards. It would note how, in many cities, the poor and ethnic minorities have been particularly vulnerable, and ask what that has to do with housing conditions and economic geography. It would look at ways of easing pollution and commuting times by making city life more compact. (In Paris, mayor Anne Hidalgo talks of creating the “quarter-hour city”, where most daily needs are withing a 15-minute walk, cycle or public transport journey.) It would think about ways to renew artistic life and rejuvenate the creative scenes that have been endangered by soaring rents.

The city is where the future happens first. Its transitory, unforgiving, fleeting nature, its constant capacity for reinvention, is what makes it so intoxicating. If any good can come of the agony of Covid-19, it is that the city, the epicentre of the epidemic, can be the laboratory for a new wave of experiments into better living."|0

2020-05-30|"Apart from the pregnant women, there were some elderly passengers, young children and a seriously ill patient, authorities said.

The Vietnam Airlines flight VN579, organized specially to repatriate Vietnamese citizens, landed at the Da Nang International Airport at 4:40 p.m.

All passengers had undergone medical checks before boarding and wore face masks throughout the flight. They submitted health declarations and were transferred to quarantine facilities in the central province of Quang Nam on arrival. Their samples have been taken for testing.

According to Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center, it was the first repatriation of Vietnamese from Taiwan since Vietnam suspended all international flights on March 22.

One of the repatriated passengers is suffering from pancreatic cancer. The passenger will be transferred to a local hospital for isolation and cancer treatment, said Tran Van Kiem, director of Quang Nam Center for Disease Control.

Nguyen Duc Hoang, deputy director of Thang Binh District’s medical center, said some of the 243 pregnant women on the flight were near their due dates. Therefore, the center has prepared emergency ambulances and set up an obstetrics emergency team in case they give birth in the quarantine area.

On the way to Taiwan, the flight carried a number of Taiwanese citizens and Vietnamese with Taiwan residency who had been stranded in Vietnam.

In the last few months, several special flights have repatriated thousands of Vietnamese from several countries including Canada, France, Japan, Russia, the UAE and the U.S., and other Southeast Asian countries. Passengers paid their own fares.

Vietnam has gone 43 days without community transmission of Covid-19. Of the 328 infections recorded so far, 49 are active, the rest having recovered. There has been no death recorded so far.

Taiwan has confirmed 442 infection cases and reported seven deaths."|1

2020-05-30|"Dovere: You think you’re going to have to fire police officers and firefighters in Dayton if you don’t get more federal money?

Whaley: Absolutely. Sixty percent of the budget is police and fire. Ohio is a municipal-income state. Seventy percent of the budget of Dayton comes from earnings tax, so if people aren’t working, you don’t have a budget. It immediately falls out, I think in July or August, after the unemployment runs out.

And all the other cities in Ohio are in the same boat. Anywhere from 15 to 25 percent is where the Ohio mayors are thinking the trouble will be. And when 60 percent of the budget is police and fire, you just can’t get to an 18 percent cut without doing something about police and fire. And we’ve already cut enormously during the Great Recession and before.

Dovere: If you’re looking already at a spike in homicides and overdoses, and you’re going to look forward to likely cuts to police and fire, what does that mean for the way a city functions?

Whaley: Well, I just don’t think it will function well. And it’s egregious, frankly. You’ll bail out airlines. You’ll bail out every other thing known to man, but not police or fire? Are you serious?

Dovere: And it’s not like everything is, like, calm otherwise. We’re seeing what is happening in Minneapolis with George Floyd, who was killed, and the violence that has erupted after that. One of the things that I have been struck by over the course of the three months of this lockdown is that the social fabric has held as much as it has. Does that worry you?

Whaley: If any mayor tells you they don’t worry about what’s happening in Minneapolis happening in their city, they’re really naive or they’re not telling you the truth.

I remember when Freddie Gray happened in Baltimore, Mayor [Michael] Coleman was the mayor of Columbus and he was friends with Mayor [Stephanie] Rawlings-Blake. And so I called and said, “Have you checked in on her? How is she doing?” “Oh yeah, it’s very tough, Nan.” And he just said: “Because by the grace of God, we all go.”

I mean, the social fabric, you do a lot of work on it in your community. But there are things you just don’t control. And you have to recognize that too.

Dovere: It’s been one year since tornadoes hit Dayton. There was a mass shooting in August. You’ve spent so much of the last year in a consoler role, helping people get through these tragedies. We have seen a real lack of that on the national level. What do you think, given your experience, needs to be said and needs to be done as people continue to feel the hit of this, whether through a death or job loss.

Whaley: I don’t see a lot of empathy in the national dialogue at all right now. And I recognize there’s not a lot of women besides the speaker there. I have learned and appreciate the value of vulnerability and leading through being vulnerable. And that means to show that you’re human, to show that this is hard on you too, but to be resolved—and honestly resolved—that you’re going to get through it.

I long for leadership that shows some empathy. And I long for leadership that, even if I don’t agree with it, I can respect. And that’s why I do appreciate Governor [Mike] DeWine. We do not agree. Even through the pandemic, I have disagreed with him. But I respect him. And I learned from the shooting that he does have empathy. And I long for that kind of leadership in the federal government. That’s, I think, that’s what I miss the most."|0

3 Things to Consider When Purchasing a Security System

Joe Anderson

Founder

Reflex Protect

""Before purchasing a security system: 1) Do your research. Ask family, friends and coworkers what they use and like, and read reviews. In addition, many police crime-prevention units and fire departments have alarm specialists who you can connect with for advice. 2) It's very important to go with a reputable company. When an alarm sounds, you want to be completely assured that your system is going to function as it should. 3) Remember, this is a long-term investment for your home. You don't need to break the bank, but you also don't want to go with bottom of the barrel. At the end of the day, a system that provides daily peace of mind and is a deterrent to would-be criminals is the goal.""

In 1993, on a Thursday just before 3 p.m., Joe Anderson was in a deposition when a gunman entered his former law firm Pettit & Martin in San Francisco. That day, nine of Joe's friends and colleagues lost their lives. Joe was shocked, in a state of disbelief. In the following years, Columbine, Sandy Hook, and The Pulse nightclub shootings all occurred, and all Joe could think was ""How can we stop this from ever happening again?"" So, when his friend, co-founder and inventor Steve came to him with the idea for the Reflex Protect® product, he thought, ""I wish this had been in the receptionist's hands 25 years earlier; it might have changed everything.""

Contact all of your providers and ask if they can work with you: mortgage, rent, insurance, car payments, etc. 5) Are there expenses you can eliminate? Cable, recurring subscriptions, gas, etc. Now is the time to dig deep and clearly define needs versus wants so you can get lean.""

2020-05-29|NEW DELHI: India reported the highest single-day rise in Covid-19 cases as well as deaths, with over 7,700 new infections detected and 270 fatalities related to the virus reported on Friday. With this, the country’s Covid-19 count has risen to nearly 1.69 lakh cases while the death toll is close to 5,000 at 4,978.The day also saw a big leap in the number of coronavirus patients who have recovered from the infection, with Maharashtra reporting as many as 8,381 discharges, taking the total count to over 82,000 from 70,900 on Thursday.The huge spike in deaths — the previous highest was 199 reported on May 5 — was partly due to the Delhi government reporting 82 deaths on Friday, of which 69 were reported to have taken place during the course of the month.As many as 7,713 new infections were reported on Friday, a big jump from the previous high of 6,926, reported just a day earlier. On six of the last nine days, the daily count of cases has touched a new peak, indicating a surge in cases in the country. India’s total coronavirus count stands at 1,68,780.While Maharashtra again reported by far the country’s highest number of new cases, at least seven sta5tes recorded ther biggest jump in infections in a single day — Delhi (1,106 cases), Tamil Nadu (874), Karnataka (248), Haryana (217), Uttarakhand (216), Telangana (169) and Jharkhand (45).In several other states, the count of fresh cases remained high. Rajasthan reported 298 infections, Bengal 277, Uttar Pradesh 275, J&K 128, Assam 144 and Chhattisgarh 51, giving an overall picture of cases on the rise in many parts of the country. New cases were reported from 25 states/Union territories on Friday.|0
2020-05-29|"Going stir-crazy in quarantine? You’re not alone. Celebrities are cooped up in their homes across the country just like the rest of us. As we collectively navigate this uncharted territory, USA TODAY presents Quarantine Diaries, which give readers a peek into how our favorite stars are spending their time at home.

Today's diarist is comedian Kathy Griffin, who made a cameo in Netflix's ""You"" in January and released her documentary, ""Kathy Griffin: A Hell of a Story,"" last summer about the aftermath of her infamous Donald Trump photo scandal. Griffin, 59, made headlines in March after her trip to the emergency room, during which she was unable to get a coronavirus test despite ""unbearably painful symptoms."" She has since recovered and recently tested negative.

Griffin stirred up fresh controversy Tuesday, tweeting that Trump should be injected with a ""syringe with nothing but air inside it,"" which can be lethal. She has since shared her feelings following the death of George Floyd.

Here's what a day of Griffin's quarantine is like in California, where she's quarantining with husband Randy Bick, two employees and the couple's four dogs: Olivia Benson, Elliot Stabler, and new puppies Maggie and Mary (named after her mother, Maggie Mary Griffin, who died in March at 99). – As told to Hannah Yasharoff

4 a.m. My husband and I are getting up about twice in the night with the dogs. They're not 100% potty trained, so we still get up to take them out. But the dogs have been really helpful and therapeutic. I want to encourage people to foster, even for just a few months. It's going to help you maybe more than the animal.

9:30 a.m. When I wake up for real, Business Lady Kathy is always working, through COVID or not. This morning I had a conference call with two of my lawyers and my CPA. I'm super hands-on with my finances. In this era, I'm kind of going through and saying ""Do I really need this? Can I stop doing this?""

10 a.m. I make an old-school smoothie – not from the box or anything. It's just fresh blueberries, bananas, peanut butter, Yakult, strawberries. Sometimes we'll throw greens in there.

On keeping in touch with friends:Sia and I make these one-minute videos for each other almost every day and we send them to each other. Some of them are ""How are you feeling today?"" and some are just silly.

On how her Trump scandal prepared her for quarantine: I kind of feel like I lost my old life twice. It's almost three years ago to the day of the Trump photo when a big part of my ""old"" life ended with friends and work opportunities. And now with COVID, everybody is dealing with, ""Oh gosh, I actually kind of had an old life, this is a sort of purgatory."" Hopefully, we get over the edge to something better.

Lunch: I will admit, we have nothing close to a meal schedule around here. People kind of grab their own thing when they feel like it. But if we sit together, we actually try to eat six feet apart.

I have a new diet plan that I am not recommending. You know how a lot of people diet and they go six days on, and one cheat day? I have decided, based on no data, that I'm going to do day on/day off. So one day, it's a green drink, it's a vegan meal. Then the next day I might eat an entire cake. But the point is I'm going to get back to the green drink the next day.

On writing political jokes right now: Every day, there's obviously a deluge of scary news, but then there's also one (headline) where I'm like, ""I can spin that."" A crazy press conference with Jared Kushner, for example. I don't want people to think I'm anti-America – I love America. Let the newsmakers say he's not qualified to have that job. But what I can say is that every time he walks out on camera, he honestly looks like he just left a spa. He looks like he gets five facials a day. For me, this is probably the build-up to my next stand-up special.

On finding ways to help: Taking action is something that I love to do. My assistant did a great job of tracking down a catering company that has experience bringing meals to hospitals. I was proud of being able to help there. I sent pizzas to urgent care – I had my assistant say they could have anything they wanted to eat, and they were like, ""pizzas."" I try to share feel-good things on social media and then make fun of myself in some way.

On staying active: I am fortunate enough to have a large backyard and I'm still too scared to even go out on my street in a mask to walk around. I put on my iPod and I have the corniest music – my friends always tease me about it. They're like, ""Did your 14-year-old niece make this for you?"" It's Backstreet Boys, Celine Dion, Josh Groban, Lady Gaga, Liza Minnelli. So there's a big square in my yard and I walk around it for an hour.

7:30 p.m. I can't boil water, I must confess. We have a lot of discussions about if it's safe to do curbside pickup. Let's say we want a pizza. I say only restaurants that are willing to come out and put the food in the trunk of the car. That's how risk-averse I'm trying to be.

What I'm watching: ""90 Day Fiance."" And I have never in my life watched more ""Dateline"" and ""Snapped."" This quarantine has turned me into someone who loves everything ""As Seen on TV."" You know those commercials? I thought I wasn't going to be buying these things until I was 90, but I'm super excited about my grabber.

10 p.m. One member of our little quarantine team made homemade chocolate marshmallow banana bread. And then he made homemade hot fudge. So I have to report a crime: I think someone intruded into my home last night and accidentally put together, in a really large bowl, a microwaved large slice of that banana bread, quite a bit of vanilla ice cream – you know burglars, they take everything – and then this burglar also took the time to heat the hot fudge and put that on top of everything. In the old world, I might have done that once or twice a month, but like everyone, now I have days where I'm like, ""Everything's going to be great!"" and other days where I'm like, ""Screw it, let's have some hot fudge.""

11 p.m. We'll try to go to bed early, which for me is around 11, but sometimes we'll just stay up if we're really engrossed in a show. We just got through Season 2 of ""The Crown,"" and it's one of those things where you're like, ""Want to watch one more?""

How I'm feeling: I hope people take this much more seriously. I'm very frightened by the misinformation. This is an opportunity for some of us to undo some of our mistakes. I don't think my Trump photo was a mistake and I'm actually quite proud of it, but I'm hoping this will get us out of some of our bubbles.

I do have a little optimism that after all this, we might be a little more mindful and thoughtful. I, of course, will still be spouting vulgarity and things like that. But only if you're laughing."|0
2020-05-31|"The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a crisis in the UK universities

The COVID-19 pandemic is causing serious financial problems for UK universities. This column identifies the over-reliance on Chinese students for fee income as the main cause of the impact and considers what steps the government might take to support universities through this crisis.

The COVID-19 pandemic is having widespread effects on inequality (Overman 2020, Furceri et al. 2020) and education. Its effects on the UK’s higher education (HE) system could also be dramatic (see Dolton 2020). In this column, I suggest that the present financial problems of universities are rooted in their growing reliance of UK universities on the huge growth in overseas students coming to the UK for higher education. This growth has been more or less exclusively from China. Figure 1 shows how the numbers of new students arriving in the UK over the years 2006 to 2019 has changed. The numbers coming from nearly all countries other than China has remained approximately constant. But the numbers coming from China have risen from 25,000 in 2006 to approaching 90,000 by 2019. This over-reliance on recruiting Chinese students has meant that the UK HE system is vulnerable to any change in policy from the Chinese government or an exogenous event like COVID-19.

Figure 2 charts how the university funding system has changed over the last 10 years. In 2010 over half of the funding came from central government. Now only approximately 25% of funding comes from central government. The remainder comes directly from student fee income. The reality is that the present UK HE funding regime involves a large-scale underinvestment in research and an element of cross subsidisation of fee income to fund research.

Source: Author’s calculations based on data from House of Commons Briefing Paper 7393.

Another major headache for UK university finances has been the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) and its associated problems. This is the largest private sector pension scheme in the UK, with assets of over £68 billion. Recent calculations indicate that the scheme has a valuation shortfall of between £6.6 billion (Reeve 2019) and £17.5 billion (Borej 2017). This will result in rising university employer contributions to the scheme, exacerbating their financial problems.

Will the overseas students come to the UK to study next academic year?

How bad are the implications of COVID-19 for the short-term and long-term future of the UK higher education system? Should universities plan on opening in September, or do they move their operations online? The truth of the matter is that we do not presently know the exact nature of the implications of COVID-19 for future student demand. Some universities are planning for worst-case scenarios that could involve losing up to 75% of their overseas students and a drop of 20% of home students attending university this September, potentially leading to severe financial trouble. In this worst-case scenario, it has been suggested that all universities except Oxford and Cambridge could become insolvent.

In a survey conducted by the British Council (2020), it was suggested that up to 50% of postgraduate students who were planning to come to the UK are planning to defer and around 20% are likely to change where they go as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If the demand for UK university education from countries like China, India, and many of the African countries proves to be resilient, then these measures may not be necessary. Clearly there will be many overseas students who choose not to come to the UK in September 2020. But does this mean that they will never come? Surely a sizeable fraction of this demand will still be in place in September 2021 and many students will simply defer for a year. This logic may justify the government viewing the impending financial crisis of UK HE as a short run liquidity crisis.

What measures can universities take in the short run?

The main issue facing universities right now is to prevent themselves from going broke in the short run and planning for the opening of campuses in September. But what will happen if universities are not allowed to open again in September? Or indeed what happens if there is a second or subsequent wave of the pandemic? Universities should have contingency plans for these eventualities. Those without reserves or endowments will have little alternative but to make representations to central government for special financial help. But it has already been signalled that this will come at the price of considerable structural reforms.

Faced with these large expected losses in income, many universities in the UK are already implementing, or planning to implement, hiring freezes, redundancies, termination of short-term contracts, dropping courses and even whole degree programmes, and closing departments. Talk of mergers of neighbouring universities have been rumoured – although the evidence on the efficiencies to be gained is weak (Johnes 2013). Senior management at some universities has taken a voluntary pay cut and proposed that professorial staff follow suit. These measures have large adverse implications for employment in the university sector, with some estimates suggesting up to 300,000 job losses (London Economics 2020).

The calculations of risk liability based on the financial position of different universities suggest that between 30 to 50 of them could be in immediate danger of insolvency (London Economics 2020, Brackley 2020). Brackley (2020) has calculated the universities that are at most risk of financial failure, with an ‘at risk score’ that takes into account the current financial position of the university on debts and loans and their exposure to the loss of fee income from overseas students. The estimated cash loss as a fraction of total income and the ordering of the ‘at risk score’ are presented in Figure 3. Cluster 1 includes Oxford and Cambridge, cluster 2 consists of the traditional universities in the Russell Group, cluster 3 consists of the other pre-1992 universities, and cluster 4 captures the remainder. It shows that two of the universities with the lowest risk score, the green dots of Oxford and Cambridge, are at the extreme right end of the at-risk ordering. Figure 3 also shows that the estimated cash loss varies across universities from 0-20%. The universities at most risk of financial failure (the vertical axis in the figure) come from Cluster 3 and 4 but there are some potential casualties from the Cluster 2 as well. So, it is possible that there could be some universities with a considerable research reputation in severe financial difficulty as a result of this pandemic.

What can or should the government be doing to help?

Can a government in office be seen to allow various universities to close? Politically this could result in quite a high popularity hit. This would be especially true if the universities in question were predominantly in the North of England, Scotland and Wales. Arguably, it is expensive to merge and restructure a university with a neighbour and there is relatively little evidence in favour of potential economies of scale (Payne 2008). But this should not prevent universities from seriously considering this option in an attempt to rationalise their provision and economise on costs. Another pertinent point to consider is whether neighbouring universities should be forced to merge by the government.

In response to the potential loss of overseas student fee income, UUK (2020) asked the government for a £2.2 billion boost to short run research funding. What the government decided to do instead was increase research funding by only £100 millio and allow an advance on undergraduate fee income from the Student Loans company to the tune of £2.6 billion. This represents a loan of around 10% of fee income to universities. While this loan will be a short-run lifeline for some universities, it only stores up future funding problems as these loans will inflate future financial obligations. We do not presently know how this loan will be released to universities or whether it will be in direct proportion to each university’s existing level of potential fee shortfall. The latest word from the HM Treasury is that a potential financial handout to any institution in financial trouble could be possible in exchange for restructuring reforms.

2020-05-31|"Earlier this month, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) reported first-quarter 2020 results. (3D Systems' results here and Stratasys' here). We're going to compare the two 3D printing companies' results metric for metric.

Keep in mind that qualitative factors can be just as meaningful as quantitative ones and we're looking at just one quarter. Even with these caveats, however, the findings from this exercise should help you make investing decisions in the 3D printing space.

Both companies experienced fairly sizable year-over-year sales declines. These declines were in the same ballpark percentage-wise, so this category is a draw.

Both companies were already struggling to grow revenue before the COVID-19 pandemic due largely to a weak global macroeconomic industrial environment. 3D Systems was also hurt by having to pause shipments of its factory metals printing solution due to quality issues. (Shipments resumed in April.)

The pandemic hurt both companies' results, with the brunt of the impact in March. The impact was due largely to lower demand from customers in their target verticals, particularly those in the aerospace and auto industries. 3D Systems management also said that the company experienced supply chain interruptions.

Both companies were unprofitable from a GAAP basis. 3D Systems is the winner (or the ""lesser loser,"" more accurately) here because its results improved relative to the year-ago period, while Stratasys' got considerably worse.

3D Systems gets this win, too. Its non-GAAP (adjusted) loss per share narrowed from the year-ago period. Stratasys' result considerably worsened, flipping to negative, from positive.

Stratasys is the clear winner here. Its adjusted gross margin was 5.7 percentage points higher than 3D Systems'.

Stratasys is also the winner if we consider GAAP gross margin. Its result for this metric was 45%, versus 3D Systems' 42.4%.

A higher gross margin relative to a competitor with a quite similar business can reflect stronger pricing power.

Stratasys generated cash from operations in the quarter, while 3D Systems ate into its cash to run its operations.

In addition, Stratasys had about twice as much cash on hand as its competitor at the end of the period. Its stronger balance sheet gives it the upper hand in acquisitions and the ability to better withstand tough times.

Stratasys spent more money -- both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of revenue -- on R&D than did 3D Systems.

R&D spending can be viewed as an investment to fuel growth. It's critical for companies in the technology space to continue to innovate.

There was no runaway winner, but Stratasys did edge out 3D Systems.

Keep in mind the two caveats mentioned at the top of this article: qualitative factors can be as important as quantitative ones, and we only considered one quarter's results."|1

Tesco: Panic in the Aisles

 Sunday, Channel 5, 7.15pm

 When the coronavirus pandemic first began to take hold in March, Britain went into a panic-buying frenzy. Fiona Phillips reports on how supermarket chain Tesco coped with increased demand at its stores and how consumers’ shopping habits changed. As the British public filled their cupboards with more than £2 billion worth of extra groceries, Tesco doubled its share of the growing online market. However, with its supermarket shelves stripped bare and thousands of staff self-isolating or being off sick, company bosses faced an enormous logistical challenge.

It’s been tough on everyone living in lockdown, but for some it’s been unimaginably tough, and this documentary features four people for whom the Covid crisi has brought pain, sadness and a huge sense of loss. Each of them writes a letter to a loved one they are separated from. You might want to steel yourself for an emotional ride, as these letters spell out the prosaic reality of living through a pandemic that prevents them from holding their loved ones close to them.

Dubliner Billy Jenkins (87) writes to his beloved wife Aggie, who is in a nursing home diagnosed with dementia. Artist Domino Whisker writes to her dad and fellow artist Charlie, whose works are owned by stars such as Bono and Stephen Soderbergh, and who has won a Grammy for his video work with Bob Dylan. Charlie was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s, and Domino cared for him until he had to move into a nursing home.

Ornagh Lee, a fitness coach, writes to her friend Dee about the challenge of dealing with the pandemic while battling with mental-health issues. And Margaret Lynch, who turned 100 in April, and has six children, 19 grandchildren and 29 great-grandchildren, writes to her newest great-grandson Daniel, who was born the day after her birthday. She can’t hold him yet, but she can tell him all about her long life and all the great events she’s lived through, including this moment in history.

2020-05-31|"Revenge of the experts: Will COVID-19 renew or diminish trust in science?

It is argued that COVID-19 will reverse the ongoing trend of challenging the value of science and the integrity of scientists. This column shows that exposure to epidemics in one’s country of residence during the ‘impressionable years’ of ages 18 to 25 has no impact on confidence in science as an enterprise, but negatively affects views of the honesty and public-spiritedness of scientists.

COVID-19 will change everything. (For overviews of the implications, see Benassy-Quere et al. 2020 and Benassy-Quere and Weder di Mauro 2020.) One effect, it has been argued, will be to reverse the secular trend of challenging the value of scientific expertise. “The coronavirus crisis has put a spotlight on the importance of science in supporting our nation’s well being” (Shepherd 2020). At the same time, the pandemic has put on display certain leaders’ “longstanding practice of undermining scientific expertise for political purposes” (Friedman and Plumer 2020), conceivably with negative implications for how the public views science and scientists. All of which points to the question posed by Grove (2020): “Will the coronavirus renew public trust in science?”

A further question is whether any change in public opinion will mainly affect the views of the scientific endeavour or individual scientists. Does any positive or negative reassessment of the importance and validity of science apply to both the undertaking and those engaged in it? Or does the public continue to have confidence in science as a potential source of a vaccine while dismissing individual scientists who warn that the time needed to develop that vaccine may be lengthy?

In Aksoy et al. (2020), we analyse this issue using the 2018 Wellcome Global Monitor (WGM), which includes responses to questions about confidence in science and scientists from more than 70,000 individuals in 160 countries. The responses of interest are to questions asked of all WGM respondents: “In general, would you say you trust science a lot, some, not much or not at all?” and “How much do you trust scientists” to do their work honestly, with the intention of benefiting the public? The geographical dispersion of the responses is in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Share of respondents who trust science and scientists

Notes: Panel A illustrates the share of respondents who trust science a lot or some. Panel B illustrates the share of respondents who trust scientists a lot or some. Countries are grouped in quintiles.

We use data on all global epidemics since 1970 to identify respondents who experienced an epidemic outbreak in their country of residence during their formative years, the stage of the life course when value systems and opinions are durably formed. Krosnick and Alwin (1989) formalise this as the ‘impressionable years hypothesis’ – that core attitudes, beliefs, and values crystallise between the ages of 18 and 25. Spear (2000) links this to the literature in neurology describing neurochemical and anatomical differences between the adolescent and adult brain. Giuliano and Spilimbergo (2013) show, for example, that experiencing a recession between the ages of 18 and 25 has a powerful impact on political preferences and beliefs about the economy that persists over the life cycle.

To assess the effect of past exposure to an epidemic on an individual’s trust in science and scientists, we estimate models where the dependent variable is a dummy variable indicating whether or not the respondent has confidence in science or scientists.

To operationalise our treatment variable (Exposure to epidemic, 18-25) in the paper, we calculate for each individual the number of people affected by an epidemic as a share of the population, averaged over the eight years when the individual was in his or her formative years (18-25 years old), consistent with the ‘impressionable years hypothesis’. In addition, we control for observable individual characteristics (age, gender, educational attainment, marital status, religion, and urban/rural residence), labour market outcomes, and within-country income deciles), country, year and age fixed effects, and country-specific age trends.

We find that formative-year epidemic exposure has a consistently negative and significant effect on whether the respondent has confidence in scientists; believes that scientists working for private companies benefit the public; believes that scientists working for private companies are honest; and believes that scientists working for universities are honest. An individual with the highest exposure to epidemics (0.032, that is, the number of people affected by an epidemic as a share of the population in individual’s formative years) relative to individuals with no exposure has on average 11 percentage points (-3.454*0.032) less confidence in the honesty of scientists.

In contrast, when the dependent variable concerns science as an undertaking or endeavour (“Do you have confidence in science? Will science and technology help to improve life? Is studying diseases a part of science”), the coefficients in question are instead positive, but do not differ significantly from zero. Evidently, individuals who experience epidemics at first hand retain confidence in the positive potential of science as an endeavour. They continue to believe in the importance of disease-related scientific research. But they are less confident about the trustworthiness and public-spiritedness of the individuals involved in scientific endeavors.

Given that previous work points to science education as shaping views of science and scientists, we also estimate our main specification for two subsamples: respondents who learned about science at most at the primary school level versus respondents who learned about science at least at the secondary school level. The results suggest that our findings are driven by the sample of individuals with little or no science education. It seems that science education is at least partly able to offset the adverse impact of epidemic experience on individuals’ trust in scientists.

We examined a number of sensitivity analyses to verify the robustness of the results. Placebo tests address the possibility that what we are picking up is not the impact on the perceived trustworthiness and public-spiritedness of scientists engaged in health-related research specifically, but the impact on perceptions of individuals engaged in tasks related to healthcare and health outcomes more generally. In contrast to its significant negative impact on confidence in scientists, the results indicate no significant impact on confidence in doctors and nurses, in hospitals and health clinics, in NGO workers, or in traditional healers.

We also confirmed the persistence of the impact of epidemic exposure as individuals age over time. Despite the fact that the confidence intervals around our estimates widen in smaller subsamples of rolling age windows, we confirm that epidemic exposure between the ages of 18 and 25 continues to significantly influence public perceptions in scientists’ trustworthiness and public-spiritedness even as the respondents age over time.

Lastly, the effect is insignificant when individuals are exposed to epidemics in any period other than when they are between 18 and 25 years old. These results are strongly consistent with the formative-years hypothesis, implying that the current generation experiencing COVID-19 in their formative years may end up distrusting scientists for a long period of their lives.

COVID-19 promises to reshape every aspect of society, not excluding how science is perceived. But it is not clear whether the authority of science and scientists will be enhanced or diminished, or whether such changes will affect mainly science as an endeavor or scientists as individuals.

If past epidemics are a guide, the virus will not have an impact on the regard in which science as an undertaking is held. But it will reduce confidence in individual scientists, worsen perceptions of their honesty, and weaken the belief that their activities benefit the public. The strongest impact is likely to be felt by individuals in their ‘impressionable years’, whose beliefs are in the process of being durably formed.

Responding to these trends will not be straightforward. At a minimum, our findings suggest that scientists working on public health matters and others concerned with scientific communication should think harder about how to communicate trustworthiness and honesty and, specifically, about how the generation currently in their impressionable years (‘Generation Z’) perceives such attributes. In addition, our results suggest that scientific education will help.

2020-05-31|"POINTING TO where visitors will be required to step onto a disinfectant mat at the entrance, Mario De Simoni says: “We expect a lot of discipline.” Mr De Simoni is president of the Scuderie del Quirinale, a venue in Rome for big cultural events, which on June 2nd inaugurates the first major art exhibition to open since covid-19 shut galleries and museums around the world. A celebration of the Renaissance master Raphael, to coincide with the 500th anniversary of his death, the show aims to burnish the reputation of an artist once seen as greater even than Leonardo or Michelangelo. But it will also be a test of how art can be displayed in an era of social distancing.

Visitors will be admitted in groups of six every five minutes, and the aim will be to keep them two metres apart throughout. In Italy, the legally required separation is only one metre. But, says Mr De Simoni, since people will be moving around, a safety margin is advisable. The Duomo (cathedral) in Florence has opted for necklaces that flash and vibrate if the wearer gets too close to another visitor. But the Scuderie rejected them as unacceptably intrusive.

Instead, attendants will accompany, and supervise, the parties of six on their journeys through the show. As they arrive in each space, visitors will be expected to take up positions marked on the floor, and that is where difficulties could arise. Will a scholar wanting time to examine, say, the so-called Tempi Madonna and its cartoon—displayed together here for the first time—have to move on after a brief inspection? The attendants are going to need abundant tact.

Playfully entitled Raffaello 1520-1483, the exhibition begins with its subject’s early death at the age of 37 and ends with his earliest known work. The first exhibit is a replica of his tomb in the Pantheon. The last is a page containing an exquisite drawing the 14-year-old Raffaello Sanzio made of his hand, and what is probably a self-portrait.

The curators’ aim has been to show how Raphael generated his distinctive style by a process of absorption. “He was able to fuse influences from other painters in a way very few artists have managed to do,” says Eike Schmidt, the director of the Uffizi, a gallery in Florence, which contributed about a quarter of the works on display (and will open its own doors on June 3rd). Mr Schmidt loaned about a quarter of the works on display, including Raphael’s portrait of his papal patron, Leo X—a decision that prompted the resignation of the Uffizi’s entire scientific committee. Its members considered the painting too fragile to move.

Raphael’s artistic alchemy mingled the emotion in Leonardo’s exchanged glances, the athleticism of Michelangelo’s muscular nudes and the softness of Perugino’s Madonnas to create an oeuvre that, until late in the 19th century, was widely seen as greater than that of his High Renaissance contemporaries. It was only with the advent of, first, Impressionism and, subsequently, the 20th-century avant-gardes that Raphael’s mastery of representational technique began to be appreciated a tad less. This show, open until August 30th, demonstrates how that mastery still has the power to astound. Raphael was the Mozart of art, capable at the age of 22 or less of producing a work as mature and accomplished as his Young Woman with Unicorn.

Far fewer people will get to see this revealing exhibition than if the pandemic had not struck. Unless the Scuderie extends its hours (and that is under consideration), it will accommodate 800-900 visitors a day. The Scuderie’s Caravaggio show in 2010 clocked up almost 6,000.

That raises the question of how galleries and museums can survive financially on severely restricted numbers. The publicly owned Scuderie has large reserves, but Mr De Simoni admits others may respond with sharply increased entrance charges. In the covid-19 world, art, like air travel, could once more become a privilege of wealth."|2

2020-05-31|"Looks like we’re going to get a full dose of government this week, some good but mostly bad.

Seems another gate has gone up to block access to pretty darned good fishing holes.

This time it’s the Orange Grove area in Terrebonne Parish.

I spent a day in these canals years ago with a young Mike Iaconelli, who qualified for the Bassmaster Classic in New Orleans while he was an amateur angler. He worked his way up from 10th place that final day to finish his first Classic in fifth place. He returned to south Louisiana a handful of years later to win the then-$500,000 Classic champion’s prize money.

This vast network has swallowed up freshwater fishermen for years, and now they are denied access by a gate.

The Louisiana Sportsmen’s Coalition stays on top of such things, and its growing number of members are fighting to keep this area from adding miles to the list of coastal and near-coast waterways denied to anglers access.

The issue appears to be the rush to permit construction of the gates, a permit approved by Terrebonne Parish’s Mart Black, the director of the parish’s Office of Coastal Restoration and Preservation.

In an alert to members, the LASC indicated its research discovered the Army Corps of Engineers never received an application for a permit to build the gates.

Furthermore, Terrebonne Parish scheduled a public hearing in March, but the meeting was, according to the LASC, “...shut down due to COVID-19 social distancing.”

The LASC further stated Black said he approved gate construction permit after receiving no negative comments.

Heavy email and telephone traffic prompted Black's response: “I support your efforts to keep fishing free and open in Terrebonne Parish. Losing these areas due to gates is costing the parish money. A solution needs to be found.

“My charge deals with impacts to vegetated wetlands under federal and state legislation, not with gates on private property. All required public notice postings were followed for this permit. The long-term solution to this can only be found in Baton Rouge with the (state) Legislature. A law should be enacted which prohibits such gates but carefully and fairly balances the needs of the property owners and the public, the fishing community.""

A public meeting is set for 5 p.m. Tuesday at the Regional Military Museum, 1154 Barrow Street in Houma.

Lily Bergeron broke the ice Saturday when she became the first girl to place in the 10 years of Junior Southwest Bassmasters’ monthly tournament.

She won the 11-14 age group with a five-bass catch weighing 11.48 pounds, and had the group’s big bass, a 3.03-pounder.

Hanson Chaney came in with the heavy stringer, 14.36 pounds, to win the 15-18 age group, and Beau Smith won in the age 7-10 group with 10.49 pounds. All nine places were taken by youngsters bringing in five-bass limits.

Although they launched from the Amelia Landing, several boats worked through “no wake” zones to get into the Belle River area.

Club moderator Jim Breaux reported the top lures were spinnerbaits, crankbaits, topwater Whopper Ploppers, frogs, Sinkos, D-Bombs and crawfish imitations.
• Trusted False River reporter Sam Pernici told of the big-time catfish run on the oxbow, a catch of “...20-25 nice 13-15 inch catfish. Worms work the best, and the gnats seem to be slowing down.”
• Fishermen 15 years and younger can enter a 27th annual, and now virtual, Youth Fishing Rodeo set June 13-14 and sponsored by U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service on the Southeast Louisiana National Wildlife Refuges.

More info will come next Sunday. Youngsters will be able to fish anywhere in Louisiana, and you won’t have to register.

Menhaden — pogeys — will make a rare appearance on the Wildlife and Fisheries Commission’s agenda for its monthly meeting set for 9:30 a.m. Thursday at state Wildlife and Fisheries headquarters on Quail Drive in Baton Rouge.

Recreational fishermen and related organizations have become increasingly concerned about the millions of pounds of pogeys taken from the Atlantic for several years and, now, Gulf of Mexico waters. The fish provide forage for fish pursued by recreational anglers along with commercial species. Another concern is how many species like speckled trout, redfish and commercial species like black drum are snared in pogey nets.

Public comment likely will be held to a minimum during the return to a “live” commission meeting.

The LDWF issued this meeting advisory: “Due to the public health emergency guidelines established in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, only 25 members of the public will be allowed in the meeting room at one time. All members of the public will have to wear a mask to enter the building.”

To mitigate these rules, LWFC members agreed to ask the public to limit attendance inside the Joe Herring Room to only those agenda items of interest and to leave the room after that item has been heard to allow other members of the public to move into the room.
• A call by commission member and oyster industry representative Al Sunseri for a presentation on plans related to CARES Act funding for the state’s 2019 fisheries disaster declaration related to the opening of the Bonnet Carre Spillway and the unusually high Mississippi River.
• A report on the opening of the recreational red snapper season.
• An update on wildlife and fisheries bills in the State Legislature.

The meeting will have live audio and video streaming via Zoom with this registration: wlf-la.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_lxxnQcVyRoOZNlImQrY5Qg.

Unlike at the Zoom meeting in May, the public will not have the chance to comment on the webcast but can email public comment to Comments@wlf.la.gov. (The email must include the agenda item number in the subject of your email and must include name and address.)

U.S. Interior secretary David Bernhardt and his staff have proposed opening and/or expanding fishing and hunting opportunity on 97 national wildlife refuges and nine national fish Hatcheries. Eight of the NWRs will be open to these activities for the first time, and the move will open an additional 2.3 million acres of land and water and could bring the hunting locations up to 399 — 331 for fishing — if the proposal is enacted.

The full proposal is available on the federal website: regulations.gov. You will need the docket number: FWS-HQ-NWRS-2020-0013. There are directions to submit comments, which are due June 9.

And the winner is

How fitting is it amidst this pandemic that Lufkin, Texas nurse Scott Tomez won the B.A.S.S.-sponsored Fish With Scott Canterbury sweepstakes?

According to B.A.S.S., Tomez has spent most of the past two months working in the emergency room in a hometown hospital.

“I've never won anything like this before,” Tomez said. “After the way this year has been, winning was a huge blessing and a great surprise.”

He’ll accompany Canterbury, a national touring pro angler, on a bass fishing vacation valued at more than $52,000 to spend time on what Tomez called his “home lakes,” Sam Rayburn Reservoir in east Texas and Toledo Bend on the Louisiana-Texas border.

“(I) look forward to catching fish again,” Tomez said."|1

2020-05-31|"Protecting people now, helping the economy rebound later

The public health measures to ‘flatten the Covid-19 curve' will necessarily and appropriately impose large economic costs. This column, taken from a VoxEU eBook, identifies the constraints that policy faces during a pandemic – uncertainty, time, and capacity – and the implications of these constraints.

The coronavirus is a shock to the economy the likes of which none of us has ever seen. A hurricane hitting every place in the United States, Europe, and much of the rest of the world simultaneously. And hitting every day for weeks, months, or perhaps even a year. It is partly a supply shock as workers can no longer work and supply chains get severed. It is also partly a demand shock as people will cut back their demand, not just for restaurants and travel but likely much else throughout the economy given the extreme nervousness about their economic situation. The public health measures to flatten the curve, delaying and spreading out the extent of the virus, will necessarily and appropriately impose large economic costs. The job of economic policy is, to the greatest extent possible, to protect people from those costs now and help ensure the economy is in a position to rebound quickly when the health threat is contained. Doing this will require a multifaceted and ambitious policy response.

This column is taken from the VoxEU eBook Mitigating the COVID Economic Crisis: Act Fast and Do Whatever It Takes. Download the eBook here.

Human suffering in the immediate future

The human toll will be enormous. Most profound and consequential will be the toll on health – the illnesses and deaths from COVID-19 and also the collateral damage to others from an overloaded hospital system. Less profound, but even more widespread, will be the economic toll on workers who lose their jobs or see dramatic reductions in their incomes, either directly because they work in an industry that is shut down as a result of the pandemic or indirectly because they work in anything in the economy which is seeing less demand as a result of all of the income loss and dramatically worsened outlook for the future.

The economic problems could persist well after the pandemic is contained. It would be foolish just to think of what is happening as intertemporal substitution – people not going to restaurants today but then making up for it by going to even more restaurants next year. There are four interrelated reasons why the economic problems could be very persistent:
• Labour market matching means that unemployment rates can rise sharply but not fall sharply. In the US financial crisis, for example, the unemployment rate took less than two and a half years to rise from 4.4% to 10% but, seven years to recover. The pattern is similar in previous recoveries and in other countries, and is the result of the labour market matching process in which it is hard to connect people with jobs.
• Companies will go bankrupt throughout the economy, although the extent and magnitude will depend on the policy response. In some cases, these could be disorderly bankruptcies that separate firm-specific management capital, worker capital, and a nested set of arrangements and sever all of them simultaneously. Putting that back together will not be easy.
• Financial institutions could come under tremendous strain and, absent an ambitious policy response, the economic crisis could turn into a financial crisis. Banks had substantial amounts of capital going into the crisis, including both the required levels and additional countercyclical capital buffers in many countries, but not the United States. Business credit lines have already been drawn, loans will be extended or not repaid, and funding could be increasingly difficult – all threatening to freeze up the financial system.
• The global aftershocks could also be large. Some countries may succeed in containing the virus more quickly than others. Some countries may succeed in containing the economic and financial damage associated with the economy more quickly than others. A rolling set of epidemics in individual countries and economic crises in individual countries would create global limits on travel and continue to strain global supply chains.

The first is uncertainty. Macroeconomic policy is operating under substantial uncertainty at the best of times, given the impossibility of definitive evidence from randomised control trials and the fact that the key structural parameters of the economy are likely fluctuating over time. Now it is operating under massive uncertainty given that we do not know the duration of the pandemic, the duration of the steps that are being taken to flatten the curve, the effect all of these will have on the economy, and how economic policies work in this situation.

The second is time. The change in economic activity has been larger and more abrupt than anything anyone has ever experienced on a global basis. The US housing bubble peaked in 2006, European financial institutions started to have problems in the summer of 2007, economic activity slowed over the course of 2007 in the United States, Bear Stearns needed to be rescued in March 2008, and Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008. At times events went quickly, but for the most part the economic situation unfolded slowly. In contrast, each day brings more news about the pandemic and more news about economic closures. Policies that are operational as quickly as possible are necessary.

The third constraint is capacity. During the financial crisis, government employees showed up at their jobs; now many are teleworking and likely all will be soon. Many are scared and distracted by the spread of the virus. Some will get sick and die, or if they do not will care for and grieve for others who do. All of this applies to the people developing policies in places like legislatures, finance ministries and central banks. It also applies to the people implementing the policies. At the best of times it is hard to implement administratively complex new policies. And these are not the best of times.

These constraints have six implications:
• Better to do too much rather than too little. The current situation is one of radical uncertainty. And given this radical uncertainty, policy has to be based on a risk analysis of the cost of doing too little and the cost of doing too much. In this case the risk analysis is increasingly clear: the cost of doing too much is the time value of money, which right now is negative given the negative real interest rates. The cost of doing too little could potentially be enormous both in terms of immediate human suffering and a prolonged economic crisis that exceeds the one in the wake of the global financial crisis.
• Use existing mechanisms as much as possible. Franklin D. Roosevelt engaged in “bold and persistent experimentation” in combatting the Great Depression. This process unfolded over a decade. We do not want to be combatting the economic fallout of the pandemic over the course of a decade. Increase funds under existing channels of assistance rather than creating new ones; repeat policies that have been tried and worked (at least administratively) in the past.
• Invent new programmes where necessary. It will not be possible to use existing mechanisms for everything. The United States, for example, does not have paid leave or mandatory sick days so needs to invent and implement them in the middle of the pandemic. No country has sufficient mechanisms to deal with abrupt revenue stops in a large number of sectors across the economy.
• Diversify and do not fear duplication or unintended ‘winners’ in the response. Given the uncertainty about the economic situation, the impact of policies, and the new policies that are being invented, it is worth diversifying the response. Many policies will have to be tried. Some will work; others will not. Many will be wasteful, giving money to people or businesses that do not need it – or even giving it to the same ones twice. The risk of duplication is much smaller than the risk of over-targeting that leaves many out.
• Enlist the private sector as much as possible. The private sector will be operating under many of the same operational constraints as the government. But it has an existing infrastructure, can be nimble, and can form a diversification of the response. Direct government lending is hard, but loan guarantees can enlist the private sector to make the loans. The private sector will make the additional food and hospital equipment but will need financial incentives. Some will end up making a profit out of all of this, now is not the time to be squeamish.
• Ensure the response is dynamic and persistent. The damage is uncertain. It may vary across places. It may last a long time. Policy needs to be ready to stay in place and even grow in the places and times it is needed. The more that policies can have triggers to automatically continue and expand in places and times they are needed, the better.

What a policy response should look like

The exact policy response will vary from country to country but here are some ways to operationalise the principles above:
• Spare no expense on health. Testing, hospital systems, antiviral and vaccine research and anything else that is needed should be funded.
• Targeted assistance using existing programmes. In the United States this means expanding eligibility for unemployment insurance (although that is hard because eligibility rules vary across the 50 states and the District of Columbia), increasing the amount of benefits ($50 per week added), and expanding other programmes for the most vulnerable, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). In addition, increasing federal funding for states is critical and one of the best mechanisms for this. The United States is increasing the share of Medicaid paid by the federal government.
• Cash payments to households. M"|1
2020-05-30|"Unions said 8,000 people took part in the protest over the cuts designed to help Renault steer out of a cash crunch exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic (AFP Photo/FRANCOIS LO PRESTI)

Maubeuge (France) (AFP) - Thousands of workers rallied Saturday outside the Renault factory in northern France to protest the automaker's decision to cut 15,000 jobs worldwide, including 4,600 in France.

Unions said 8,000 people took part in the protest at the Maubeuge subsidiary over the cuts designed to help Renault steer out of a cash crunch exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.

The plant, which employs around 2,100 people, has been stopped since Friday.

Under the new plan, Maubeuge-based production of electric Kangoo utility vehicles is set to move to Douai, 70 kilometres (45 miles) away, much to the consternation of workers.

""It's an earthquake that is taking place. We want to keep our company here,"" Jerome Delvaux, a union member, told AFP.

""This demonstration today is very important, even if it is a first step, to show the government and Renault that workers and residents of this area are committed to this company and that we have support,"" Delvaux added.

""We need these jobs, otherwise it's a whole territory that will die,"" he said.

The company will target savings of more than two billion euros ($2.2 billion) over three years and turn its focus to electric vehicles as it seeks to restore competitiveness in a market reeling from slumping sales since the COVID-19 pandemic forced millions of people into home confinement for weeks on end.

Renault had been navigating turbulent waters even before the health crisis, starting with the shock arrest of its former boss Carlos Ghosn on financial misconduct charges in 2018 which led to deep rifts in its alliance with Japanese partners Nissan and Mitsubishi.

In February, the company unveiled its first annual loss in a decade, followed quickly by the 2020 health crisis that saw new car registrations in the European Union plunge 76.3 percent year-on-year in April.

In an ""adjustment"" plan announced to unions Thursday, Renault said nearly 4,600 jobs would be cut out of 48,000 in France, and more than 10,000 in the rest of the world -- some eight percent of the company's global workforce.

It would entail retraining, internal mobility and voluntary departures, spread out over three years, with no outright dismissals envisioned for now.

Four production sites in France could be closed or restructured, the automaker said, and its hulking factory at Flins northwest of Paris will stop making the Zoe electric hatchback from 2024."|0
2020-05-30|"Friday the 13th is consistently anticipated to be an eventful day among horror film fanatics and the subtly superstitious, but it is also a significant day in tattoo shops across the country. Sailors believed that tattooing the traditionally unlucky number 13 on their bodies would deter bad luck from following them, which encouraged others to flaunt the symbol with simple, spooky designs. Dallas tattoo artist Oliver Peck turned this trend into an event in the ‘90s and tattoo shops have been celebrating the mystic day with special events and mysteriously low prices — typically, $13 mysterious — since.

Ironically, Friday the 13th was the last time Durham’s Welcome Tattoo shop was operating normally.

The March 13 event was supposed to be a party — the owners booked Wonderpuff to serve gourmet cotton candy and planned giveaways for those who joined the gathering. The festivities, however, were quickly adapted to address the rising concerns about COVID-19 in the state. The owners modified this notoriously-crowded celebration into a first-come, first-served flash event. Clients could choose a piece of palm-sized flash for $130, and all proceeds went toward the nonprofit of the client’s choice. Welcome Tattoo maintained the artistry and convenient prices of each Friday the 13th, but sacrificed its electric atmosphere to protect the Durham community.

“We already clean a lot, as you can imagine,” owner Morgan Grimm said. “We just became extra aware of cleanliness, wiping down clipboards and door handles after every customer. We limited the number of people allowed in the shop at one time and only let in people who were actually being tattooed.”

Lively and inviting energy is necessary for a tattoo shop — even if buzzing needles and blood-stained gloves threaten your bravado, there is comfort in the echoing post-grunge playlists and muffled admiration for wall-hung collages. The dying vivacity within the tattoo shop was indicative of the impending shutdown. The shop voluntarily closed their doors two days later.

“It all happened so fast. We went from not hearing about anything coronavirus-related to being affected by it overnight,” Grimm said. “We felt that closing was the best thing to do for our community at the time.”

A week after Welcome Tattoo closed, Gov. Roy Cooper ordered personal care and grooming services to close by March 25 at 5 p.m. All barber shops, hair, nail, and beauty salons and massage and tattoo parlors were shut down due to their inability to provide service while social distancing. These businesses are dependent on in-person contact, and, as a result, are desperately struggling through the COVID-19 crisis. Restaurants and retail shops are undeniably experiencing financial losses, but they can still partially operate under current conditions. Tattoo artists, on the other hand, cannot deliver their product to your doorstep.

“I feel like [tattoo shops], nail techs, hairdressers, massage therapists, a lot of those in-person services are just in a complete standstill,” Grimm expressed. “There is really not much that can be done until we see a decline in cases.”

In addition to losing a steady source of revenue, many new businesses have not been operating long enough to qualify for small business loans. One-year-old Welcome Tattoo, too new to obtain such loans, has utilized creative methods of bringing in money. Grimm explained how one tattooer, Kohen Meyers, has been creating and selling his artwork in an unpromising attempt to earn an income as the pandemic prohibits his livelihood. The shop also hosted a raffle in which the winner would receive a free original flash design — designs that typically cost anywhere from $100 to $500.

Amid selling merchandise and hosting raffles for the shop, Welcome Tattoo’s main focus has been promoting other small businesses in Durham.Their Instagram page kindly pushes followers to donate to the Triangle Restaurant Workers Relief Fund for the chance to win a free flash tattoo.

“Right when we closed we did a big raffle for the Triangle Restaurant Workers Relief Fund. We realized we’re not the only ones going through this,” Grimm explained. “I think Durham has always been great about supporting local businesses, so it is nice that we can continue to do that.”

Ultimately, small businesses are depending on the support of consumers — their neighbors — to stay afloat. It may seem inconvenient to scope out a local business carrying the products you want instead of visiting your preferred cookie-cutter capitalist wonderland, but shopping small benefits the entire community. Not to mention, locally created products — from Pincho Loco’s refreshing ice cream to Heavenly Buffaloes’ late-night greasy satisfaction — allows customers to explore the city through innovative, artistic products crafted by people passionate about their work. They’re working for you. And right now, they need you more than ever.

“Buy from local shops and local restaurants as much as possible. Buy from them instead of Amazon or a major chain store. We’ve been buying groceries from our neighbor Accordion Club,” Grimm said. “What’s really important is that financial support. If you’re not able to financially support, then share what those businesses are doing with your friends and family on social media to help bring in customers.”

As a writer and reporter, I would typically end this article with some drawn-out moral message that I can only hope resonates with each reader. But as someone who loves and misses the Durham community, I would much rather ask you to support the local businesses and people that complete the Durham experience, even if your experience only lasts four years. Now is not the time to pretend I have some profound wisdom to share. If you are able to, please shop small. Shop local. Shop Durham."|2
2020-05-30|"SEATTLE -- Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan announced a city-wide curfew from 5:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. for Saturday and Sunday, May 30 and 31 after chaos broke out downtown.

“While most of those protests were peaceful, there have been isolated but significant events of violence and destruction. This temporary curfew is intended to preserve the health and safety of our residents by keeping our streets safe and accessible for essential workers and first responders and preventing the further spread of COVID-19,” said Mayor Durkan.

""The curfew is intended to prevent violence and widespread property damage, and to prevent the further community spread of COVID-19 through continued gathering,"" the city wrote in a news release.

""The temporary curfew does not impact people who need to commute to work during these hours, people experiencing homelessness, people in a medical emergency or people in a dangerous situation, first responders, health care workers, and the news media. In addition, the curfew does not require businesses to close while it is in effect, and it will not alter public transit schedules.""

Gov. Jay Inslee late Saturday announced that he activated up to 200 members of the National Guard. That was in response to a request from the city of Seattle to help manage a chaotic scene in downtown.

Multiple police cars were set on fire and destroyed near Westlake Center.

""The National Guard is on stand by to assist the Seattle Police Department as requested by Mayor Durkan,"" Inslee said. ""They will be unarmed and assist with infrastructure protection and crowd movement. They will only be utilized if absolutely necessary and we appreciate their efforts to help in this important work.""

Inslee said the guard personnel will be unarmed and be directed by Seattle officials, who requested the help to protect property and manage crowds who had gathered in response to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Thousands of people gathered in downtown Seattle to protest the killing of George Floyd and a largely peaceful gathering turned rowdier Saturday afternoon.

Police deployed flash bangs and pepper-sprayed some demonstrators who got close to police lines. Police on bicycles pushed back several protesters.

A police spokeswoman, Sgt. Lauren Truscott, said some people were arrested though she didn’t have an exact figure.

The Washington State Patrol closed both directions of Interstate 5 through downtown Seattle as a protest over the killing of George Floyd spilled onto the freeway Saturday afternoon.

""The freeway is not a safe or appropriate place for demonstration,” state patrol Chief John Batiste said in a statement.

2020-06-01|"Good morning, it’s June 1, 2020, a Monday morning perhaps like no other in the history of our republic. A hundred cities waking up to broken glass on the sidewalks, burned-out buildings, vulgar and threatening graffiti sprayed on buildings and streets. All this while a pandemic that has claimed 106,000 Americans remains unchecked. With most of the strictures that crashed the U.S. economy -- closing stadiums, museums, theaters, amusement parks, and basically the entire service sector -- still in place. Amid it all, none these interlocking crises have made our leading civic institutions any less partisan, apparently, and that includes the media.

Remember when social media was touted as an innovation that would help bring human beings together? Do you recall when the 24-hour news cycle was envisioned as a technological advancement that would keep Americans better informed?

Well, social media can bring people together. And it does, every day. The platforms can also be used to recruit terrorists, foreign and domestic. Likewise, cable news has the wherewithal to keep citizens better informed, but there are business considerations at play that mitigate the good, along with human considerations: political bias, personal pettiness, and the pressures of competition.

It was 40 years ago today that Ted Turner launched Cable News Network. In a moment I’ll offer an observation about this seminal development. First, I’d point you to RealClearPolitics’ front page, which presents our poll averages, videos, breaking news stories, and aggregated opinion pieces spanning the political spectrum. We also offer original material from our own reporters and contributors, including the following:

CNN’s first challenge, of course, was to be profitable. By the time of its launch, founder Ted Turner didn’t need the money -- he was a billionaire when that was rare -- but it needed to attract enough viewers and advertisers to justify the tremendous cost of fielding news crews around the country and the world, support a vigorous Washington bureau, and a home base in Atlanta.

Skeptics abounded. Was there even enough news? A New Yorker cartoon from the early days illustrated the problem: It depicted a dead bird, its feet in the air, with a CNN camera crew on the spot. “A sparrow falls,” read the caption, “and CNN goes live.”

In truth, those at the network’s creation knew right away they were on to something. Three days before the its launch, civil rights leader Vernon Jordan had been wounded in an attempted assassination. On June 1, President Jimmy Carter visited Jordan in the hospital -- and spoke to CNN’s cameras as he emerged.

“You know,” CNN script copy editor Randy Harber thought to himself, “this is going to work.”

Sometimes, it worked too well, such as on Jan. 28, 1986 when the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded in midair, and CNN anchors and correspondents found themselves trying to explain to Americans, including many children, why six astronauts and a popular schoolteacher were never coming home to their loved ones.

A milestone event came during the Persian Gulf War. By then, CNN had been meeting the challenge of live, 24-hour television for a decade, and proving itself up to the task. The established networks broke into their regular programming when the shooting started, but only CNN had a team on the scene at Baghdad’s Rashid Hotel when the airstrikes began.

In a free country, success will spawn imitators, and so it was with CNN. By 1989, Europe’s Sky News was on the air 24 hours a day and by the mid-1990s Rupert Murdoch -- who owned Sky News -- decided to give CNN a run for its money. Fox News Channel promised even higher production values than its rival, and something else as well: an ideological correction. “Fair and balanced” was the slogan coined by Roger Ailes, but this was said with a wink and a nod. What it really meant was that Fox News was going to offer ballast in a media marketplace dominated by liberal sensibilities. At first, CNN ignored the usurper, even as conservatives took to trolling CNN as the “Clinton News Network.”

Eventually, as Fox News consistently attracted more viewers than CNN and upstart MSNBC combined, a change of heart occurred. In the presidential 2012 campaign, MSNBC had emerged as the liberal alternative -- it was the Barack Obama network, if you will. Later, many observers would still view CNN as pro-Clinton even though a different Clinton was running for president. And Fox News remained reliably Republican in its orientation.

By 2013, none of this could be ignored. Writing in Politico, media critic Dylan Byers began an analysis of the problem with a provocative opening sentence aimed at the D.C. chattering class: “This is the quickest way to turn a pleasant dinner party into a shouting match: Posit that MSNBC is not as bad as Fox News, but rather worse than Fox News.”

Objectively, MSNBC was by then much worse than Fox, if one believes the mission of the news business is to offer facts rather than propaganda. An exhaustive Pew Research Center Study done earlier that year showed the 85% of MSNBC’s programming was devoted to opinion and only 15% to reporting. At Fox, the ratio was much better -- 55% opinion, and 45% news. CNN hadn’t yet reached the 50% tipping point, but it was getting close. By the time of Donald Trump’s election, it would -- without ever admitting it -- throw in the towel and join the Resistance.

On Sunday, as the NYPD tried to quell riots, CNN President Jeff Zucker let it slip that he is thinking of running for mayor of New York. Although this speculation isn’t new, it set off the predictable kvetching in conservative circles. You know, about Mike Bloomberg’s conflicts of interest as the founder-of-Bloomberg-News-turned-mayor-turned-2020-Democratic-presidential-candidate. And about whether the Democratic Party would owe Zucker back pay -- that sort of thing. But this critique misses the mark. The great British journalist Charles Prestwich Scott was a liberal member of Parliament before assuming ownership and editorship of the Manchester Guardian. But the man still knew what a news outlet was for.

Ninety-nine years ago this spring, he penned an essay long considered the gold standard for independent journalism. The primary goal of the media, Scott asserted, was accurate reporting. “Comment is free,” he wrote, “but facts are sacred.”"|0
2020-06-01|"DILLON — Restaurants across the state were allowed to open at 50% capacity on Wednesday, May 27, in a step toward the reopening process after the full COVID-19 shutdown. Dining establishments throughout Summit County opened their patios and half of their restaurants to guests. While there were some visitors, patrons were mostly cooped-up locals eager to dine-in at their favorite restaurants.

Castaways Cove Kitchen Manager Kaleb Anderson said that most of the people who came to the restaurant’s reopening day Thursday were those who have routinely supported the restaurant prior to and during the shutdown. Anderson said that hopefully the reopening of hotels will drum up more business as well since this has been a draw for local restaurants in the past.

Despite the new protocols in place, Anderson said things around the restaurant aren’t “too terribly different” aside from that the restaurant is spending more money on gloves, Anderson joked, and taking the time to come up with new recipes. He said Castaways Cove currently has about 75% of its original staff and will eventually bring everyone back.

“It was pretty good, a little quiet, but we saw a lot of our regulars that came back for the first day which was great to see,” owner Bonnie Lehman said.

Like other restaurants that are currently reopening, Arapahoe Cafe has posted their new protocols and guest requirements on their website, which include the requirement that guests wear masks upon entering the restaurant or patio and that “everything a customer might have touched will be sanitized after every use.”

The cafe has a patio that allows for 6 feet of distancing between tables and has been preferred by guests — both for comfort during the pandemic as well as in the wake of warm spring weather. Lehman said it is an adjustment to have tables in the dining room and the pub 6 feet apart as employees are used to having a packed restaurant, but that the restaurant is always under strict protocols from the health department, making additional sanitation efforts fairly easy to work in.

“It’s actually been an easier adjustment than we kind of thought it would be,” Lehman said. “I think the biggest thing is the employees adjusting to wearing a mask the whole shift … but outside of that, the sanitation policies we put in place have been fairly easy to kind of just work into our normal routines of being at work, so that’s been pretty easy.”

Lehman said a timer goes off every 30 minutes reminding employees to perform their recurring sanitation duties, such as sanitizing bathrooms, point-of-sale systems and other commonly touched spaces, surfaces and objects. Lehman also noted that the restaurant has seen a mix of locals and visitors who are up for the day or who are camping over the course of the first few days of being open. Lehman said she expects to see more visitors once hotels open. The restaurant is still seeing a fair amount of to-go orders as well.

As for filling the restaurant to capacity, Lehman said Arapahoe Cafe will reach their 50% limit during certain rushes, such as dinnertime in the pub, but that people clear out after the rush.

“We’re just waiting for the next wave of reopenings, if we can open to 75% … but until then we’re just happy to have customers in the building,” Lehman said.

Lehman said she was able to bring back all of her winter staff and is preparing to bring on more staff for the summer as is the restaurant’s typical strategy.

Columbine Cafe opened its doors right away on Wednesday. Owner Robert Simonton said business is “gradually picking up” as the days go on and compared the current state of the cafe to that of past mud seasons. Simonton said he has had mainly locals come in so far to eat at physically distanced tables set up inside and four tables outside.

While outside tables have filled up, Simonton said he has yet to fill up for both indoor and outdoor seating. Simonton said things aren’t too much different aside from how the inside of the restaurant looks with separating tarps set up. He echoed Lehman’s sentiment that restaurants like his already have fairly rigorous sanitation procedures in place, so amping this element up isn’t a major change.

“Restaurants are pretty much one of the cleanest places you’ll go to,” Simonton said."|2

2020-06-01|"Art Green introduces the Oxfam Trailwalker campaign, which is being held in Taranaki in 2021.

A large charity walking and running event is to be held in Taranaki for the next three years.

The Oxfam Trailwalker, which raises money for Oxfam's humanitarian work, will be held in New Plymouth from 2021.

The first Taranaki event, which usually attracts about 1000 entrants, as well as 1500 supporters, will be held from March 20-21.

First held in 2006, teams of four cover 50km in 18 hours or 100km in 36 hours together - it is not a relay.

 * Records fall at Oxfam's 100km fundraiser race



The 2020 event, which was to be held in Whakatāne for the fifth and final year, was cancelled due to Covid-19.

Following a tender process with pitches from councils across the country, Taranaki was chosen on a number of criteria, including the variety of landscape and the accessibility from Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.

But it is not a highest-bid process, Oxfam said.

In a statement, New Plymouth mayor Neil Holdom said the event would be a major boost to the region as it recovers from the coronavirus-induced economic downturn.

""It’s another major event in our beautiful region as we continue to build a lifestyle capital and it will be a superb showcase for our wonderful corner of Aotearoa.""

Venture Taranaki chief executive Justine Gilliland said the event will bring a significant boost to the Taranaki economy.

Oxfam New Zealand executive director Rachael Le Mesurier said they hoped the Taranaki community would enjoy being part of it.

""We are delighted with the support of our Taranaki hosts, as the spirit of local hospitality and encouragement will make all the difference as hundreds of walkers set out to challenge poverty over 50 or 100 kilometres.

""We also look forward to seeing many Taranaki locals stepping out on the start line or supporting in some other way, as we make history with the first Oxfam Trailwalker in the region.""

The event typically raises close to a million dollars each year to support projects in the Pacific and around the world.

This will now include providing support to those hit doubly hard by poverty and the coronavirus pandemic."|2
2020-06-01|"After her university closed in March, Jeannine Randall sat down to adapt her research plan for a pandemic. Her project to monitor tree swallows through the spring and summer with a team of three scientists would now require travelling to the nesting sites in separate vehicles, using individual work kits, staying 2 metres apart and, of course, sanitizing regularly. When she realized hand sanitizer was in short supply in shops, she made her own batch using ethanol from her lab.

Now, as her school, the University of Northern British Columbia in Prince George, Canada, resumes some services, she is putting the plan into action: counting eggs, waiting for hatchlings and watching the birds from daybreak to sundown. “I think scientists are very well placed in some ways to come up with a protocol that makes sense and then follow it,” says Randall, an avian ecologist.

As countries around the world begin lifting pandemic lockdowns, researchers are entering a new phase of work — donning masks with their lab coats, staggering hours in laboratory spaces and taking shifts on shared instruments. Some universities have created detailed plans to track and test staff, and many have limited the capacity of indoor spaces and the flow of people through hallways and entrances. For others, post-lockdown plans are still taking shape. And whereas some universities have worked in lockstep with governments to formulate safety plans, others have charted their own paths.

Cull, release or bring them home: Coronavirus crisis forces hard decisions for labs with animals

University associations in the United States estimate that research there will need a boost of at least US$26 billion to get back up to speed. Among them, the Association of American Universities in Washington DC is drafting a set of priorities for university leaders to consider as they tackle reopening.

Of more than 3,000 researchers who responded to an online Nature reader poll last month, just under half said that they are still on lockdown. Following national policy trends, scientists in the United Kingdom, United States and Brazil were among the most likely to report restrictions, whereas only about 7% of those from Germany did (see ‘Getting back to business’). “Now, we are mostly back to normal, apart from wearing face masks and having to maintain a certain distance between each other,” says Boyan Garvalov, a cancer researcher at Heidelberg University, who juggles his career with monitoring his kids’ online learning. He currently splits time at home with his spouse, trading shifts at work.

Gloves and masks at all times

In Italy, which was hit particularly hard early in the global pandemic, nearly 30% of roughly 90 respondents to the Nature poll say that they have returned to work, and another 18% report having worked throughout lockdowns. One of these is cell biologist Paolo Bernardi, who went into the University of Padua nearly every working day to oversee a skeleton staff and teach his pathophysiology class over Zoom. “Now we are seeing better days,” Bernardi says. His lab is at about 50% capacity. University guidelines for resuming work, in effect since 26 April, require distances of 1 metre between people in brief contact, increased to 2 metres for those occupying the same room for more than 15 minutes; masks are to be worn at all times and gloves are compulsory in the lab. Capacity is limited to three people to a room, conference rooms are closed and meetings must still take place through calls or videoconferencing. Bernardi is comfortable with the university’s balance of safety and flexibility.

A year without conferences? How the coronavirus pandemic could change research

At the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, researchers have been asked to avoid working with hazardous chemicals when they can, to minimize the risk of spills that would require medical attention, according to Jana Volaric, a synthetic organic chemist. But for her, the biggest impact is the diminished conference schedule. She had hoped to be networking in anticipation of being on the job market next year, and she says that meaningful interactions are harder to come by at online conferences. “This is the most disappointing part.”

‘Singing from the same song sheet’

Organic chemist Kirsty Anderson lost about four weeks of work when the University of Auckland in New Zealand closed down along with the rest of the country. It reopened partially a few weeks ago, and instituted many of the restrictions seen in Europe. But it also required people who entered the building to mark their time of entry and location on timesheets, and maintain a distance of 2 metres between people at all times. With lift access restricted to one person at a time, she often climbed the seven flights of stairs to get to the lab. With more services opening in mid-May, the check-in database is now online.

She and her colleagues are taking odd- and even-hour rotations at their office desks to meet the university’s spacing requirements. Shared instruments such as the nuclear magnetic resonance and mass-spectroscopy tools are run by designated operators to minimize contact — Anderson hands over samples, wiped before drop-off, and sends codes and instructions through a shared online document.

How countries are using genomics to help avoid a second coronavirus wave

Winston Byblow, a neuroscientist who studies motor function after strokes at the University of Auckland, says the government and university are united in their safety messaging and pandemic response. “Everyone is singing from the same song sheet,” he says. He’s worried, however, that experiments with human participants might take a hit for a while. People are going to be wary about taking part in trials for many months, because of concerns about being in enclosed spaces with others, he says. “If recruitment rates drop because of uncertainty or fear, then it just means that it’s going to take a lot longer to complete the research, and that comes at a cost.”

Other universities are striking out on their own. Jorge Huete-Pérez is a molecular biologist and vice-president at the University of Central America in Managua, a private university with about 8,000 students. The institution formulated its own lockdown plan — reducing the number of people on campus by about 90% — independent of the Nicaraguan government, which put in place no measures to mitigate the virus’s spread. The pandemic arrived late in Central America, and reports put the total number of cases in Nicaragua at less than 800. But Huete-Pérez thinks the real number is higher, more in step with or perhaps higher than the 1,000 cases reported in neighbouring Costa Rica, and roughly 5,000 in Honduras. “We don’t really know the real dimensions of the COVID situation,” he says. When it is time reopen, in the absence of guidelines from the Nicaraguan government, he anticipates that he will look to independent medical organizations and the WHO, to inform the university’s plan.

To set coronavirus policy, model lives and livelihoods in lockstep

In the United States, as the presidential administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clashed over the plan for a post-pandemic return to work, the University of California, San Diego, drafted a detailed one of its own, including an ambitious screening and testing regime for staff and students, to come into effect in the autumn, that relies on campus labs to process samples. The pilot phase, begun on May 11, tested more than 1,000 students and ended last week.

But that approach is something of an anomaly. In the United States, policies and priorities can differ drastically between states. “The situation is changing pretty rapidly and the stakes are very high,” says Peter Schiffer, a physicist and former vice-provost for research at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who is a senior fellow at the AAU. A number of universities have adjusted their schedules or delayed students’ return to campus until next year, but have yet to firm up plans for researchers.

The logistics are unparalleled says Tobin Smith, vice-president for policy at the AAU. “This is all new territory.”"|2

FROM DEAGU in South Korea to Qom in Iran, Mulhouse in France and Sacramento in California, places of collective worship have often been accelerators of coronavirus contagion. Months later, with lockdowns starting to ease in the rich world, some religious groups have been loudly demanding a return to normality, and complaining that their needs have been forgotten.

In France houses of worship have opened earlier than planned because of a successful appeal by conservative religious groups to the Council of State, the highest administrative court. And the High Court in London has agreed to hear an appeal from a mosque leader in Bradford, a stronghold of Islam, who says stopping Friday prayers curbed his religious liberty.

The clash between religious and secular authority is felt most keenly in America. On May 29th the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to reject an appeal from a church in California, South Bay United Pentecostal, against restrictions imposed by the state’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom. Conservative court members saw merit in the church’s complaint that the constitutional right to free exercise of religion was being violated, but they were overruled. Often President Donald Trump’s administration has sided with churches in disputes with local or state authorities seeking to enforce stay-at-home orders. On May 22nd Mr Trump demanded the re-opening of churches, deeming them “essential”.

Covid-19 has exacerbated not only tension between churches and states, but also disagreements between different religious tendencies. Religious figures have denounced one another, either for being too reckless or for being too meekly compliant with government orders.

These disputes may be a symptom of a wider phenomenon. In the words of Austen Ivereigh, a biographer of Pope Francis, the virus has “deepened existing fault-lines and exposed a few new ones” in the realm of religion. For example, he says, some believers see in the covid crisis a deadly threat to religious liberty; others dismiss that view. Those fault-lines are particularly evident in liberal-democratic countries where practising religion of any kind or style, or firmly rejecting religion, is an open choice, not a default mode.

To understand the biggest chasm, imagine two camps that are defined by what they fear and dislike most. In one are religious groups whose strongest impulse is to improve the material lot of humanity, by fighting poverty or pollution. They are open to working with secular agencies, including governments and supra-national bodies, where they can be a force for the common good. In the other camp, faith communities believe the main challenge is secularism, the watering-down of old certainties, the threat posed by new thinking about sex and gender—all perceived evils deemed to be perpetrated by liberal elites and secular government authorities.

The fault-line does not neatly separate religions; it often divides denominations. Take the split in Catholic ranks. In his response to the pandemic, Pope Francis reaffirmed his preference for the more humanitarian camp by establishing a high-level panel to advise not just on the disease itself but also on the challenges that will follow: unemployment, strained welfare budgets, the need for new definitions of economic value. On May 31st he marked the feast of Pentecost by leading a sparse, mask-wearing flock in prayers in St Peter’s Square; he urged special concern for the world’s vulnerable, including the indigenous people of the Amazon, “that they may not lack health care.” The readmission of a well-policed crowd marked some relief from the empty expanse which Francis faced seven weeks earlier at Easter.

Yet the pope’s declared opponents, including Raymond Burke, an American cardinal, have redoubled their attacks on him for being too compliant with worldly authorities which may have dark agendas. In chastising restrictions preventing the faithful from going to mass, Cardinal Burke wrote: “We cannot simply accept the determinations of secular governments, which would treat the worship of God in the same manner as going to a restaurant or to an athletic contest.” He has also aligned himself with conspiracy theorists in suggesting that the virus might lead to compulsory vaccines or even the subcutaneous microchipping of people by an all-controlling state.

To a degree the divide splits Europe and America, in part because of their differing collective memories. Americans abhor state-imposed religious orthodoxy, whereas Europeans have a theocratic tradition whose current form is emollient. The humanitarian camp is much stronger in Europe, at least among established Christian hierarchies. Bishops have raised few objections to locked-down churches, but they have weighed in on social and political issues. In Britain, for example, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, the head of England’s established church, warned the government against returning to austerity to repay the fast-rising pile of public debt. Several other bishops openly rebuked Dominic Cummings, a prime-ministerial adviser who made a long road-trip during a lockdown.

In some European countries, observers have seen a subtle Christian influence in policy responses to the virus, always working with the grain of the liberal state, not against it. In Germany, for example, theologians have taken part in a commission that pondered how to allocate medical resources in an acute crisis: it concluded that a person’s ability to recover—but not age itself—should be a criterion.

On both the secular and religious right in the United States, by contrast, the argument has sometimes been made that saving the old and vulnerable should not always take priority over saving the economy, or simply practising religion. Rusty Reno, editor of an influential religious journal, First Things, made waves by arguing that it was un-Christian to focus too much on avoiding death. “There are many things more precious than life. And yet we have been whipped into such a frenzy in New York that most family members will forgo visiting sick parents,” he complained, in a much-contested editorial.

On May 11th he tweeted that wearing masks was tantamount to “enforced cowardice”. That prompted Rod Dreher, another widely read pundit, to describe his fellow conservative’s utterance as “contemptible”. Mr Reno subsequently withdrew the tweet and apologised. Meanwhile, in California an influential Orthodox priest, Josiah Trenham, has rejoiced in recent days over the widespread “civil disobedience” by the state’s churches which was, in his view, forcing the governor to retreat from a “large, unjustified over-reach of the civil authority” in curbing the practice of faith.

These “theocon” objections to the lockdowns have been advanced on roughly three grounds: that they damage the economy, that public worship is more important than anything else people do, and that human freedom to do anything at all is being unfairly restricted. Such things would be hard to say in Europe. One of the many reasons for that, according to religion-watchers, is the European reading of Christianity, especially in the post-1945 era when the continent’s leading thinkers, secular and religious, have had a horror of any attitude that favoured cold economic or ideological calculation over basic decency.

Among Europe’s Christian Democrats, like those who dominate German politics, this religious influence is acknowledged in varying degrees. And even Scandinavian social democracy, on the face of things a godless creed, has clear historic roots in the region’s Lutheran tradition which emphasises good citizenship, says Nick Spencer of Theos, a London think-tank. For pious traditionalists, that Nordic example is a warning, not an inspiration: wherever religion merges with social welfare, they would retort, it virtually ceases to exist.

Still, not all religious disputes have got worse. One of the pandemic’s surprises is that traditional faith communities, as well as newfangled ones, have responded creatively to the need for new forms of worship. In one German town, a Catholic priest and a female Lutheran minister experimented with a drive-in service where people could enjoy the singing and preaching through their car radios. To a traditionalist Catholic, this mixing of sexes, denominations and rites breaks every rule of church order. But plainly some of the faithful like it, and they may want more."|1
2020-06-02|"Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Adam Fortais had never attended a virtual conference. Now he’s sold on them — and doesn’t want to go back to conventional, in-person gatherings.

That’s because of his experience of helping to instigate some virtual sessions for the March meeting of the American Physical Society (APS), after the organization cancelled the regular conference at short notice. “If given the option, I think I would almost always choose to do the virtual one,” says Fortais, a physicist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. “It just seems better to me in almost all ways.”

Fortais could get his wish. Since the coronavirus spread worldwide in early March, many scientific conferences scheduled for the first half of the year have migrated online, and organizers of meetings due to take place in the second half of 2020 are deciding whether they will go fully or partially virtual. Some researchers hope that the pandemic will finally push scientific societies to embrace a shift towards online conferences — a move that many scientists have long desired for environmental reasons and to allow broader participation.

Scientists with disabilities and parents of young children are just two examples of the researchers who are benefiting from online meetings, says Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. Cobb has been cutting back her own air travel since 2017, both to reduce her personal carbon footprint and to blaze a trail towards structural change in her discipline. She hopes the changes as a result of the pandemic will last long after it has ended. “In five years, we’ll be in a remarkably different place.”

But other researchers say that in-person conferences will once again dominate after the threat of COVID-19 has faded. For them, in-person meetings offer too many opportunities that virtual meetings can’t replicate.

Estimates of the carbon cost of conferences vary, but range from 0.5 to 2 or more tonnes of carbon dioxide per participant in travel alone. If each of the estimated 7.8 million researchers in the world travelled to one conference every year, the lower bound of the annual carbon emissions would be roughly equivalent to those of some small nations.

Sputnik moment or budget breaker: How will the pandemic alter research funding?

Before the pandemic, many scientific societies had already begun exploring how to make virtual participation available for researchers who were unable or unwilling to travel. When the crisis hit, it forced them to speed up existing discussions and timelines. “We were going to start out with smaller meetings,” says Hunter Clemens, director of meetings at the APS. Instead, the society scrambled to move its annual April meeting online in a matter of weeks. Despite the accelerated timeline, Clemens says, the virtual meeting was “something amazing”.

That gathering, which took place on 18–21 April, drew more than 7,000 registrants — about four times more than its in-person attendance in a normal year, says Clemens. And almost all of them — around 96% — logged on to the conference at some point. The virtual sessions, on average, had higher attendance than in-person ones at standard APS April conferences.

Attendees say that virtual meetings are better in certain respects. Submitting questions online through moderated chats, for example, can help graduate students to feel less intimidated and allow scientists to formulate better queries. At the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in April, the ability of the audience to vote on questions in real time “resulted in a higher quality of question”, says Emily Costa, a cancer researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.

Universities will never be the same after the coronavirus crisis

Adam Tidball, a physicist at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, saw another benefit when he presented at the APS virtual April meeting. “I found that the networking was a lot better than in-person,” says Tidball. The conference provided attendees with a sort of matchmaking app for networking, with which users could read other scientists’ biographies and reach out to them to initiate a conversation or schedule a time to meet virtually.

The economics of online meetings are different from those of conventional ones. Clemens estimates that the virtual April meeting cost only about 45% of the equivalent in-person conference, although the society lost money on this year’s meeting because it had to make the shift so quickly and didn’t charge for attendance. The American Astronomical Society has had more time to plan its online-only meeting in June, and the cost to attend is around 60% cheaper than it was for its January meeting.

But the shift to online meetings could shrink one of the major revenue streams for societies, some of which draw a large fraction of their operating budget from their annual meeting. And if societies move to hold a dual online and in-person meeting, that could drive up costs because the meeting would require more staff, and both a venue and an online platform.

Researchers who have attended virtual meetings say that the meetings have several important downsides. Poster presentations can fall flat in an online space, and it’s difficult to have serendipitous encounters between sessions, which is where a lot of collaboration normally happens. Social scientist Marzena Świgoń says that unofficial chats during conferences are the most important way that scientists share knowledge with each other. “I think that virtual conferences are only temporary,” says Świgoń, who is at the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Poland. “As soon as the threat passes, conferences will return in their traditional form.”

Coronavirus and COVID-19: Keep up to date

Anthony Watkinson, an information scientist at CIBER Research in Newbury, UK, who has co-authored papers with Świgoń, is similarly sceptical of the permanence of virtual conferences. He says that UK and US researchers overwhelmingly report that in-person interactions are necessary for forging relationships.

Among many scientists, however, there is a clear mandate for at least providing the option to participate virtually. In an informal survey conducted by Nature, roughly 80% of 486 respondents said they thought that some meetings should continue to be held virtually, at least in some capacity, after the pandemic has subsided.

Now that the idea of a virtual meeting is less abstract, Cobb says, people might be more willing to open up conferences, meetings and seminars to remote participation. “I do honestly believe there will be some remnants of this that resonate on for many years.”"|0
2020-06-02|"As the pandemic’s economic toll grows around the world, some experts fear it could harm science for decades by putting many thousands of researchers out of work and forcing nations to slash funding as they rebuild societies. Others say the pandemic could highlight the importance of science and spur long-term support, especially for basic research, much as the Second World War did.

In the United States, where the rate of unemployment has risen towards levels last seen during the 1930s, many science leaders are trying to make the case that supporting research and development is crucial. “Without science to help, the country is in jeopardy,” says Harold Varmus, the Nobel-prizewinning cancer scientist who led the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) between 1993 and 1999.

In the wake of the pandemic, the biological sciences might thrive, in the way that the 1957 launch of Sputnik — the beach-ball-sized Soviet satellite that set off the space race — yielded decades of research and discovery in the physical sciences. “Researchers go where the money is,” says Julia Phillips, a member of the US National Science Board and former chief technology officer at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

The long-term economic consequences for science will vary significantly by country. Australia, for example, has warned that 7,000 university research jobs are at risk this year, whereas science remains largely intact in Germany, which is committed to investing an additional €17 billion (US$18 billion) in science agencies through to 2030, at a steady 3% increase in budgets annually. And although China’s economy and scientific momentum were slammed by the coronavirus, the country is poised to recover relatively quickly. It’s possible there could be a shuffling of priorities, leading the country to invest more in biology and epidemiology, says Cong Cao, a sociologist at the University of Nottingham campus in Ningbo, China.

Some of the most drastic changes could come in the United States, one of the world’s largest funders of scientific research and a country where spending decisions are made annually, unlike some other nations.

Several science-policy specialists have been looking to the last economic shock, the recession of 2007–09, for clues to the future. After that downturn, the US government doled out extra money to federal science agencies to jump-start programmes as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), a national plan to boost activity across all sectors (see ‘Funding waves’). The NIH, for example, received an extra US$10.8 billion in 2009 on top of the $30-billion annual budget. The ARRA fund was “an enormous amount of money” at the time, says Jennifer Zeitzer, director of legislative relations at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB), in Bethesda, Maryland.

The need this year is expected to eclipse that episode. In early April, a coalition of groups representing US universities asked Congress to provide $26 billion to science-funding agencies to support the scientific workforce and the reopening of academic labs. The funding could, for example, buffer delayed grants, re-establish colonies of mice that had to be killed and replenish stores of personal protective equipment that were donated to the pandemic effort.

So far, of the roughly $3 trillion in emergency money approved by Congress, nearly $4 billion has been directed at federal science agencies for coronavirus-related work, including developing vaccines and treatments. Groups such as FASEB expect hiring freezes and lab shrinkages to hit early-career faculty members and graduate students particularly hard. “What happens next? Obviously, we’re very worried,” Zeitzer says.

Universities will never be the same after the coronavirus crisis

Even in past economic crises, US science has received steady support from the government and industry, with total funding rising more than tenfold since the 1950s, when adjusted for inflation. The business sector accounts for some 70% of spending on basic, applied and translational research. But the US government remains the country’s biggest funder of basic science, making an investment of around $121 billion in 2017.

Although Congress has steadily increased federal dollars spent on science year-on-year, a big economic shock could trip up that trend. “Then you can see a scenario where in fact, the budgets for research agencies will go down,” says Elias Zerhouni, a physician who led the NIH between 2002 and 2008.

Such a blow could tip the balance between basic and applied research. In the past, budget crunches have favoured experimental and applied science over blue-sky research, says Phillips. And if that were to happen now, the United States could lose its competitive edge decades down the road. “The horizon moves in,” she says.

Coronavirus and COVID-19: Keep up to date

But, at a time when the coronavirus response has the attention of the public and lawmakers, this could also be an opportunity for universities and scientists to ask for more, says Varmus. “I think that the country is in a position now to appreciate what science has the potential to offer when the country is challenged. Moreover, they have the ability to recognize the economic consequences of not being better prepared.”

In fact, several US lawmakers have introduced legislation to dramatically boost funding for the National Science Foundation. They propose giving the agency $100 billion over 5 years, compared to its current annual budget of around $8 billion. The chances of the plan becoming law remain unclear, but Zeitzer expects it would be a smaller amount if it did.

Science in the United Kingdom might fare better than in the United States. In March, the government announced a bold plan to increase research funding from £9 billion (US$11 billion) a year to £22 billion by 2024–25. So far, there are no signs that commitment will change, says James Wilsdon, who studies science and technology policy at the University of Sheffield, UK. “Clearly, if the overall financial outlook is seriously damaged in terms of a prolonged recession or depression, then all bets are off.”"|0
2020-06-02|"Not even Trump’s supporters can contest this analogy, because the imposition of an alien ideology is precisely what he was calling for all along. Trump’s first statement as president, his inaugural address, was an unprecedented assault on American democracy and American values. Remember: He described America’s capital city, America’s government, America’s congressmen and senators—all democratically elected and chosen by Americans, according to America’s 227-year-old Constitution—as an “establishment” that had profited at the expense of “the people.” “Their victories have not been your victories,” he said. “Their triumphs have not been your triumphs.” Trump was stating, as clearly as he possibly could, that a new set of values was now replacing the old, though of course the nature of those new values was not yet clear. Almost as soon as he stopped speaking, Trump launched his first assault on fact-based reality, a long-undervalued component of the American political system. We are not a theocracy or a monarchy that accepts the word of the leader or the priesthood as law. We are a democracy that debates facts, seeks to understand problems, and then legislates solutions, all in accordance with a set of rules. Trump’s insistence—against the evidence of photographs, television footage, and the lived experience of thousands of people—that the attendance at his inauguration was higher than at Barack Obama’s first inauguration represented a sharp break with that American political tradition. Like the authoritarian leaders of other times and places, Trump effectively ordered not just his supporters but also apolitical members of the government bureaucracy to adhere to a blatantly false, manipulated reality. American politicians, like politicians everywhere, have always covered up mistakes, held back information, and made promises they could not keep. But until Trump was president, none of them induced the National Park Service to produce doctored photographs or compelled the White House press secretary to lie about the size of a crowd—or encouraged him to do so in front of a press corps that knew he knew he was lying. It takes time to persuade people to abandon their existing value systems. The process usually begins slowly, with small changes. The lie was petty, even ridiculous; that was partly why it was so dangerous. In the 1950s, when an insect known as the Colorado potato beetle appeared in Eastern European potato fields, Soviet-backed governments in the region triumphantly claimed that it had been dropped from the sky by American pilots, as a deliberate form of biological sabotage. Posters featuring vicious red-white-and-blue beetles went up all across Poland, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia. No one really believed the charge, including the people making it, as archives have subsequently shown. But that didn’t matter. The point of the posters was not to convince people of a falsehood. The point was to demonstrate the party’s power to proclaim and promulgate a falsehood. Sometimes the point isn’t to make people believe a lie—it’s to make people fear the liar.

Read: The saddest part of the anonymous ‘New York Times’ op-ed Instead, Anonymous concluded that remaining inside the system, where they could cleverly distract and restrain the president, was the right course for public servants like them. Anonymous was not alone. Gary Cohn, at the time the White House economic adviser, told Bob Woodward that he’d removed papers from the president’s desk to prevent him from pulling out of a trade agreement with South Korea. James Mattis, Trump’s original secretary of defense, stayed in office because he thought he could educate the president about the value of America’s alliances, or at least protect some of them from destruction. This kind of behavior has echoes in other countries and other times. A few months ago, in Venezuela, I spoke with Víctor Álvarez, a minister in one of Hugo Chávez’s governments and a high-ranking official before that. Álvarez explained to me the arguments he had made in favor of protecting some private industry, and his opposition to mass nationalization. Álvarez was in government from the late 1990s through 2006, a time when Chávez was stepping up the use of police against peaceful demonstrators and undermining democratic institutions. Still, Álvarez remained, hoping to curb Chávez’s worst economic instincts. Ultimately, he did quit, after concluding that Chávez had created a loyalty cult around himself—Álvarez called it a “subclimate” of obedience—and was no longer listening to anyone who disagreed. Anne Applebaum: Venezuela is the eerie endgame of modern politics In authoritarian regimes, many insiders eventually conclude that their presence simply does not matter. Cohn, after publicly agonizing when the president said there had been “fine people on both sides” at the deadly white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, finally quit when the president made the ruinous decision to put tariffs on steel and aluminum, a decision that harmed American businesses. Mattis reached his breaking point when the president abandoned the Kurds, America’s longtime allies in the war against the Islamic State. But although both resigned, neither Cohn nor Mattis has spoken out in any notable way. Their presence inside the White House helped build Trump’s credibility among traditional Republican voters; their silence now continues to serve the president’s purposes. As for Anonymous, we don’t know whether he or she remains inside the administration. For the record, I note that Álvarez lives in Venezuela, an actual police state, and yet is willing to speak out against the system he helped create. Cohn, Mattis, and Anonymous, all living freely in the United States of America, have not been nearly so brave. I, personally, will benefit. These, of course, are words that few people ever say out loud. Perhaps some do quietly acknowledge to themselves that they have not resigned or protested because it would cost them money or status. But no one wants a reputation as a careerist or a turncoat. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, even Markus Wolf sought to portray himself as an idealist. He had truly believed in Marxist-Leninist ideals, this infamously cynical man told an interviewer in 1996, and “I still believe in them.” Many people in and around the Trump administration are seeking personal benefits. Many of them are doing so with a degree of openness that is startling and unusual in contemporary American politics, at least at this level. As an ideology, “Trump First” suits these people, because it gives them license to put themselves first. To pick a random example: Sonny Perdue, the secretary of agriculture, is a former Georgia governor and a businessman who, like Trump, famously refused to put his agricultural companies into a blind trust when he entered the governor’s office. Perdue has never even pretended to separate his political and personal interests. Since joining the Cabinet he has, with almost no oversight, distributed billions of dollars of “compensation” to farms damaged by Trump’s trade policies. He has stuffed his department with former lobbyists who are now in charge of regulating their own industries: Deputy Secretary Stephen Censky was for 21 years the CEO of the American Soybean Association; Brooke Appleton was a lobbyist for the National Corn Growers Association before becoming Censky’s chief of staff, and has since returned to that group; Kailee Tkacz, a member of a nutritional advisory panel, is a former lobbyist for the Snack Food Association. The list goes on and on, as would lists of similarly compromised people in the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and elsewhere. Perdue’s department also employs an extraordinary range of people with no experience in agriculture whatsoever. These modern apparatchiks, hired for their loyalty rather than their competence, include a long-haul truck driver, a country-club cabana attendant, the owner of a scented-candle company, and an intern at the Republican National Committee. The long-haul truck driver was paid $80,000 a year to expand markets for American agriculture abroad. Why was he qualified? He had a background in “hauling and shipping agricultural commodities.” A friend told me that each time he sees Lindsey Graham, “he brags about having just met with Trump” while exhibiting “high school” levels of excitement, as if “a popular quarterback has just bestowed some attention on a nerdy debate-club leader.” I must remain close to power. Another sort of benefit, harder to measure, has kept many people who object to Trump’s policies or behavior from speaking out: the intoxicating experience of power, and the belief that proximity to a powerful person bestows higher status. This, too, is nothing new. In a 1968 article for The Atlantic, James Thomson, an American East Asia specialist, brilliantly explained how power functioned inside the U.S. bureaucracy in the Vietnam era. When the war in Vietnam was going badly, many people did not resign or speak out in public, because preserving their “effectiveness”—“a mysterious combination of training, style, and connections,” as Thomson defined it—was an all-consuming concern. He called this “the effectiveness trap”: The inclination to remain silent or to acquiesce in the presence of the great men—to live to fight another day, to give on this issue so that you can be “effective” on later issues—is overwhelming. Nor is it the tendency of youth alone; some of our most senior officials, men of wealth and fame, whose place in history is secure, have remained silent lest their connection with power be terminated. In any organization, private or public, the boss will of course sometimes make decisions that his underlings dislike. But when basic principles are constantly violated, and people constantly defer resignation—“I can always fall on my sword next time”—then misguided policies go fatal"|0
2020-06-02|"Queries about employment rights to free legal advice centres have almost doubled since the start of the pandemic.

Figures from the Free Legal Advice Centres (Flacs) and Community Law and Mediation (CLM) indicate a surge in the number of people concerned their employers have treated them illegally during the lockdown.

The CLM, which runs two community law centres, in Dublin and Limerick, has seen a 196 per cent increase in consultations since March on employment law – including breaches of contract, unequal treatment and difficulty accessing payments – compared with the same period last year.

Rose Wall, CLM chief executive, said the organisation had increased its usual four clinics a week to 11, by phone, in response to calls from workers.

Flac, which provides clinics across the State, said employment law queries accounted for 10 per cent of its calls in April 2019 but this doubled to 20 per cent last month.

In March it had 126 calls to its phone-in clinics about workers’ rights, rising to 180 in April.

Among its cases were: a woman who was asked to go on maternity leave early; people with underlying health conditions being told they must return to work despite their concerns for their own health; people being told to take paid annual leave, when they needed it for future commitments; and people being asked to resign as they could not work from home due to childcare problems.

Other cases involved people having their pay reduced while working from home or being told they must use their own phones and laptops while working from home, without recompense.

Other significant calls included women returning from work after maternity leave, or who were about to take such leave.

Other queries were from workers feeling their employers had not taken sufficient health and safety measures, including a man who was told he had to travel for several hours with colleagues in a van, with no personal protective equipment provided.

Ms Wall said while the impact of coronavirus on businesses was “unprecedented”, it could not be used as a time to be lax about employees’ rights.

“People are feeling overwhelmed and vulnerable to the added complexities that Covid-19 brings to the workforce. With the number of people unemployed or supported under the temporary wage subsidy scheme now at about 1.1million, it is becoming increasingly difficult to challenge discrimination or mistreatment in the workplace.”

Eilis Barry, chief executive of Flac, said callers were “extremely stressed”. Both organisations said the number of employment-related calls was likely to increase as more people returned, or hoped to return, to work.

This underlined “the acute need for the availability and accessibility of legal advice, advocacy and legal aid during a crisis,” said Ms Barry, reiterating her call for a reform of the civil legal aid system.

“We must protect our workers and ensure that legal aid is accessible to all,” she said.

Employment rights are not currently covered by the civil legal aid scheme.

CLM has written to political parties involved in government-formation talks calling for prioritisation of reform of the civil legal aid scheme, including that workers have access to legal aid and representation in the Workplace Relations Commission."|1
2020-06-02|"After two years of planning, Germany assumes the Europen Council’s rotating presidency in a month. Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, the only detail of its presidency plan to survive is the logo: an endless loop known as a “Möbius strip”. You can create one by taking a tape-like strip of material, giving one end a short twist and fusing both ends. What makes a Möbius strip interesting is how two lines, sent off in different sides and on opposite sides, eventually meet. For Germany this phenomenon reflects how, in the EU, 27 sovereign states’ divergent positions eventually converge.

Chancellor Angela Merkel will need something far stronger than Möbius strips to get her through to Christmas. Last week, with characteristically laconic understatement, she suggested the pandemic would require “considerable adjustment” to Germany’s EU presidency plans. German civil servants know that, culturally speaking, busking is not their speciality. But they are being led by a woman who, in her 15 years in power, has become the uncrowned queen of drive-by-sight politics.

The EU’s rolling schedule meant this was already going to be a crucial presidency, with deadlines looming on a final Brexit deal and agreement on the EU’s upcoming seven-year budget.

Covid-19 has now upended everything. But like epidemiologists grappling with the novel coronavirus, Dr Merkel, a physicist, treats politics as a long-term laboratory experiment: when new information comes in, the procedures are adapted, the experiment is adjusted and run again.

With an eye on her political legacy, Dr Merkel hopes to use the common Covid-19 thread of crisis to draw together EU challenges new and old – economics, health, migration, climate and rule of law – to make a major integration push.

As Merkel’s fourth and final term enters its last year, Europe’s longest-serving leader faces an Olympian test of her eye for detail, her nose for negotiation and her ear for compromise. In this time of crisis, as the limits and potential of politics are being recalibrated, the EU can draw one last time on Europe’s safest pair of hands."|0
2020-06-02|"The Nevada State Athletic Commission approved the UFC for two events in Las Vegas during a meeting that was held via phone on Wednesday, May 27. The approval of those events, the first of which took place on Saturday, came with an NSAC mandated COVID-19 protocol document. The requirements of that document were more stringent than those the UFC used — and had difficulty following — in Jacksonville for three events earlier in May. The NSAC seems happy with what it saw from the promotion on Saturday at the UFC Apex.

“The 5/30 UFC event was held in accordance with NSAC protocols and the UFC’s Operational Plan which was approved by the NSAC. The event was extremely successful. The UFC went to great lengths and expenses to ensure all personnel were in compliance with COVID-19 precautionary measures and were in compliance with all regulatory and governmental requirements for a closed system event,” the NSAC told Bloody Elbow.

Some major upgrades in the NSAC COVID-19 protocol document:
• Utilization of a “closed system” for the events
• Documented protocol for entering and exiting the closed system
• Documented protocol for reacting to a positive COVID-19 test, which includes two weeks quarantine in Nevada
• Discipline for those who do not adhere to NSAC COVID-19 protocol
• Post-fight interviews did not take place face to face

The UFC didn’t do the best job enforcing the protocols it wrote for the Jacksonville events. The success in Las Vegas should make fighters and others involved with upcoming Las Vegas events feel more confident about the upcoming UFC 250 and other fights that will take place at UFC Apex.

Bloody Elbow asked the UFC which protocol it will follow for any events scheduled for “Fight Island.” The UFC did not respond before publication."|0
2020-06-02|"Worries about the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant mothers and their offspring are wide-spread. As a comparison, the Spanish Flu pandemic had devastating health impacts on pregnant mothers and in-utero exposure to influenza is known to have negative short- and long-term consequences for children. This column, however, argues that the existing evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic allows for cautious optimism about the impacts of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their children.

More than 2.5 million women are currently pregnant in the United States, and many are worried about the impact a COVID-19 infection might have on mothers and the development of their unborn children. A large literature surrounding the foetal origins hypothesis has shown that pregnancy conditions not only impact the mother but can also impair the offspring (Almond and Currie 2011). Maternal influenza infections during pregnancy may induce premature birth (Currie and Schwandt 2013) and strong cases may even impair foetal development to the point where repercussions throughout adulthood are observed (Schwandt 2019). In his seminal paper, Almond (2006) documented lower incomes and higher adult disability rates among the entire cohort of infants that was in-utero during the Spanish Flu pandemic.

What about children born during the COVID-19 pandemic?

While at this moment it is still unclear whether maternal COVID-19 infections impair foetal development, the existing evidence allows for cautious optimism. The rate of reported COVID-19 deaths among pregnant mothers is low (Hantoushzadeh et al. 2020) and while infections occur in pregnant mothers, most are mild or remain asymptomatic (Sutton et al. 2020, Luo and Yin 2020). Children of mothers infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy are born without detectable impairments and typically test negative for the virus (Chen et al. 2020; Yu et al. 2020).

However, it is too early to know whether in-utero exposure to COVID-19 has negative long-term consequences that are not immediately visible at birth. A potential reference point is the Spanish Flu pandemic (Aassve et al. 2020, Benmelech and Frydman 2020). However, it is important to keep in mind that the 1918 influenza virus had a very different, more devastating impact – particularly for pregnant mothers. Figure 1 compares the age profile of COVID-19 mortality in New York City with Spanish Flu mortality in Philadelphia, one of the hardest hit cities during the Spanish Flu pandemic (Markel et al. 2007). Both mortality rates are shown per 100,000 people, but are plotted on different y-axes since COVID-19 deaths rates are likely to continue increasing in the ongoing pandemic.

Figure 1 COVID-19 mortality (in NYC) and Spanish Flu mortality (in Philadelphia) by age and gender

Notes: Data on COVID-19 death counts for New York City, 1 February 2020-20 May 2020 (CDC 2020), combined with population estimates for 2017 (NYSDH 2017). Data on Spanish Flu mortality from Rogers (1920).

COVID-19 mortality increases exponentially with age, with extremely low death rates among infants, children, and young adults (these numbers include recent cases of multi-system inflammatory syndrome, Schroeder 2020). Mortality is particularly low for young women. Among a total of 16,493 COVID-19 deaths in New York City (between 1 February 2020 and 20 May 2020), not a single female fatality occurred below age 25. For women between the ages of 25 and 34, only five out of every 100,000 have died —and this figure is far lower than the rate for women 65 or older, where the data show more than 740 deaths per 100,000.

For the Spanish Flu, the age profile of deaths looked dramatically different. Fatalities were highly concentrated among infants and young adults. Among women, the majority of deaths occurred in the fertile age range and mortality was especially high among pregnant women (Almond 2006). For every death, there were many cases of severe illness, with recorded stillbirths more than doubling during the pandemic (Rogers 1920).

In other words, pregnant mothers who survived the Spanish Flu experienced extreme levels of sickness in response to influenza infections during the pandemic. This strong impact could not be more different from the current experience with COVID-19 infections, which often go largely unnoticed in pregnant mothers. This brings us to the last question in assessing the relative risks between the two pandemics for a developing fetus:

Are mothers’ mild responses to COVID-19 infections good or bad for an infant in utero?

Strong maternal reactions observed for influenza infections may drain the mother’s body, but they could be an efficient response, e.g. to protect the fetus from contracting the virus itself.

However, it turns out that the fetus does not usually get infected if the pregnant mother contracts an influenza virus or the COVID-19 virus (i.e. the virus does not pass the placenta). Hence, it is the strong maternal response to the influenza virus that impairs foetal development. A strong immune system response of the mother can lead to broad inflammations in the pregnant body (McDade 2012) which fight not only the virus but also damage healthy tissue such as the placenta. Pregnant womens’ mild immune system response to COVID-19 is, therefore, a hopeful sign.

Strong inflammations are also hypothesized to turn the mother’s immune system itself against the fetus. The father’s genes in the fetus are foreign to the mother’s body and are only tolerated due to the mediation of helper cells surrounding the placenta (Trowsdale and Betz 2006). A strong inflammatory response can compromise the functionality of these helper cells. As a result, the fetus might not only suffer from the inflammation itself, but an inflammation can actually cause the mother’s immune system to harm the fetus. It remains unclear why pregnancy makes women respond so strongly to the influenza virus (Kay et al. 2014), but it has been observed both for pandemics and seasonal influenza. Further, the resulting infections have similar negative impacts on the offspring – both at birth as well as into adulthood (Almond 2006, Creanga et al. 2009, Currie and Schwandt 2013, Schwandt 2019).

It is important to emphasize that our understanding of the threats of COVID-19 is still far from complete. We are learning from new research findings on a daily basis. But there is room for cautious optimism from what we know so far: COVID-19 seems to impact pregnant women less than influenza does. While immune system responses triggered by maternal influenza have been shown to impair foetal development, COVID-19 does not seem to cause such strong responses in mothers’ immune systems. Of course, it is still possible that other impairments in the offspring may appear later, even if they are not observable at birth. And only time will tell whether infants exposed to COVID-19 during the first or second trimester will show signs of impairment at birth. But, so far, the existing evidence allows for cautious hope that pregnant mothers and their offspring will fare much better during COVID-19 than they did during the last devastating global pandemic at the turn of the 20th century.

This is not to say that pregnant mothers and young children are entirely unaffected by the current pandemic. Food insecurity is on the rise (Schanzenbach and Pitts 2020), and many young families face financial stress as unemployment is soaring to unprecedented levels (Conti 2020). Nutritional, economic, and psychological stress during pregnancy is detrimental for the fetus as it increases the risk of poor health at birth which may in turn lead to negative long-term consequences (Aizer et al. 2016 Almond et al. 2011, Persson and Rossin-Slater 2018). Hence, we do not want to add unfounded anxieties about COVID-19 infections to mothers’ list of worries—as fewer worries might help their developing infants most.

2020-06-02|"H tend to be recession-proof. People always need haircuts. During the financial crisis of 2007-09 the number of hairdressers in America even rose. For Sylvia, who owns a small salon in Amsterdam, that crisis was very different from today’s. “Lockdown came out of nowhere and I had no buffer.” She is heartened that regulars phoned in when she reopened. “If it had lasted any longer”, she says, fighting back tears while disinfecting the previous customer’s seat, “I would have gone under.”

Women have borne the brunt of the economic disruption caused by the pandemic. In America, despite making up less than half of the workforce, they accounted for 55% of jobs lost in April. In Britain mothers are one-and-a-half times as likely as fathers to have lost or quit their jobs during lockdown, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies ( ), a think-tank.

The unevenness reflects the fact that women are more likely to work in services that require interacting with people. But hotels and shops have shut, and the work cannot be done from home. And crèches and schools have closed, leading some women to stop work and others to work less, in order to look after their children. If job and productivity losses persist, they could reverse progress towards gender equality in the workplace.

Today’s picture is in stark contrast to past recessions (see chart). Men are usually worse affected, because they dominate sectors such as manufacturing and construction, which tend to be badly hit. Matthias Doepke of Northwestern University and Michele Tertilt of the University of Mannheim estimate that three-quarters of all cyclical employment fluctuations in 1989-2014 were owing to men losing and gaining jobs. Women, by contrast, have acted as stabilisers. Employment in services, which is female-dominated, tends to be less volatile. And wives take up work or increase their hours when husbands lose jobs.

This time, though, industries involving face-to-face interaction, such as hospitality, have suffered most. In America health care and education have not been spared, with five times as many women losing their jobs as men. Firms run by women are also concentrated in customer-facing areas, which is why female small-business founders are much more likely than men to expect a drop in sales owing to covid-19, according to a survey by Nicholas Bloom and Robert Fletcher of Stanford University. Whether the hit to so-called “pink” sectors persists depends on whether customers flock back as restrictions are lifted. Structural shifts could well mean fewer air hostesses or event organisers, for instance. Temporary lay-offs could become permanent as firms go bust. (The pink crisis could also turn purple: in Canada, job losses in “blue” sectors seem to be catching up.) Sex segregation alone cannot explain why women have been hit hardest, though. Even after controlling for it, women in Britain were 15% more likely to have lost their job and 8% more likely to have been furloughed, according to research led by Abi Adams-Prassl of Oxford University. Possible explanations include discrimination, or that, bereft of child care, some mothers chose to leave their jobs. Higher-skilled women are less likely to lose their jobs than lower-skilled ones. Many are juggling working from home with child care. British households with young children are doing an extra 40 hours of care and schooling a week, find Almudena Sevilla of University College London and Sarah Smith of the University of Bristol. Mums do two-thirds of this, on average.

The gradual emergence from lockdowns could do particular harm to women’s careers, worries Claudia Goldin of Harvard University. With workplaces reopening before crèches fully do, couples could be forced to decide who returns to work and who minds the kids. The lower earner, often the woman, might stay home.

Meanwhile, mothers working at home are 50% more likely to be interrupted than fathers, according to the . This “Mu-u-um” pattern, evident even when the woman is the higher earner, could harm pay and promotions. “I fear we’ll see the impact in two to three years’ time in a widening gender pay gap,” says Vera Troeger of Warwick University. Academia offers a glimpse of what may come. Several journals report fewer submissions by women during the pandemic; male submissions to some journals have picked up.

The pandemic has, at least, made remote working normal. Before it, only one in 50 Americans worked from home full-time. By April, more than one in three did. With the concept tested, says Mr Bloom, “we’re never going back to the old world.” That would be good news for mothers, who tend to pick jobs that fit around their children, with more forgiving hours and shorter commutes. But it will mainly benefit university graduates, whose jobs are easier to do from home. Less-educated women cannot count on such a silver lining. A loss of employer demand and extra child-care duties make their job prospects bleaker. ■"|1

This column reports on a firm-level analysis across 16 emerging markets, and three Western European comparator countries, in order to gauge the potential risks associated with debt-driven COVID-19 support. The overall goal is to prevent a wave of bankruptcies that could break valuable relationships between firms and their suppliers and employees. However, liquidity support in the form of additional bank lending may create debt-overhang problems in the future and therefore requires careful targeting.

Over the past decade, corporate leverage has increased considerably in many developing countries and emerging markets, often exacerbating financial fragility (Alfaro et al. 2019). Policymakers who aim to alleviate corporate cash shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic therefore need to avoid overloading financially vulnerable firms with more debt. This risk is real given that the most popular method of COVID-19 support to SMEs has been to provide these firms with more loans. To gauge the potential risks associated with debt-driven COVID-19 support, this column reports on a firm-level analysis across 16 emerging markets, and three Western European comparator countries. Our objective is to understand where ‘small and medium-sized enterprises’ (SMEs) are most in need of cash and liquidity and, second, where these firms still have room on their balance sheet to take on more debt. Where there is little or no such room, further bank lending may come at the risk of a structural weakening of banks’ balance sheets (Galí 2020).

Our analysis is based on a firm-level dataset that combines information from surveys conducted as part of the latest round of the EBRD-EIB-World Bank Enterprise Surveys (with data from Orbis). We use these data to estimate regression models of firms’ optimal capital structure or leverage (defined as formal debt to total assets) and, separately, their cash holdings (defined as cash and cash equivalents to total assets). The models clarify how firms’ pre-COVID-19 capital structures and cash buffers can be explained by basic firm characteristics such as their size, profitability, asset tangibility, turnover variability, and industry.

Using these simple models, we then calculate for each country how much the average small business’s cash buffer falls short of (or exceeds) the predicted cash buffer. Likewise, we measure the available capacity for additional debt of the average SME (firms with 250 or fewer employees) in each country. Figure 1 summarises these calculations. The horizontal axis shows how SME cash holdings in countries such as Croatia, Lithuania, Morocco, Serbia, Slovenia, and Ukraine fall short of the predicted value by between 3-7% of total assets. In contrast, the average small business in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Latvia, Montenegro, and Slovak Republic has greater than predicted cash buffers.

Figure 1 Excess leverage and cash holdings of the average small business

The vertical axis of figure 1 shows where small firms (on average) still have the capacity to borrow more. For instance, this is the case in countries like Lithuania, Morocco, and Ukraine (countries where SMEs seem to have an urgent need for more liquidity), as well as in Bulgaria, Montenegro, and Slovak Republic (countries with excess cash). In contrast, in countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Slovenia (as well as Portugal,) there appears to be (on average) little room for more debt. It should be noted that even the average SME in many of these countries appears to have had limited liquidity buffers at the time pandemic first broke out.

Next, using the same models, we calculate for each country the proportion of SMEs that operate with lower than predicted cash buffers as well as the proportion of SMEs that entered the COVID-19 pandemic with relatively ample cash reserves. Likewise, for each country we calculate the proportion of SMEs that had little room for additional debt, and the proportion of SMEs that still appear in a position to absorb more debt. Figure 2 summarises these results. More than 60% of SMEs in Morocco and Ukraine are both short on cash and have room to take on extra debt. In contrast, we again see high shares of small businesses in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, and Slovenia that are short on cash but are already highly leveraged. Estonia and Poland are similar in that about a third of all SMEs are short on cash but already have borrowed a lot.

Figure 2 Distribution of small businesses by pre-Covid-19 debt and cash structure

How long can small businesses survive with their existing cash buffers? As a rough indicator, we calculate the number of months that a small business can afford to pay its employees out of its existing cash reserves. We then plot the distribution of businesses by different ‘survival horizons’ in Chart 3. About half of all small businesses in Ukraine have cash reserves of less than one month’s wages. Only around 20% of Ukrainian SMEs have the liquidity to pay more than six months’ wages. Similarly, most small businesses in Montenegro, Russia, Lithuania, and Slovenia were likely to run out of cash reserves to pay their workers in less than two months.

Where can credit access relieve liquidity constraints the most? Figure 3 also shows how the share of small businesses with liquidity constraints would change were they to ‘load up’ on debt to a level that our model would predict is normal (given their other firm characteristics). This shows, for instance, that additional lending to Ukrainian SMEs could decrease the share of businesses with cash buffers that only cover up to one month of wages from 50% to 20%.

Our empirical analysis is rudimentary in the sense that it disregards certain firm- and country-specific determinants of corporate debt and cash buffers. Notwithstanding, the analysis provides a straightforward and micro-founded ‘traffic light system’. This can help diagnose in which countries firms’ needs for liquidity are most dire, and (as importantly) in which countries these temporary cash shortages can safely be alleviated through more debt funding. For instance, in countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Slovenia, there appear to be a relatively large number of firms in need of liquidity but there are also many firms that are already highly indebted. In such countries, efforts to support cash-strapped firms may take the following into consideration:
• Decisions about whether to alleviate cash shortages through additional bank lending should ideally continue to be based on a case-by-case assessment of individual firms’ debt capacity. This in turn requires a view on whether the business was performing well before the pandemic, or already had issues. Business exit remains an essential part of the process of creative destruction.
• Where possible, lending programs should require participating banks to make full use of existing credit bureaus and registries to ensure a complete picture of total outstanding debt. This holds in particular for emerging markets with a history of episodes of excessive private sector borrowing, and where information sharing among lenders has proven beneficial (De Haas et al. 2020).
• In countries where few firms have spare debt capacity, SMEs may be better served by government-sponsored initiatives to roll over existing debt rather than to provide fresh debt. This may include temporary debt moratoriums and loan-maturity extensions.
• On a structural level, many emerging markets will need to gradually rebalance their financial systems towards a greater use of equity instruments and a reduced reliance on debt (EBRD 2015). In the short term, interesting proposals have been made for a European Pandemic Equity Fund (Boot et al. 2020). Such a fund would provide cash-strapped SMEs with cash flow injections in return for, for instance, a surcharge on future corporate tax payments. In the medium term, governments and (multi-)national development banks can play a proactive role in stimulating a public and private equity culture in emerging markets (for instance through improving research coverage and hence transparency of listed SMEs). As part of the COVID-19 response, financial resilience can further be rebuilt by selective equity investments in financially sound, high-growth, and innovative small businesses with strong management already in place. Lastly, in the long run, policy makers could structurally reduce tax-code favouritism towards debt (for instance, by giving firms equivalent tax benefits for equity and debt).

2020-06-03|"On 31 May 2020, WHO received information that between 18 and 30 May, four deaths were reported from the same quarter (quartier Air Congo) in Mbandaka Health Zone, Mbandaka city, Equateur Province, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. All cases had experienced fever and bleeding prior to their deaths. Of the four patients who died, two of them visited the General Reference Hospital (HGR) in Wangata; a sample (swab) was taken from one of them who died on 30 May. Safe and dignified burials were not performed for these four patients.

On 31 May, the brother of the probable case who died on 22 May and his wife presented to HGR Wangata; both had fever, non-bloody diarrhoea and vomiting. They were placed in isolation after blood samples were collected.

The three samples including two blood samples and a swab, were analyzed at a laboratory in Mbandaka where all three samples tested positive for Ebola virus disease (EVD) by GeneXpert Ebola assay. One of the three samples (swab) was sent on 31 May 2020, to the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) in Kinshasa and tested positive for Zaire Ebolavirus using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

As of 2 June 2020, eight epidemiologically-linked cases, including two confirmed alive cases, two suspected cases and four deaths (one confirmed and three probable deaths), have been reported. The Ministry of Health (MOH) officially declared the outbreak in Equateur Province on 1 June 2020.

Equateur Province experienced an EVD outbreak with 54 cases and 33 deaths, reported between 8 May 2018 through 24 July 2018. This is the eleventh outbreak of EVD reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the virus was discovered in 1976.

In the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak, the health capacity and resources in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are already strained and causing additional burdens on the national health system. The risk of disruption to surveillance and routine public health activities due to COVID-19 might jeopardize the country’s ability to rapidly contain re-emergence of these EVD cases. As of 2 June 2020, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has reported 3 194 COVID-19 cases and 71 deaths.

WHO, with the MOH, are implementing a coordinated rapid response to stop the spread of the outbreak, and to identify any other suspect cases and initiate contact tracing. In-depth epidemiological investigation and contact tracing were initiated on 31 May 2020.

The MOH, with support from WHO and partners have planned the following actions:

The laboratory capacity in Mbandaka is being assessed and support is on-going for appropriate set-up and additional supplies. Safe and dignified burial activities could resume shortly following proper community engagement. Support for case management is also important to ensure provision of care to affected individuals.

WHO did not receive adequate EVD funding since the start of 2020, and is currently using its emergency funds to support the epidemiological and public health interventions. Financial and human resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, WHO, and partners are challenged by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.

WHO notes that the current resurgence is undesirable, but not unexpected given the identification of wildlife spillover potential in Africa, accompanied by the high population density in the region and considering the sociological, ecological, and environmental drivers that could influence the emergence of EVD.

There is a need for: epidemiologists to conduct disease surveillance; infection prevention and control (IPC) specialists; vaccinators; case management and laboratory staff; and, risk communication and community engagement experts. Materials for infection prevention and control (IPC) and personal protective equipment (PPE), cold-chain, reagents for laboratory diagnostics, and means of transportation are required for the teams.

The area where the cases and deaths were reported, is populated with poor and vulnerable populations, known to be reluctant to social mobilization. This might pose further challenges in terms of case investigation, contact tracing, safe and dignified burials, and vaccination in the coming days.

Additional challenges have been identified regarding:
• further investigations into this event to understand the extent of the outbreak;
• contact identification and tracing, and identification of suspected cases;
• the COVID-19 context including lockdowns and non-availability of flights.

The investigations are ongoing to assess the full extent of the outbreak and therefore high vigilance should be maintained. This information will help define the risk in the coming days.

WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce Ebola virus disease transmission in humans:
• Reducing the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission from contact with infected fruit bats or monkeys/apes and the consumption of their raw meat. Animals should be handled with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing. Animal products (blood and meat) should be thoroughly cooked before consumption.
• Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission from direct or close contact with people with Ebola symptoms, particularly with their bodily fluids. Gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients at home. Regular hand washing is required after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after taking care of patients at home.
• Reducing the risk of possible sexual transmission, based on further analysis of ongoing research and consideration by the WHO Advisory Group on the Ebola Virus Disease Response, WHO recommends that male survivors of EVD practice safe sex and hygiene for 12 months from onset of symptoms or until their semen tests negative twice for Ebola virus. Contact with body fluids should be avoided and washing with soap and water is recommended. WHO does not recommend isolation of male or female convalescent patients whose blood has been tested negative for Ebola virus.
• Continue training and re-training of health work force for early detection, isolation and treatment of EVD cases.

WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information.

2020-06-03|"As if our 2020 wasn’t challenging enough, we are now confronted by another crisis that we must address. We are all feeling a lot of pain, anger, frustration, sadness and yes, fear. Especially because, with respect to race relations in the U.S., the progress feels both significant and still not enough at the same time. Nobody needs to be told how to properly treat another human being, and that’s not going to happen here – clearly racism and the killing by police of George Floyd, among others, similarly over time, are unacceptable to us. We stand by all peaceful protesters of these senseless events, and we are anxious for justice to be served, properly and swiftly!

DigitalOcean’s values start with community and end with love. We are expanding our Hub for Good program to support nonprofits, projects, and startups that are actively fighting for a range of causes that include reducing inequalities, promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, and productive employment for all.

When we initially launched Hub for Good in April, the program was designed to support relief efforts during the height of COVID-19. We are proud to have received over 1,000 applications to date, helped launch almost 600 projects, and have donated over $150,000 in infrastructure. Hub for Good started as a space where our community came together to build and share projects and resources with missions centered around COVID-19 relief efforts.

Now, we are broadening, indefinitely, our Hub for Good program to assist with other challenges our community is facing and, based on the extension, will commit up to $500,000 in infrastructure credits. We stand for equality and justice and want to donate our infrastructure to help our community build solutions to help the world better address both.

We are proud to support those who are making a difference and inspiring even more action. We hope you’ll join us in our mission to uplift our community, bring us all closer together, and make the positive impact on our world that we need so urgently now.

We’re in the process of making these changes to the Hub for Good page. Stay tuned to learn more about these updates, and how to get involved and spread the word.

Stay strong and stay safe and, most importantly, stay focused on the good we all can do!"|2
2020-06-03|- This is a really tough time for a lot of business owners. When you've put months or years into your business and now suddenly something threatens that business, it can feel demoralizing. But during times like this, you can't control external circumstances. All you can control is how you respond. So start by asking yourself what has changed, but also what hasn't changed? It's likely that your customers' core needs haven't changed, so if they're not coming to you, if they're not buying from you, identify what they're doing differently. That can help you plan a path forward for your business. My name is Jay Clouse. I'm the founder of Unreal Collective, a community of small business owners just like you. Over the last several weeks, I've had a front row seat to how dozens of business owners are reacting and adapting to the challenges of COVID-19. It's really hard for them. It's really hard for me, and I'm sure it's really hard for you too. But I want you to know that you're not powerless. You can react and adapt, and I want to help you do just that.|2
2020-06-03|"COVID-19 has laid bare the weaknesses of clinical diagnostics infrastructures. Underfunded, undervalued and underprepared, laboratory testing has been overwhelmed by the contagion. A combination of low reimbursement, low margins, low capacity and low investment has stifled innovation and competition. Cost-cutting, centralization and regulatory rigidity have created backlogs and slowed the tracking of infections. Given the pivotal role of diagnostics in healthcare decision-making, COVID-19 shows just how much clinical testing needs a radical rethink.

On May 28, the United States achieved a record 416,664 tests for SARS-CoV-2 in one day (around one test per thousand people per day). The United Kingdom, France, Spain and much of the rest of Europe are testing at a similar level. Given that only ~3,000 tests are carried out per day during a typical flu season, we are approaching the limit of testing capacity using existing clinical laboratories and supply chains. But it is nowhere near the level needed for countries to contain COVID-19 while reopening their economies.

According to the World Health Organization, if more than 10% of results come back positive, testing capacity is insufficient; test positivity higher than 10% means many active infections are being missed. Nobel laureate economist Paul Romer has suggested 30 million daily tests are needed to reach the 10% positivity threshold in the United States. The Rockefeller Foundation Testing Action Plan projects 5 million tests by early June, growing to 20 million in the following four months. Even the lowest estimates suggest 750,000 to 900,000 molecular tests will be needed every day — more than double what is presently available.

The massive scale of testing now needed is a result of government failure at the beginning of the outbreak to quickly implement testing, tracking and tracing measures — together with social distancing — to limit the community spread of SARS-CoV-2. In those countries where lockdown was decisive and stringent tracking and tracing procedures were put in place — Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore — subsequent massive testing has been unnecessary.

Elsewhere, failed lockdowns and slipshod testing have gone hand in hand. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control botched its test rollout and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dithered on Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs), vacillating between oversight that was too stringent for RT-PCR testing and too lax for serological testing. The United Kingdom abandoned broad testing and contact tracing in March, then reversed its policy. France planned widespread testing at the end of March, then gave up on diagnostic testing when it became clear its clinical testing infrastructure couldn’t deliver.

The shrinking number of public labs, along with their centralization, has meant results can take days if not weeks to come back — useless for tracking and tracing. France has only 45 testing labs; the United States just 97 public labs, with a commercial sector dominated by corporate giants like Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp. Germany stands apart, with a robust infrastructure of 20 national reference centers, around 40 ‘consultant laboratories’ and hundreds of hospital- and clinic-based local testing centers. Results from the extended network are coordinated through a computer system adapted from Germany’s Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance network; Heidelberg even has a ‘corona taxi’ program that transports medics in protective gear to check on patients in their homes.

In contrast, testing in the United States is a mess. With shambolic coordination at the national level, existing providers have become swamped, testing backlogs have lengthened and shortages of swabs, supplies and reagents have grown. As traditional labs failed to ramp up, several research centers and hubs have stepped in and retooled to provide semi-automated ‘pop up’ labs for COVID-19, working with regulatory authorities and partnering with clinically accredited labs to innovate around reagent shortages. One open-source effort recently won an FDA EUA for processing >10,000 samples per day using automated loop-mediated isothermal amplification, circumventing RT-PCR reagent shortages and aiming to provide results in 24 hours. Another idea is to use multiplexing schemes and next-generation sequencing to pool thousands of bar-coded COVID-19 samples and then triage down to confirmatory testing for the identification of individual positives — an approach that enabled Wuhan, China to test 6.5 million people in 9 days.

Whatever technology is adopted, with tests in such short supply, strategic deployment to hotspots will be important in combination with contact tracing: clinical centers, essential services, travel hubs, nursing homes, meat-packing plants and places of congregation (bars, nightclubs or religious gatherings) will remain priorities, with drive-thru testing provided as an adjunct.

During reopening, testing volume will most likely be built by employers. Symptom reporting and contact-tracing apps built on Apple and Google’s API will be used to identify workers to prioritize for testing (Drexel University and Baylor College already offer such an app). Ultimately, kits for doctors’ offices and at-home testing will become available, some perhaps even using CRISPR technology, like those from Mammoth Biosciences or Sherlock Biosciences.

The failure of the clinical diagnostic sector to deal with the demands of a 21st century pandemic is a wake-up call. The traditional players appear incapable of innovating around the problem — probably because innovation is alien in an environment where reimbursement cuts by the 2014 Protecting Access to Medicare Act, erosion of intellectual property protection, and a lack of regulatory clarity has depressed profit margins and stunted investment.

But infectious disease is not going away. And in an increasingly interconnected, urbanized and globalized world, COVID-19 has shown that present lab testing systems are clearly unfit for purpose. A reinvigoration of new ideas and new technology is urgently needed to put diagnostics back at the forefront of twenty-first-century medicine and pandemic prevention."|1
2020-06-04|"Jonathan Cotliar knew he was ahead of the curve four years ago when he joined Science 37, a company that supports virtual clinical trials conducted mostly online. The firm in Los Angeles, California, was growing slowly before March, receiving about a dozen calls a week from potential clients. But since the COVID-19 pandemic began, Science 37 has been running at fever pitch.

Cotliar, the company’s chief medical officer, says Science 37 now receives hundreds of enquiries every week from potential clients, such as pharmaceutical companies, medical centres and even individual investigators. With hospitals forming the epicentres of COVID-19 outbreaks around the world, clinical-trial participants have become reluctant to attend routine check-ups and monitoring, and health-care workers are stretched beyond their capacity. This has caused researchers to put many clinical trials on hold or to shift to a virtual trial structure by performing consultations online and collecting as much paperwork and data as possible remotely.

The pandemic might hasten the kind of change in clinical trials that Cotliar and Science 37 were hoping to make anyway. And there could be other lasting effects on drug development: companies that are usually competitors are now collaborating, and many are trying to make their supply chains more robust to deal with disruption. Some researchers and companies in the drug-development field say the system might never be the same again.

The pandemic has touched nearly all aspects of the industry, says Kenneth Kaitin, director of the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development in Boston, Massachusetts. “This has really turned upside down the whole drug-development process,” he says. “The entire investigative world is focused just on developing treatments for COVID-19.”

Scientists’ worlds will shrink in the wake of the pandemic

Some changes are likely to be temporary, Kaitin predicts. Drug regulators in the United States and other countries have acted fast to approve clinical trials of therapies and allow new uses of existing medicines to fight COVID-19, without demanding as much data and paperwork as they normally would. Such changes are likely to stick only for as long as the outbreak lasts. “The flexibilities that are being granted for clinical-trial development are being granted under the auspices of a public-health declaration,” says Esther Krofah, executive director of FasterCures, a Washington DC think tank. “That, to me, is very much an emergency operation.”

And Kaitin points out that these changes shave only a few months off the drug-development timeline — crucial in the middle of a pandemic, but unlikely to make a significant dent in the lengthy process of developing a therapy, which can stretch out over years.

The pandemic could catalyse lasting change in other ways. What might linger, Krofah says, is the culture of collaboration across government, industry and academia that has emerged during the outbreak. “We have traditional competitors working together in new ways,” she says. An alliance of more than a dozen companies — including Gilead in Foster City, California, Novartis in Basel, Switzerland, and WuXi AppTec in Shanghai, China — has been working to discover and test antiviral treatments by sharing data about early results and basic science, as well as collaborating on designs for clinical trials. If these group efforts bear fruit, they might continue, says Krofah.

Pharmaceutical companies might also make long-lasting adjustments to their supply chains, says David Simchi-Levi, who studies operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Over the past few decades, drug makers have increasingly shifted their manufacturing away from the United States and Europe to countries such as India and China, which can produce the drugs at lower cost. But over the past few years, many firms have begun to look for ways to diversify their supplies of services and raw materials, to reduce the risk of supply interruptions in the event of a US–China trade war, says Simchi-Levi. The coronavirus outbreak could accelerate that trend. “Some shocks were anticipated, but not at this scale,” says Krofah. “This is going to cause a fundamental re-examination of that risk.”

Momentum for a shift towards virtual clinical trials has been gradually building for years. But progress had been hindered by a lack of clear guidance from regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a reluctance to invest in the technology needed to run such trials — until the pandemic hit, says Cotliar. Companies such as Science 37 are suddenly seeing their popularity skyrocket. “It’s exponentially accelerated the adoption curve of what we were already doing,” Cotliar says. “That’s been a bit surreal.”

At the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, for example, infectious-disease specialist David Boulware and his colleagues conducted a randomized, controlled, virtual trial of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to find out whether it can protect people who are at high risk of contracting COVID-19. The trial, which included more than 800 people and found the treatment had no benefit (D. R. Boulware et al. N. Engl. J. Med. http://doi.org/dxkv; 2020), sent participants medicine by FedEx delivery and monitored their health remotely.

Patient advocates have long pushed for more virtual trials, which ease the burden of clinical-trial participation. If the trend catches on, it could speed up the enrolment of participants — a significant piece of the drug-development timeline.

And now that the pandemic has driven medical centres to set up much-needed technology, and forced the FDA to release guidelines for virtual trials during the pandemic, it is hard to imagine clinical research going back to the way it was before, says Krofah. “We’re going to see this as a new, normal part of clinical research,” she says. “The cat is out of the bag.”"|0
2020-06-04|"In mid-March, just after restrictions were put in place to slow the spread COVID-19, Dr Nigel Stevenson looked out the window of his Dublin apartment. “It was a beautiful, still evening, the sun was setting and there was no traffic on the roads. It was idyllic,” he recalls. “Then I remembered why it was so quiet, and I thought... that damn virus.”

Stevenson, who leads the Viral Immunology Lab in Trinity’s Biomedical Sciences Institute, knows more about “that damn virus” than most. For more than a decade he has been working on disease-causing viruses, including HIV, Hepatitis C and, more recently, the coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 (from the outbreak in the early 2000s) and MERS (from the outbreak in 2012). Now he has turned his lab’s attention to the pandemic virus, SARS-CoV-2.

His interest? The biochemical dance between an invading virus and the human cell it seeks to hijack, and how understanding those interactions could help us design new therapies to stop infection.

“Some viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, can hide from our immune systems early in the infection, and they can really get entrenched,” he explains. “By understanding how they do that, we could potentially bring the viruses out of hiding and help the immune system to clear the infection early on. That would lead to less disease.”

When the SARS-CoV-2 virus – that causes Covid-19 – gets into our airways, it enters our cells and ejects its genetic material, co-opting the infected cell into making copies of the virus, which then go on to infect other cells.

One way our body defends us against this takeover is by releasing a substance called interferon, Stevenson explains. “Interferon is a really powerful defender, because it activates hundreds of other genes and proteins that effectively stop the virus in its tracks.”

But some viruses can interfere with the interferon response. Stevenson and his Trinity College Dublin colleague Prof Cliona O’Farrelly have previously shown the Hepatitis C virus can block a particular pathway of biochemical signals inside the cell, thereby stopping the cell from “telling” interferon to ramp up the molecular defences. “We could see that the virus degraded this biochemical pathway inside liver and immune cells,” explains Stevenson. “And this blockade meant the body wasn’t able to switch on its normal defences against the virus.”

Stevenson has found other viruses use a similar mechanism to block responses to interferon, among them HIV. “We have been able to show that HIV-1 stops interferon too,” he says. “And we are looking at ways to prevent HIV-1 from doing that, and thereby restore the natural interferon response.”

Then, last year, in a case of spectacularly good timing, PhD student, Yamei Zhang, in Stevenson’s lab started to look at the effect of the original SARS and MERS coronaviruses on the Interferon response. “Our ongoing studies are showing that both the SARS-1 and MERS viruses use a conserved mechanism to block interferon,” Stevenson adds.

When Covid-19 became a serious public health concern, the researchers also turned their attention to SARS-CoV-2. Their analysis of the pandemic virus genome indicates that it too may use this process to suppress response to interferon, as it has a similar interferon-blocking code to the one Stevenson’s lab has studied in its coronavirus “cousins”.

“We are now studying this, because if this is one way through which SARS-CoV-2 evades our immune system, then it’s good news for our battle against this deadly virus,” says Stevenson. “Our lab is already working on ways to restore interferon’s biochemical pathway, so now we can apply these research discoveries to the pandemic virus too.”

Another difficulty in Covid-19 is that when the immune system does respond to the virus later in the infection, it can over-respond in some people, damaging their lungs and other organs. Prof Andrew Bowie, also at Trinity, is trying to figure out the pathway to this response.

Like Stevenson, he has found himself in a good position to focus on SARS-CoV-2. “Last year, we started working with RNA viruses that affect the airways, trying to understand how these viruses trigger an immune response in lung cells,” Bowie says. “And now we can pivot that work to look at how the RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 does this.”

Bowie, along with O’Farrelly and Prof Luke O’Neill, are part of a European project called INITIATE, which explores how disease-causing viruses interact with human cells growing in the lab.

“We are looking at how the airway cells react to the viruses when they meet them, and the kind of inflammatory immune response that follows,” explains Bowie. “We and others have already discovered that viruses prompt a different kind of immune response in lung cells compared to the response we see to bacteria. Now we can look at how the inflammatory immune response gets switched on specifically in response to SARS-CoV-2, and what pathways are involved. It’s a good example of how answering a basic biological question will shed light about what is going on in patients who experience this kind of immune activation in Covid-19.”

Ultimately, we want the answers to those biological questions to translate into better ways to prevent or treat Covid-19. Dr Virginie Gautier at University College Dublin is marshalling her lab’s resources to screen for such answers. Her expertise lies in host-virus interactions, and now she has re-oriented her lab to look at SARS-CoV-2.

“We are interested in the ways that cells respond biochemically to viruses, so that we can identify points of vulnerability that could be targeted by drugs,” explains Gautier, who is a principal investigator at the UCD Centre for Experimental Pathogen Host Research. “We also have a platform set up in the lab where we can apply specific drugs or other agents and see how that affects the virus when infecting the cells.”

With funding through the Health Research Board’s national Covid-19 rapid response call, Gautier is now working with UCD Prof Paddy Mallon to screen for ways to block SARS-CoV-2 using that platform.

“We want to look at drugs that have already been approved for use in the clinic, so they could be repurposed for treating SARS-CoV-2 if they are effective, and we are looking at potential new agents against the virus too,” Gautier says.

Her lab is also helping to provide reagents for hospitals to test patient samples for SARS-CoV-2, she adds. “This pandemic needs us all to work together, to use the insights and systems we have developed for other viruses and focus on this one.”"|0
2020-06-04|"The UK’s 2008 Climate Change Act has led to a 34% fall in CO 2 emissions by 2019, while real GDP per capita had risen by more than 10% following the crash into the ‘Great Recession’. Can the UK achieve its recent net-zero emissions target by 2050 while still growing? This column describes some speculative routes to such a decarbonised future.

Although much of the modern world is powered by fossil fuels, that was not an inevitable outcome of technology and costs. The first electricity generator in the UK in 1868 was hydro-driven, the first commercial photovoltaic solar panel – building on Edmond Becquerel’s 1839 creation of the first photovoltaic cell – was developed by Charles Fritts in 1881, the first wind turbine to generate electricity was built by James Blyth in 1887, and by the 1930s wind-generated electricity was relatively common on US farms. Moreover, electric cars date back to the 1880s after Thomas Parker built a vehicle with a high-capacity rechargeable battery. Thus, an all-electric-powered society is just going back to a future where we might have been 125 years ago.

The rapidly falling costs of renewable energy sources like solar cells and onshore wind turbines combined with improved storage methods should substantially reduce oil and gas use in electricity production. Offshore wind turbines have also fallen greatly in cost and increased in efficiency over the past two decades so that for the UK they offer a low-cost alternative with the incidental benefit of creating marine reserves and fish sanctuaries. Wind turbines are cheaper than natural gas combined-cycle turbines even before adding the costs of carbon capture and storage.

Solar photovoltaics come next (for the UK) if carbon capture and storage is enforced, though both wind and sun sources require large backup electricity storage systems for, for example, windless nights, which we’ll discuss below. Renewable energy’s share of overall UK electricity generation reached a peak of 60.5% at one stage in April 2020, according to National Grid data.

Coal use has fallen to near zero in the UK since the 2008 Climate Change Act, without obvious aggregate costs (Hendry 2020). However, natural gas usage has increased 3.5-fold since the mid-1980s and still contributes about 140 megatons (Mt) p.a. to CO emissions despite producing less than half those of coal per Btu.

In 2019, the UK government amended the original Climate Change Act target to zero net emissions by 2050. All sources of greenhouse gas emissions must go to a level such that carbon capture and storage, possibly combined with atmospheric CO extraction methods, must remove the rest.

Facing an irreducible non-zero minimum demand for oil and gas (e.g. for chemicals), to achieve zero net emissions before 2050 requires major technological change that almost certainly involves developing current research on avenues to remove (Wemyss 2014) or reuse existing CO as a fuel (Stanford University 2019). ‘Net zero’ is an excellent target but incredibly difficult to achieve and as yet, there is no sensible UK strategy to do so – so we now suggest some speculative routes.

To meet the net-zero target, natural gas–use must be reduced to near zero, like coal. Natural gas is mainly used for electricity production and household indoor- and water heating. The former could be handled in part by increased renewable sources. Household natural-gas (and some oil) usage could be reduced by increased taxes encouraging the adoption of solar panels and, for example, air heat pumps.

More radically, the UK could switch back from a national gas distribution system using natural gas to one based on hydrogen, possibly made by electrolysis when there is spare renewable electricity. The UK had a hydrogen-based gas distribution system prior to 1969, but the switch to natural gas required all household equipment to be converted from ones that burned coal gas (which is composed of about 50% hydrogen) to those that burned natural gas (which is mainly methane).

With ever-improving technologies and cost reductions in renewable electricity generation, a near-zero target for natural gas over the next 30 years should be possible without reducing GDP growth – perhaps even increasing growth with new opportunities.

However, as no future technology is certain, more research should be devoted to developing safe small modular nuclear reactors (World Nuclear Association 2020) based on the well-developed nuclear-powered engines in submarines. Variants of small modular nuclear reactors such as molten-salt waste-burners https://www.seaborg.co/ may be able to use non-fissionable thorium or the ‘spent’ uranium fuel rods from older reactors, helping to reduce the serious problem of transuranic-waste disposal. Part of those disposal-cost savings should be put towards the building of small modular nuclear reactors, perhaps supplemented by reallocating the £40 billion saved by abandoning the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station.

Even over our horizon of 30 years, nuclear fusion seems unlikely to be a key energy contributor despite many developments, such as increasing output efficiency (Bennett 2017) and reducing internal damage to tokamak materials from helium (Galeon 2017), which might then be collected, offsetting a potential shortage.

Reducing oil use in transport to zero will take longer following current strategies, even with more efficient engines (diesel being phased out completely given its toxic pollutants), and much higher taxes on gasoline. Without a major improvement in lithium-ion-battery-powered electric vehicles, their relatively short journey capacity despite taking a non-negligible time to recharge discourages the replacement of internal combustion engines.

However, recent advances have been made in understanding the properties of graphene, with potentially large falls in its cost of production (see ‘graphene in a flash’ from plastic waste, Williams 2020). Graphene nanotubes can act as electrode super-capacitors, and there may be something like a variant of Moore’s law (which states that processing power of computers doubles every two years) that could lead to cost reductions stemming from a large increase in their production.

Imagine sandwiching an array of graphene nanotubes (Sammed et al. 2020) between two Faraday cages in a prefabricated modular unit fitted to a vehicle’s roof (perhaps even retrofitted on existing car roofs) to power an electric motor, so the vehicle becomes the battery. Graphene nanotubes seem capable of rapid charging and should be able to sustain viable distances on a single charge.

Moreover, if such electric vehicles are successful, mandating them to be plugged in when not in use will translate into a vast electric storage system for no additional investment, with cars acting as the National Grid’s storage. Thus, renewable sources of electricity could be widely adopted without worrying about the security of supply.

There are undoubtedly many technical issues that need to be solved before such a system could work in practice, but there is much going on – such as developing 2-dimensional tri-layers of graphene (Graphene-info 2020) as an insulator, superconductor, and magnet.

Several steps are possible for the UK to rapidly advance research on GNTs: (1) offer EPSRC significant additional funding for a general call to research the topic; (2) approach Manchester University directly as a world leader in graphene research with two Nobel Laureates; (3) offer a world-wide prize of £10m+ for the first car to successfully meet appropriate criteria, with the patent to the UK Government; (4) contact major UK motor manufacturers of electric vehicles for interest and support; (5) make the call more general as other light materials could play equivalent roles as sources of electricity. Other steps include research on smart meters to be able to register both payments for taking power from fast chargers, and recording kwhs withdrawn from the grid and needing replaced for free; and contemplating a grid of fast chargers.

The potential benefits of such a power source would be huge as a ‘sensitive intervention point’ (Farmer et al. 2019 cite the UK’s Climate Change Act of 2008 as a timely example with a large effect).

By not demonising road transport for its CO footprint and dangerous pollution, cars with internal combustion engines could be replaced at a rate matching obsolescence and the increased need for storage from the extension of renewables. The basics of electric engines are established, so employment can be maintained in vehicle manufacture and many of its ancillary industries rebased on graphene nanotubes. Two side benefits are a major reduction in both mining for lithium and later disposal or recycling of the resulting toxic battery waste; and eliminating the need for expensive catalytic converters, markedly cutting production costs, eliminating a target for theft (which then exacerbates air pollution), and reducing palladium mining.

Indirect consequences could solve the UK rail system’s problem of a lack of electrification across much of the network, by replacing diesel-electric trains with graphene-nanotube-supplied electric ones, although some progress is also being made with hydrogen-driven trains in Germany and the UK (University of Birmingham, n.d.). As graphene nanotubes are so light, they could stimulate a large increase in economical electric-powered aircraft (Travierso 2013).

Agriculture, construction, chemical industry, and waste management look more problematic, although there have been some improvements in efficiency. Inner-city underground (Frangoul 2018) and vertical farms (Despommier 2009) economise on water, fertiliser, and energy – partly from transport reductions – and are increasingly viable given the falls in costs of LED lighting.

There is research on altering farm-mammal diets to reduce methane emissions, including adding dietary fumaric acid (from plants like lichen and Ic"|0
2020-06-04|"The health costs of the Covid-19 pandemic are considerable, and the economic and social costs of lockdown policies are even larger. This column calls for an innovative mechanism to foster the development of a vaccine against Covid-19. Governments would commit now to buy back any patent obtained by a private firm which would discover an effective vaccine, at a price of €60 billion, and would grant the right to produce the vaccine to any firm able to do so. This mechanism would provide strong incentives to innovate, while protecting firms from the political risk of expropriation.

On 4 May 2020, a pledging conference convened by the EU raised €7.4 billion in funding for Covid-19 vaccines, treatment, and diagnostic research. Leading funders included the European Commission, Germany, France, the UK, the World Bank, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation – even the pop singer Madonna.

As of 15 May, the Covid-19 pandemic has caused more than 300,000 deaths throughout the world. This pandemic may be the first major global event in the history of humankind: all countries are hit, and within each country, entire populations are affected negatively by the pandemic itself, or potentially positively by public interventions to fight against its diffusion.

For locked-down countries, production losses have been estimated at 30% of usual activity (OECD 2020). EU countries pledged to donate €4 billion, but each week of lockdown may cost €60 billion in foregone production. Some countries which have begun to soften their lockdown policies may have to reimpose strict measures, at tremendous economic cost.

Beyond the direct healthcare costs of the pandemic and the human costs of deaths and suffering, the main economic consequences are not due to the virus itself, but to policies aimed at flattening the curve. In April 2020, half the world population was confined in some way.

According to the OECD (2020), the direct costs are already enormous: the EU27 may have lost at least €280 billion in foregone production in the first month of lockdown. Baldwin et al. (2020) and Gourinchas (2020) observe the GDP loss could be tremendous if this lockdown triggers a full-scale recession.

One major issue with ending policies of containment is that we don't know if they will need to be reactivated in the near future. Successful lockdowns bring new infections to zero in a population, but with a low share of individuals who have gained immunity. In Europe this share ranges from 0.4% in Norway to 9.8% in Italy (Flaxman et al. 2020). This possibly underestimates true immunity, but herd immunity requires levels of 50% to 66%.

There is a significant probability that new imported cases will trigger new epidemic waves in Europe. And so epidemiologists argue that suppression strategies will need to be maintained until vaccines or effective treatments become available (Walker et al. 2020). Even currently undefined (and controversial) policies that would seek to balance containment with the need to restart and maintain economic production may still induce substantial production losses.

Such policies could be avoided if a vaccine were available and could be produced in large quantities. Early economic epidemiology papers have shown that complete eradication is very difficult to attain (e.g. Geoffard and Philipson 1996), but many infectious diseases are kept under control today through vaccination. If a sufficiently large proportion of the population is vaccinated, we potentially achieve herd immunity by this route. Even if a vaccine fails to eradicate Covid-19, it will be a major tool to reduce prevalence.

The economic gains from the rapid creation and manufacture of a vaccine have been noticed by investment fund managers. The Financial Times reported on 24 April that BlackRock, Fidelity International, Aviva Investors, Janus Henderson and Amundi all wanted drug companies to collaborate with their competitors to speed up its availability.

According to Le et al. (2020) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, 115 vaccine candidates were in development on 8 April, although even in the most optimistic case, this development will take more than a year. Researchers and their employers may be motivated by the desire to contribute to human wellbeing – but money may be important too, if only because it allows innovators to throw more people and resources at the research. Those financial incentives to innovate are generally determined by the expectation of a temporary patent monopoly.

Though the 4 May conference was indeed a great success, the total amount pledged so far still represents only a small fraction of the economic costs induced by the pandemic. Though a substantial share of that amount will be targeted towards vaccine research, this research is also sensitive to the political risk of expropriation.

An example: one week after the conference, Paul Hudson, CEO of Sanofi, said that the subsidy granted by the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to finance its vaccine research programme came with a commitment by Sanofi to give priority for a vaccine to US customers. In response, French authorities and members of the European Parliament countered that any vaccine would have to be equitably available to all. Many MEPs went further and expressed support for compulsory licensing of any vaccine.

Vaccine research takes time and resources, and is a risky enterprise. The chance is high that even if a vaccine is discovered by a pharmaceutical firm, political pressures will prevent this firm from making profits by the usual route of obtaining a patent and selling the vaccine at a high price.

For a Covid-19 vaccine, the social and political pressures for an exception to patent protection will be considerable. It is hard to believe that some, if not most, countries will not invoke Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement, enabling a government to use compulsory licensing to allow a local firm to produce a patented product without the consent of the patent owner, or to import the product from another country.

Under TRIPS, governments must still pay an 'adequate' fee to the patent holder. But if the emergency is extremely urgent, they don't need to try to agree a voluntary license. In short, a government can impose its own price.

It's a safe bet that Covid-19 satisfies these conditions and so, for a private firm, the risk of expropriation seems particularly important. Even if governments do not activate compulsory licensing, political pressures and healthcare budget constraints mean that firms will be under pressure to lower prices.

Many major pharmaceutical companies are already dedicating risky research efforts to find a vaccine against Covid-19, reducing investment in other drugs or vaccines. But these hold-up risks may reduce their effort. Stockholders may gripe if there's a risk that a firm will succeed but not be granted a patent, or that it gets a patent but is unable to recoup R&D spend.

Kremer et al. (2020) and Athey et al. (2020) have argued for advanced market commitment. This was intended to foster research on diseases common in developing countries, but it could apply here. Donors pledge to top up payments for newly introduced vaccine meeting technical benchmarks, conditional on the firm’s setting the price close to marginal cost. Three pneumococcal vaccines have been developed encouraged by such a pledge and 150 million children in poor countries have been immunised, saving an estimated 700,000 lives.

But, if production costs are difficult to observe, the commitment to sell at marginal cost is impossible to verify. This generates a political risk: NGOs campaigning for lower drugs prices and transparency in price-setting would put pressure on any patent-holder to reduce prices, even those claiming to sell at production cost.

A more standard way to come close to marginal cost pricing is to rely on competition between producers. However, since competition brings profits to zero, financial incentives for research must come from another instrument.

One way to get around these issues while providing incentives for vaccine research would be for donors to pledge to buy the patent at a high value. They would then allow private firms to produce the vaccine without having to pay any patent fees. The patent would have high value, but it can be thought as a way to front-load the costs that would be borne in future by health insurance schemes, which in European countries are mostly funded by payroll taxes – revenues from which have already been severely damaged by the drop in economic activity (Baker 2020). If pledged by the EU, such a commitment would also speed up the availability of the vaccine, as the producer will not have to negotiate a price in each country.

Governments could even set up such a scheme as an option offered to pharmaceutical firms. The patent holder could still decide to remain the owner of the patent and to negotiate market access, and prices, with each healthcare financing institution.

This could be financed by the Recovery Fund announced by the European Commission which, according to the European Parliament, could be as large as €2 trillion. A commitment by the EU to buy a vaccine patent would be a clear and transparent mechanism that would reduce the political risk of expropriation, could foster investment in R&D, and will speed up market access.

We could argue that an investment that could hasten the end of containment by just one week in Europe would be socially profitable if it costs less than €60 billion This amount provides a lower bound for the social value of a vaccine.

A commitment to buy for, say, €60 billion seems an enormous sum; but if this shortens a future lockdown by a single week, it would be an efficient use of public money.

2020-06-04|"Log on to Twitter for a masterclass in gall. What claims to be the account of Iran’s supreme leader shows his concern for America’s downtrodden. The Turkish president is “deeply saddened” at their lives under an “unjust order”. As for China, one official opts merely to quote the late George Floyd. “I can’t breathe,” said the man whose death after police arrest has set off US-wide protests.

America’s internal schisms are being used against it, and used well, with the soft touch and irony that autocrats are meant to lack. But then there is so much to work with.

The dividedness of the US – racial, material, political – is aired thoroughly enough as a domestic blight. It is the effect on its foreign policy that can get lost in the anguish. If the US is riven, it must also be hampered in its outward actions. And nowhere will it suffer more than in the superpower duel.

The US-China rift is so cheaply likened to the cold war that we forget how much more unified America was back then. When it took on the Soviets, it was fresh from the bonding trauma of the second World War. Republicans and Democrats did not just have bipartisan manners, but shared policies: a mixed economy, anti-isolationism, foot-dragging on civil rights.

Immigration had been too low for too long to test the country’s sense of itself. Trust in government was so high as to implicate Americans in Old World deference. The distribution of incomes was much flatter than it is now. Politics rarely spilled on to the street.

With all the due caveats about silent tensions (and, in McCarthyism, loud ones), the US that set out on the cold war was a nation of almost quaint togetherness. It could be mobilised for an open-ended contest against a far-off rival.

Achieving the same trick now would tax a Lincoln or a Roosevelt. It is not just a week’s urban unrest that has to be overcome, but two or three decades of calcified partisanship. If another cold war is afoot, the US goes into it with less of the cohesion that primed it for the first. The best it can hope is that the causal link runs the other way: that an external foe is what brings citizens together. If so, the process is slow in working.

As they consider the inflamed streets, Americans of some vintage will shiver with memories of the late-1960s. It is important to follow that thought a bit further. What the turmoil over civil rights and the Vietnam war ultimately brought was a change in world affairs: the cold-war breather we know as detente.

The US saw that it could not tussle with the Soviets while its own house was in such disrepair. It had to sue, if not for peace then for a modus vivendi, at least until it felt robust again. Foreign policy could not endlessly buck domestic weakness.

Nor can it now. If anything, the US is even less cohesive in 2020. Detente-era Washington was still a bipartisan place, with Republicans renouncing their own president, Richard Nixon, and some supreme court judges being confirmed near-unanimously. It is now a pit of bad faith. Nor was income inequality such a sore point before the market reforms of the 1980s. It is now entangled with the race question and the Covid-19 pandemic.

For reasons of pride or strategy, confronting China might be still be right. But it matters that it coincides with the most fractured time in national life for half a century. The least to be said is that those who will the confrontation should not stoke the disunity.

And so to the president. Donald Trump did not etch the faultlines into his society, but he picks at them with rare abandon. We know well enough that he will not desist out of good conscience. Much odder is that he rejects the geopolitical case for doing so.

If he wants the US to bed down for an indefinite struggle against China, he must know that it cannot also be so nakedly at odds with itself. The president can have discord at home, or he can have a tenable showdown abroad. It is ever harder to see how he can have both. A true hawk would be sweetly emollient in domestic politics.

Instead, the president touts a bible (unconvincingly) and pledges to get rough (convincingly). Protesters are dispersed not far from the White House. In Washington, the ambient sound comes from vigilant helicopters. The past week is said to have been Trump’s most divisive yet. As such, it was also the worst for his foreign goals. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020"|1

Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB,

Frankfurt am Main, 4 June 2020

Jump to the transcript of the questions and answers

Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.

Incoming information confirms that the euro area economy is experiencing an unprecedented contraction. There has been an abrupt drop in economic activity as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the measures to contain it. Severe job and income losses and exceptionally elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook have led to a significant fall in consumer spending and investment. While survey data and real-time indicators for economic activity have shown some signs of a bottoming-out alongside the gradual easing of the containment measures, the improvement has so far been tepid compared with the speed at which the indicators plummeted in the preceding two months. The June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections see growth declining at an unprecedented pace in the second quarter of this year, before rebounding again in the second half, crucially helped by the sizeable support from fiscal and monetary policy. Nonetheless, the projections entail a substantial downward revision to both the level of economic activity and the inflation outlook over the whole projection horizon, though the baseline is surrounded by an exceptional degree of uncertainty. While headline inflation is suppressed by lower energy prices, price pressures are expected to remain subdued on account of the sharp decline in real GDP and the associated significant increase in economic slack.

In line with its mandate, the Governing Council is determined to ensure the necessary degree of monetary accommodation and a smooth transmission of monetary policy across sectors and countries. Accordingly, we decided on a set of monetary policy measures to support the economy during its gradual reopening and to safeguard medium-term price stability.

First, the Governing Council decided to increase the envelope for the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) by €600 billion to a total of €1,350 billion. In response to the pandemic-related downward revision to inflation over the projection horizon, the PEPP expansion will further ease the general monetary policy stance, supporting funding conditions in the real economy, especially for businesses and households. The purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. This allows us to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy.

Second, we decided to extend the horizon for net purchases under the PEPP to at least the end of June 2021. In any case, we will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until the Governing Council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over.

Third, the Governing Council decided to reinvest the maturing principal payments from securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2022. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.

Fourth, net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion, together with the purchases under the additional €120 billion temporary envelope until the end of the year. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates.

Fifth, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.

Sixth, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.

Together with the substantial monetary policy stimulus already in place, today’s decisions will support liquidity and funding conditions in the economy, help to sustain the flow of credit to households and firms, and contribute to maintaining favourable financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions, in order to underpin the recovery of the economy from the coronavirus fallout. At the same time, in the current rapidly evolving economic environment, the Governing Council remains fully committed to doing everything necessary within its mandate to support all citizens of the euro area through this extremely challenging time. This applies first and foremost to our role in ensuring that our monetary policy is transmitted to all parts of the economy and to all jurisdictions in the pursuit of our price stability mandate. The Governing Council, therefore, continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.

Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The latest economic indicators and survey results confirm a sharp contraction of the euro area economy and rapidly deteriorating labour market conditions. The coronavirus pandemic and the necessary containment measures have severely affected both the manufacturing and services sectors, taking a toll on the productive capacity of the euro area economy and on domestic demand. In the first quarter of 2020, when containment measures were only in place from mid-March in most countries, euro area real GDP decreased by 3.8%, quarter on quarter. Information from surveys, high-frequency indicators and incoming hard data all point to a further significant contraction of real GDP in the second quarter. Most recent indicators suggest some bottoming-out of the downturn in May as parts of the economy gradually reopen. Accordingly, euro area activity is expected to rebound in the third quarter as the containment measures are eased further, supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a resumption in global activity, although the overall speed and scale of the rebound remains highly uncertain.

This assessment is also broadly reflected in the June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. In the baseline scenario of the projections, annual real GDP is expected to fall by 8.7% in 2020 and to rebound by 5.2% in 2021 and by 3.3% in 2022. Compared with the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised substantially downwards by 9.5 percentage points in 2020 and revised upwards by 3.9 percentage points in 2021 and 1.9 percentage points in 2022.

Given the exceptional uncertainty currently surrounding the outlook, the projections also include two alternative scenarios, which we will publish on our website following this press conference. In general, the extent of the contraction and the recovery will depend crucially on the duration and the effectiveness of the containment measures, the success of policies to mitigate the adverse impact on incomes and employment, and the extent to which supply capacity and domestic demand are permanently affected. Overall, the Governing Council sees the balance of risks around the baseline projection to the downside.

According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation decreased to 0.1% in May, down from 0.3% in April, mainly on account of lower energy price inflation. On the basis of current and futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline somewhat further over the coming months and to remain subdued until the end of the year. Over the medium term, weaker demand will put downward pressure on inflation, which will be only partially offset by upward pressures related to supply constraints. Market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have remained at depressed levels. While survey-based indicators of inflation expectations have declined over the short and medium term, longer-term expectations have been less affected.

This assessment is also reflected in the June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation in the baseline scenario at 0.3% in 2020, 0.8% in 2021 and 1.3% in 2022. Compared with the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP inflation has been revised downwards by 0.8 percentage points in 2020, 0.6 percentage points in 2021 and 0.3 percentage points in 2022.

Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth increased to 8.3% in April 2020, from 7.5% in March. Strong money growth reflects bank credit creation, which is driven to a large extent by the acute liquidity needs in the economy. Moreover, high economic uncertainty is triggering a shift towards money holdings for precautionary reasons. In this environment, the narrow monetary aggregate M1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth.

Developments in loans to the private sector continued to be shaped by the impact of the coronavirus on economic activity. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations rose further to 6.6% in April 2020, up from 5.5% in March, reflecting firms’ need to finance their ongoing expenditures and working capital in the "|0
2020-06-05|"Julian Assange​ was running WikiLeaks in 2010 when it released a vast hoard of US government documents revealing details of American political, military and diplomatic operations. With extracts published by the New York Times, the Guardian, Der Spiegel, Le Monde and El País, the archive provided deeper insight into the international workings of the US state than anything seen since Daniel Ellsberg gave the Pentagon Papers to the media in 1971. But today Ellsberg is celebrated as the patron saint of whistleblowers while Assange is locked in a cell in London’s Belmarsh maximum security prison for 23 and a half hours a day. In this latest phase of the American authorities’ ten-year pursuit of Assange, he is fighting extradition to the US. Court hearings to determine whether the extradition request will be granted have been delayed until September by the Covid-19 pandemic. In the US he faces one charge of computer hacking and 17 counts under the Espionage Act of 1917. If he is convicted, the result could be a prison sentence of 175 years.

I was in Kabul when I first heard about the WikiLeaks revelations, which confirmed much of what I and other reporters suspected, or knew but could not prove, about US activities in Afghanistan and Iraq. The trove was immense: some 251,287 diplomatic cables, more than 400,000 classified army reports from the Iraq War and 90,000 from the war in Afghanistan. Rereading these documents now I’m struck again by the constipated military-bureaucratic prose, with its sinister, dehumanising acronyms. Killing people is referred to as an EOF (‘Escalation of Force’), something that happened frequently at US military checkpoints when nervous US soldiers directed Iraqi drivers to stop or go with complex hand signals that nobody understood. What this could mean for Iraqis is illustrated by brief military reports such as the one headed ‘Escalation of Force by 3/8 NE Fallujah: I CIV KIA, 4 CIV WIA’. Decoded, it describes the moment when a woman in a car was killed and her husband and three daughters wounded at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Fallujah, forty miles west of Baghdad. The US marine on duty opened fire because he was ‘unable to determine the occupants of the vehicle due to the reflection of the sun coming off the windshield’. Another report marks the moment when US soldiers shot dead a man who was ‘creeping up behind their sniper position’, only to learn later that he was their own unit’s interpreter.

These reports are the small change of war. But collectively they convey its reality far better than even the most well-informed journalistic accounts. Those two shootings were a thousand times repeated, though the reports were rare in admitting that the victims were civilians. More usually, the dead were automatically identified as ‘terrorists’ caught in the act, regardless of evidence to the contrary. The most famous of the WikiLeaks discoveries concerned an event in Baghdad on 12 July 2007 during which the US military claimed to have killed a dozen terrorists. But the incident had been filmed by the gun camera of the US Apache helicopter that had carried out the shootings, and the people it targeted were all civilians. Much was known about the killings because among the dead were two local journalists working for Reuters. It was known, too, that such a video existed, but the Pentagon refused to release it despite a Freedom of Information Act request. Appalled by what the video revealed about the way the US was conducting its war on terror, and appalled by the contents of the thousands of reports and cables it was stored alongside, a junior US intelligence analyst called Bradley Manning, who later changed her legal gender and became Chelsea Manning, released the entire archive to WikiLeaks.

The video still has the power to shock. The two helicopter pilots exchange banter about the slaughter in the street below: ‘Ha, ha, I hit them,’ one says. ‘Oh yeah, look at those dead bastards,’ the other says. They have mistaken the camera held by one of the journalists for a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, unlikely though it was that armed insurgents would stand in the open in Baghdad with a US helicopter hovering overhead. They shoot again at the wounded as one of them, probably the Reuters assistant Saeed Chmagh, crawls towards a van that has stopped to rescue them. When the pilots are told over the radio that they have killed a number of Iraqi civilians and wounded two children, one of them says: ‘Well, it’s their fault for bringing their kids into the battle.’

The WikiLeaks documents exposed the way the US, as the world’s sole superpower, really conducted its wars – something that the military and political establishments saw as a blow to their credibility and legitimacy. There were some devastating revelations, the helicopter video among them, but many of the secrets uncovered weren’t particularly significant or indeed very secret. In themselves they don’t explain the degree of rage WikiLeaks provoked in the US government and its allies. This was a response to Assange’s assault on their monopoly control of sensitive state information, which they saw as an essential prop to their authority. Making such information public, as Assange and WikiLeaks had done, weaponised freedom of expression: if disclosures of this kind went unpunished and became the norm, it would radically shift the balance of power between government and society – and especially the media – in favour of the latter. It is the US government’s determination to defend its ongoing monopoly, rather than the supposed damage done by the release of the secrets themselves, that has motivated it to pursue Assange and to seek to discredit both him and WikiLeaks.

This campaign has been unrelenting and has had a fair measure of success, despite the fact that most of the charges made against Assange are demonstrably untrue. Regarding the release of documents, there were two lines of attack. First, Assange and WikiLeaks were accused of revealing information that endangered or led to the deaths of Americans or their allies in Iraq and Afghanistan. Second, they were accused of having injured the US state in general through activities amounting to espionage, which should be punished as such. Much more damaging to Assange, however, and to the whole WikiLeaks project, were the allegations of rape made against him in Sweden, also in 2010. This led to a prosecutorial investigation lasting nearly ten years, which was dropped three times and three times restarted before finally being abandoned last November as the statute of limitations approached, beyond which no charges could be brought.

The result is that Assange has become a pariah. Lost is the fact that he and WikiLeaks did what all journalists should do, which is to make important information available to the public, enabling people to make evidence-based judgments about the world around them and, in particular, about the actions of their governments. Given the constant drum beat of attacks on Assange from so many directions it can be hard to remember that in 2010 WikiLeaks won a great victory for freedom of expression and against state secrecy, and that the US government and its allies have made every effort to reverse it.

The early attempts to discredit Assange focused on trying to prove that the WikiLeaks disclosures had led directly to the deaths of US agents and informants. The Pentagon put a great deal of effort into substantiating this allegation: it set up an Information Review Task Force headed by a senior counterintelligence officer, Brigadier General Robert Carr, which studied the impact of the revelations and sought to produce a list of people who might have been killed because of the information the cables contained. Carr later described the extent of his task force’s failure, in testimony given at Manning’s sentencing hearing in July 2013. After long research, his team of 120 counterintelligence officers hadn’t been able to find a single person, among the thousands of American agents and secret sources in Afghanistan and Iraq, who could be shown to have died because of the disclosures. Carr told the court that at one point his task force seemed to be getting somewhere: the Taliban claimed to have killed a US informant identified in the WikiLeaks cables. It was a sign of desperation on the part of the counterintelligence officers that in seeking evidence against WikiLeaks they were reduced to citing the Taliban as a source. And, as Carr admitted during the defence cross-examination, the Taliban turned out to be lying: ‘The name of the individual killed was not in the [WikiLeaks] disclosures.’ Despite all this, the lawyer representing the US government at Assange’s extradition hearings in London earlier this year still argued that Assange had put the lives of US sources in Iraq and Afghanistan at risk.

In Kabul in 2010, just after my first look at the diplomatic cables WikiLeaks had released, I happened to be meeting an American official for an off the record talk about the situation in Afghanistan. I asked him for his thoughts on the cables; he replied by asking what classification code appeared at the top of the pages I’d seen. When I told him, he was dismissive about the degree to which the documents really contained deeply held secrets, classified though they may be. He explained that the US government wasn’t so naive as to believe that information stored on a database to which as many as half a million people had access – one of whom turned out to be Private Manning – was likely to stay confidential for very long. Known as Siprnet (Secret Internet Protocol Router Network), the database had originally been the sole property of the Pentagon but was used more widely in the aftermath of 9/11, when it became clear that parts of the US bureaucracy had valuable information that other parts didn’t know about. Siprnet was the answer to the problem of insufficient sharing: an ele"|1

Meet Peinaleopolynoe elvisi, a newly described species of species of deep-sea worm whose iridescent scales evoke glittery-jumpsuit-era musical icon Elvis Presley. Four such stunning species were collected from the bottom of the eastern Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and an area near Costa Rica, using a crewed research submarine and remotely operated vehicles. Researchers used DNA sequencing to place all four in the Peinaleopolynoe genus, a group of scale worms distantly related to earthworms.See more of the month’s sharpest science shots, selected by Nature’s photo team.

New technology platforms collected more data on the oceans in 2018 than was gathered during the entire twentieth century. This is the kind of real-time information that we need to protect our oceans and those who sail on them — but it is scattered, warn ten ocean scientists. They call for improvements in how we collect, share and access that data to power a global response to climate change, overfishing and pollution.

What it will take to save corals

Researchers are investigating last-resort conservation measures to help corals to adapt to hotter, more acidic oceans caused by climate change. For example, scientists in the Florida Keys are trying to maintain the reef system by hand-rearing coral samples that have survived the pollution and rising temperatures naturally. Expanding marine protected areas can help to buy time for these ‘underwater forests’ — and the wildlife and livelihoods that depend on them. But scientists emphasize that these innovations will not be enough unless global leaders support them with urgent action to slow the rate of global warming.

Since the early Space Age, researchers have studied what it would take for humans to survive long-term either in space or on another planet, and have even grown lettuce on the International Space Station and gotten a seed to sprout on the Moon. Experts — who often admit they look to science fiction for inspiration — say it will be crucial to save human excrement to use as fertilizer. “That’s your starter kit, what you need to get started in the soil,” says ecologist Wieger Wamelink. “Actually, The Martian is totally correct there.

2020-06-05|"Two weeks after a high-profile paper in The Lancet1 reported that the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine might be dangerous to patients with COVID-19, three of its four authors have retracted the work because they were unable to independently verify their data set, a large proprietary collection of electronic health records analysed by Surgisphere, a US company.

On the same day, 4 June, the researchers and other co-authors retracted a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)2, for the same reason. That study, published a month ago, had looked at the impact of certain heart medications on people with COVID-19, and found no safety concerns.

Scientists say the affair raises serious questions about the way researchers and journals evaluate the data underlying papers that they publish, and may complicate the effort to trial drugs during the coronavirus pandemic.

“This whole event is catastrophic — it is problematic for the journals involved, it is problematic for the integrity of science, it is problematic for medicine, and it is problematic for the notion of clinical trials and evidence generation,” says Ian Kerridge, a bioethicist at the University of Sydney, Australia.

Both papers relied on proprietary data analysed from electronic health records that were apparently gathered from hundreds of hospitals around the world by Surgisphere. But after critics raised questions about the studies, the firm did not make its raw data available to third-party auditors for validation. According to the retraction notice in the Lancet, Surgisphere was concerned that transferring the data would violate ""client agreements and confidentiality requirements"".

“Since we do not have the ability to verify the primary data or primary data source, I no longer have confidence in the origination and veracity of the data, nor the findings they have led to,” said Mandeep Mehra, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, who was the lead author on both studies.

Sapan Desai, the founder of Surgisphere, in Chicago, Illinois, and a co-author of the studies, declined to comment to Nature on the retractions and on concerns about the quality of the data behind the studies. Desai signed the NEJM retraction but not the Lancet one.

After the Lancet study appeared, some regulators had paused enrolment in clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. The drug, which is cheap and easy to administer, has been widely endorsed in the pandemic, including by US President Donald Trump, despite scant evidence of its effectiveness. Some of the halted trials, including one led by the World Health Organization, are now starting again. But researchers say they’ve lost time and that enthusiasm to take part in the trials may be waning.

A third study authored by Desai, Mehra and others that used Surgisphere data, which claimed to find a large reduction in COVID-19 mortality when patients were given the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin, has disappeared from the social-sciences preprint server SSRN, where it was first posted on 6 April; a second version was posted on 19 April. Mehra told Nature that he removed the study because he ""did not feel it was ready for peer review"".

Although the paper was not published in a peer-reviewed journal, it has nonetheless contributed to a surge in the popularity of ivermectin in South America, says Carlos Chaccour of the Barcelona Institute for Global Health in Spain, who is running a clinical trial of ivermectin and had raised questions about the preprint’s data.

Bioethicists say the retractions, and the pulled preprint, raise questions not only about the quality and nature of Surgisphere's data, but also about why the paper’s other authors agreed to work with a large data set they couldn’t validate, and how the work passed peer review at prestigious medical journals.

The hydroxychloroquine study, published on 22 May, had purportedly analysed electronic health records gathered on 96,000 patients in 671 hospitals across six continents. But critics soon raised questions about oddities in the data, and asked for more details on its origins. By 28 May, 120 researchers had signed a letter to The Lancet highlighting their concerns. The questions also cast doubt on the NEJM study, which relied on Surgisphere data that apparently covered almost 9,000 patients across 169 hospitals.

Mehra says he and other co-authors asked for an independent audit of the data in both papers from Medical Technology & Practice Patterns Institute (MTPPI), a health-care data research institute in Bethesda, Maryland. But on 3 June, Mehra says, MTPPI told them that Surgisphere would not share the data “because of agreements with its clients and the fact that the documents contain confidential information”. Mehra and his co-authors asked for retractions.

Before they published the studies, researchers and journals should have asked more questions about how so comprehensive a data set had been gathered from hospitals across the world in the middle of a pandemic, says Wendy Rogers, a bioethicist at Macquarie University in Sydney. “It is always easier with hindsight,” she says, “but in general with the COVID-19 research, there has been such a rush that all sorts of really abysmal papers are getting published.”

Researchers testing hydroxychloroquine in large clinical trials say they’re worried that the publicity around the Lancet findings may make it harder to complete their research, even though the paper has now been retracted. “We’re hearing that people just aren’t interested in hydroxychloroquine,” says David Smith, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Diego, who is helping to run a trial funded by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to test the drug in people with COVID-19 who have not been hospitalized. “The retraction won’t get anywhere near as much news as the original study,” he says. “We may never get an answer about treatment with hydroxychloroquine.”

Most data on hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 has come from in vitro studies or small clinical trials. On 5 June, however, researchers with a large randomized UK trial, called RECOVERY, announced that their data on more than 4,600 hospitalized patients indicated that hydroxychloroquine didn't reduce the risk of death, and they were stopping that arm of the trial. And a randomized, controlled study in 820 people reported on 3 June that the drug was not effective in preventing infection among people who were at high risk of infection following exposure to someone with COVID-193. In contrast to the retracted Lancet paper, the studies found no evidence of toxicity to the heart from hydroxychloroquine treatment.

Those findings don’t rule out possible benefits from hydroxychloroquine in other settings, says Joseph Cheriyan, a clinical pharmacologist at the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in the United Kingdom, where trials testing the drug were halted pending a safety review after the Lancet paper. (One has since resumed.) “The only way we’re going to know is if we do the trials, and what is frustrating is that this article has essentially delayed us,” he says.

It is not uncommon for studies that use large data sets to be published without external scrutiny of the raw data, says Smith. But an exception to this is when the paper is expected to have particularly high impact, as in the Lancet case. In this instance, he says, it appears that extra-careful review was skipped. “It’s a rush right now,” he says. “We are desperate for knowledge, and maybe we’re skipping over some of our tried-and-true checks.”

Both The Lancet and the NEJM said their peer review processes were confidential, and that they could not give details about how quickly the papers were reviewed. “The article had external peer review and statistical review, as well as scientific and manuscript editing. However, as we would do with any incident of this type, we are reviewing our procedures, including how we assess research analyzing large datasets based on electronic medical record data,"" said an NEJM spokesperson.

Surgisphere’s ivermectin preprint may have a longer life. The Peruvian government included the drug in its national treatment guidelines a few days after a white paper cited the SSRN preprint, Chaccour says, and a week after that, Bolivia added ivermectin to its treatment guidelines, citing the situation in Peru. Paraguay has issued restrictions on the sale of ivermectin because of high demand.

After Chaccour gave a talk about ivermectin to the Peruvian Academy of Sciences, streamed on Facebook, he says he gets texts almost every day from people saying that they have an infected family member and can obtain formulations of ivermectin intended for use in animals, not people. “They send me a photo of a veterinary formulation and ask me, ‘Would you mind telling me what dose we should use?’” he says. “It is broadly available and people are broadly desperate and this could lead to misuse.”

Because the two versions of the preprint were not published in a journal, there is no retraction mechanism to limit their long reach, Chaccour worries. “Who retracts this ivermectin ghost in Latin America?” he says. “There’s no high-profile journal saying this was wrong.”"|1
2020-06-05|"The Chief Executive Leadership Institute’s Mayors College and CEO Summit, long planned for June 3, went on as planned, but in a new format—an online discussion, open to the public—and with a new theme: racism and the civil unrest sweeping the United States after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police.

“I had to pivot in real time to address the—literally—burning social issues of the day,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, founder and CEO of the Chief Executive Leadership Institute.

 

 Several times a year, the CEO Summit brings together corporate and government leaders and leading academics to discuss the role of business in navigating the day’s most pressing issues; the annual Mayors College convenes mayors of middle-sized and large cities from both parties.

Both events are typically in-person, closed-door gatherings, allowing for frank discussion among high-profile leaders.

“We were about to cancel,” said Sonnenfeld, Yale SOM’s senior associate dean for leadership studies and the Lester Crown Professor in the Practice of Management, “but so many top leaders requested we continue, even without the usual intimate, off-the-record exchange, that we were encouraged to instead try it with remote technology.”

The summit’s original theme was “Economic Rejuvenation: Safely Bringing Corporations and Communities out of COVID Caves.” Organizers had prepared an agenda of discussion revolving around economic recovery, community rebuilding, biotech developments and U.S./China trade issues related to the COVID-19 crisis and breakdowns in diplomacy. But after Floyd’s death and the protests that followed, Sonnenfeld said, it was clear that a change in focus was needed.

“I worried about a ‘bait and switch’ charge with such a powerful, busy collection of leaders,” said Sonnenfeld “But they, too, are experiencing a sudden new priority and thankfully embraced the shift.”

Some of the opinion leaders and experts in attendance included 47th U.S. Vice President Joe Biden; Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont; U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer; Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit; 25th U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter; the 65th U.S. secretary of state, General Colin Powell; and former U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.

“This was a rare opportunity to have a cross-section of leaders, spanning industries, ideologies, and sectors, speak to the vital issues of the day,” said Sonnenfeld.

Summit attendees said they found the discussion deeply meaningful and helpful as they guide their organizations through turbulent times. Kay Koplovitz, the founder and former CEO of USA Network, called the meetings she attended Wednesday “extraordinary.” She added, “The challenges at hand were so well articulated by the mayors, regardless of political affiliation... same could be said for the CEO session.”

Tamara L. Lundgren, Chairman and CEO, Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc., wrote in a note to Sonnenfeld, “Both the mayors’ meeting and the CEO Summit were terrific and the topics discussed extraordinarily timely. Thank you for your leadership, deft touch, and ability to engage hundreds of people in a conversation and yet make it feel like a gathering of only a few.”

Nicole Russo, CEO and President of Microboard, commented that she believed the discussion at the event could help all the participants have meaningful impact in coming days. “I am committed personally and professionally to help drive the change our country needs. I look forward to staying in close contact with you and fellow CEOs on how we can collaborate to stabilize and propel our neighbors, businesses, and this great country to new heights.”

Among the cities represented by the mayors present were Lincoln, Nebraska; Atlanta, Georgia; Buffalo, New York; Louisville, Kentucky; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Hartford, Connecticut; Oakland, California; Miami, Florida; Tampa, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Stamford, Connecticut; and El Paso, Texas."|2
2020-06-05|"SAN FRANCISCO, June 4, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The first class action lawsuit was filed today on behalf of the more than 2,800 passengers negligently exposed to COVID-19 on the Princess Cruise Lines Grand Princess cruise from San Francisco to Mexico from February 11, 2020 through February 21, 2020. The law firms Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, LLP, Mary Alexander & Associates, and Nelson & Fraenkel, LLP filed the suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.

The complaint alleges that at least 100 passengers who traveled onboard the Grand Princess Mexico trip have tested positive for COVID-19, and two died after disembarking. One of these fatalities was, at the time, the first-reported death caused by COVID-19 in California. All told, Carnival cruises have reportedly been associated with more than 1,500 positive COVID-19 infections and nearly 40 deaths.

""Carnival and Princess allowed potentially infected individuals on the Mexico cruise to share confined space with other passengers, casually and callously exposing all 2,500 passengers to serious illness from COVID-19,"" said Lieff Cabraser partner Elizabeth Cabraser, who filed the lawsuit on behalf of the Plaintiffs.

As detailed in the complaint, before the Mexico cruise, Carnival and Princess became aware of an outbreak of COVID-19 aboard another of their cruise ships, the Diamond Princess, during cruises in Asia. Ten cases were originally diagnosed, and that number rapidly escalated to over 700 cases—over one-fifth of the passengers onboard—with 14 deaths.

On February 11, 2020, approximately ten days after Carnival and Princess learned about the infections aboard the Diamond Princess, the defendants boarded plaintiffs and approximately 2,500 other passengers onto the Grand Princess for a roundtrip voyage to Mexico without conducting any effective medical screenings for passengers and without providing any additional information about best practices to mitigate or prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The complaint alleges that on or around February 19, 2020, Carnival and Princess became aware of at least one passenger suffering from COVID-19 symptoms onboard the Grand Princess Mexico cruise, but they did not warn passengers aboard the ship, nor did they put into place any quarantine requirements, social distancing protocols, or meaningfully alter their on-ship protocols, event itineraries, or cleaning and disinfectant practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19. As alleged in the complaint, after Carnival and Princess became aware of the first case aboard the ship, they worked to ""keep the fun going"" by ""encouraging [guests] to mingle.""

While onboard the Grand Princess, Plaintiff Dwight Everett began to experience symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and chose to self-isolate in his cabin. After disembarking from the cruise and returning to his home, Mr. Everett tested positive for COVID-19. Plaintiff Connie Simmons also became extremely ill while aboard the cruise, and suffered from a fever. She contacted medical staff on the ship, but did not receive any response for three days. When a doctor finally visited her room, the doctor refused to enter.

""We are shocked and disappointed that Carnival and Princess endangered our family,"" said Plaintiff James Simmons, who traveled aboard the Grand Princess with his family, including his mother, Connie Simmons. ""We have been loyal customers for years and never imagined that Carnival and Princess would so carelessly put our health at risk.""

""Multiple passengers on the Grand Princess's Mexico trip suffered from COVID-19 symptoms while on the vessel,"" noted Mary Alexander, who also represents the plaintiffs in the case, ""exposing other passengers and crew members trapped on board the ship to the virus. This is categorically unacceptable.""

The lawsuit sets forth claims of negligence, gross negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and seeks injunctive as well as compensatory damages, including the implementation by Carnival and Princess of new and meaningful appropriate social distancing and communicable disease communication and disinfection protocols upon all cruise ships, as well as ongoing medical monitoring, diagnostics, and treatment for all infected class members.

2020-06-05|"I awake Saturday morning. Awaiting me is a team text from Shana about IG. I lie there, lamenting my lack of sleep. I rub my Quarantine Food Baby and think about Danielle’s upcoming postpartum post. I speak with Shana about said IG post. I check the news again, to see if the situation in America’s cities has gotten worse overnight. I do not want to face the day. I do not want to face my guilt or my sadness. It is all too heavy. I try to think about how we’ll get outside today (we’ve committed to going outside five days out of seven during quarantine) — without putting ourselves in potential danger of a protest that could potentially get out of hand. You can imagine how selfish this feels.

I move to the living room for my morning yoga. I watch the line of the cars on the highway. I know in my gut these cars are coming to Center City to attend the protest I am going to skip. I begin to think about my response. I watch as the city’s police force, in their cars with their bicycles attached, head into Center City to get into place for the protest I have decided we are not attending.

I had struggled through a day of “wrong responses” on Friday. First, Mr. Trump’s inflammatory response to the nation’s protests (the looting and shooting one). “Wrong response,” I thought. Then I listened, appalled, as columnist David Brooks gave another “wrong response” when Brian Lehrer asked him to put the President’s tweet into the context of his previous days’ column “If We Had A Real Leader”. Instead of condemning the president’s call for violence against protestors and looters, Brooks buried the idea in a lament about us living under the barrage of Mr. Trump’s Twitt-ocracy over the past three years. He said maybe it’s a complicated response, because he doesn’t condone rioting. He — clearly — could not bring himself to condemn the president’s call for violence. This seemingly insignificant moment overshadowed — and dare I say ignited — my mood of overwhelming sadness for an entire weekend. This glaringly incorrect response to a people’s suffering and its leader’s failure.

During our team catch-up Friday, when prompted by Syd, Shana said she would write her weekend post about “something light.” She said she has just written about Ahmaud Arbery’s death and that nothing changes. Disappointing response, I thought.

I had an afternoon check-in with A. I was sad. I needed to regroup. We re-grouped. We spoke of Woke Sadness. Maybe we’d do a Facebook Live for TME on Woke Sadness. S checked in. She’d written a post. She had sat down and gotten angry and written. I love when S does that.

As I do yoga, my mind is cinematic. I had scrolled through the AP and NY Times apps the night before, as I have done nightly since we’ve been in quarantine, and looked at all the pictures of chaos coming out of America’s cities. I do not have a TV for this reason. My mind is visual enough. Living in a pandemic has given any obsessive or compulsive anxieties new life. My amygdala is already working overtime.

I watch my mind as I do yoga. It explores my own response — or lack thereof.

Is it the images — the ones my mind is stuck on — of people — officers and protestors, their faces within inches of each other — yelling, my mind translating this as a transmission of COVID-19 — that is keeping me from protesting today?

I mean…anyone who has been hospitalized as a COVID-19 patient, and had no test or inconclusive test results, has no interest in being hospitalized for COVID-19, and therefore, quite frankly, no interest in being near other people.

The nonchalance of Derek Chauvin, smug and calm, spread around social media…I don’t need to watch the video. I finally learned that in 2016, after years of traumatizing myself by doing so every summer (Michael Brown, Freddie Gray, Philando Castille). Of course, it took someone else to point out that people of color viewing so much violence against other people of color can be traumatizing. It is.

Perhaps it is because I am no longer an expat? I attended plenty of protests in 2016 and 2017 with Goose in tow — from Standing Rock to the Women’s March and the Healthcare March — and even in 2018. Even though I returned to the U.S. in 2014, I still considered myself an expat for a number of years. As an expat, I had power. I had power, because for the six years I lived overseas, I got to be an American. Just an American. Nationality, ethnicity, religion…yes, I had to answer some of those questions and check those boxes—but for both nationality and ethnicity, I could simply write U.S.A or North American. I didn’t have to go through the mental minefield and jungle of arguments to determine whether to choose “Black,” “African-American”, Native American”, “White”, “Multiracial,” “Other,” … “Should I choose one, or check all that mathematically apply? America’s history is complex. Being African-American is complex.” “Is there a benefit to one over the other on this particular form?” “Will it work against me to declare my “race”? “Why are they asking for a race? Race is a social construct and we should stop giving it power.” So by the time I returned to the U.S., I felt human. I felt strong and independent and socio-economically invincible…even if I was broke.

I’ve done this before!! I’ve grabbed my bike, strapped my 4- then 5-year-old daughter in for protests so she could learn social justice the way other young warriors have. I was not worried back then – Obama too, had made me American with his notion of a shared narrative.

Philly for 20 years has successfully and peacefully protested, and I have experienced that. Granted, I learned to get there on time and leave when it was officially over (usually because it was a weeknight, and we had to have dinner and get ready for bed), but I showed up. I showed up — and with Goose.

Of course my fears — because that’s what they are, anxiety running amok in the midst of America’s Crisis of Violence in the midst of a Global Pandemic — are not about The Protest. And my reasons for staying home are not about not wanting to protest.

My fears? Are of a police system on steroids.

The militarization of American police departments — if you remember that exploration in 2014 after the riots in Ferguson — is one of the greatest fears I live with. It has only become amplified since I have given birth and reluctantly returned with my daughter to a country that has taken the bodies of Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland, Michael Brown, Alton Sterling, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Philando Castile, Atatiana Jefferson, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and many more.

I have no fear of a protest or protestors or even of rioters or looters. I have no fear of my fellow citizens (except maybe some of the gun-toting ones). I can get myself in and out of a dangerous situation — all the more easier when my daughter was in the seat on my bicycle than if, like now, she’d have to be on her own, us unconnected. It is an inappropriate police response that paralyzes me, imprisons me in my own home — and in my head.

A, K and I check in over text. K expresses her desire to head to the protest. I express my guilt over my lack of will. I feel ashamed of my response — or lack of response.

Unfortunately, the stream of police cars with the bicycles attached (that I associate with peaceful protests) morph throughout the day into a traumatizing montage of invisible — but not silent — unrest — in a very disturbing way.

I try to go about my day — Monday is looming and the housework and home admin must get done. But what does Monday even mean right now? What does work even look like on Monday? I sit at my desk to start the grocery order. I move to the kitchen to cook. I start moving plants to the balcony that have been waiting to be planted for months. I lay out a “magic screen” to hang on the balcony door. I tell Goose to get ready because we are going outside soon. I do all of this over and over and over again, in circles, unable to quiet the monologue in my head. Mid-afternoon, I see there is no traffic on the highway — 676, aka the Vine Expressway — which runs through the city. This is not a good sign.

The expressway is eye-level with our apartment.

We look. The police have blocked the highway. And then it begins. The activity that will continue throughout the weekend — that continues until now. Caravans of police — police vans, paddy wagons, state trooper SUVs — with their sirens back and forth across the expressway. Helicopters above us. The police car that is blocking the off-ramp angled just so, so that it is facing us. It is clear we are not going to go outside today, that I am not going to prove to myself that I am not afraid. I anxiously check my phone for news updates. Last time I had looked, the scheduled protests of the day had been peaceful; the first even socially distant. It is time to pot the plants.

We go to the balcony. In front of the police, with helicopters whirring above us, my stomach churning, Goose starts planting the herb garden my mother sent her for Easter; I am propagating plants.

How can I sit here potting plants? I am a coward.

I am planting new life, new life in honor of George Floyd. I feel calm for 30 seconds…or the length of that thought.

I am — if that officer is white, if that officer is prejudiced — defying a stereotype. I am planting plants with my daughter on a “nice” Saturday afternoon.

It is a good thing we did not go on the roof of the parking lot to jump rope. Are those police helicopters or news choppers? What if we had gone to the roof, and they mistook our jumping rope for aggressive behavior or got confused and thought we had weapons?

You are being a good parent for staying home. You could have gone to the City Hall protest and things would have been fine, and you would be continuing to model for your daughter social justice, like you used to. You would be doing what countless others are doing, and risking your life, because at this point, for us, it’s eithe"|1
2020-06-05|"DIRE HEADLINES had already been prepared before the release of America’s May jobs report on June 5th. Most analysts expected payroll employment to have fallen last month by several million, on the heels of record declines in March and April, and the unemployment rate to have jumped to nearly 20%. Instead, the Bureau of Labour Statistics reported a sharp increase in employment, of 2.5m, and a drop in the jobless rate from 14.7%, a post-Depression record, to 13.3%. Although the American labour market remains deeply troubled, President Donald Trump nonetheless convened a hastily called press conference to hail the news and declare the country back on the road to better days. “This is better than a V[-shaped recovery],” he said. “This is a rocket ship!”

Those bleak expectations had been set by a flow of dreadful economic news. Americans continue to file new claims for unemployment benefits by the million. Indices of economic activity showed that production kept declining across the economy in May, although at a far slower pace than in April. Yet some high-frequency indicators—such as restaurant bookings and measures of personal travel—had indicated signs of revival. And investors have been bullish for weeks, pushing stock indices close to new highs. They greeted the jobs data by sending the S&P 500 up by 2.6%.

But the details of the report, though encouraging, do not suggest that a rapid return to normality is imminent. New hiring was concentrated in service industries, primarily in health, leisure and hospitality. But the number of new jobs in May amounted to just a fraction of the total lost since February; the leisure industry added about 1.2m last month, but shed more than 8m in March and April. Part of the rebound in hiring can probably be explained by the structure of a federal aid programme intended to support small and medium businesses, which provides emergency loans that will ultimately be forgiven if lay-offs are avoided. Some of it, too, can be explained by initial steps towards reopening, as firms that were temporarily shut restarted work at dramatically reduced capacity. But although the number of Americans on temporary furlough declined, permanent lay-offs rose by nearly 300,000, taking the total to 2.3m. Disconcertingly, given the protests against police violence wracking the country, the jobless rate for black Americans ticked upwards, to 16.8%, while that for whites fell.

Labour-market data are very likely to keep improving over the summer, as state and local governments continue to ease lockdowns. The critical question for the American economy, however, is how many job losses and firm closures will prove permanent. Joblessness will probably remain well above normal levels, and policy support for the unemployed will continue to be justified. There are signs, however, that this surprising gust of good news may be undercutting interest in more spending in Washington. Meanwhile, the risk of new economic disruption, by covid-19 or by civil unrest, remains. The jobs figures were indeed a pleasant surprise. But it will be months, or years, until American workers can exhale without fear."|1
2020-06-05|"In late May, CanSino Biologics published the first data for its COVID-19 vaccine expressing spike protein. The vaccine generated neutralizing antibodies in many recipients and appeared safe, but the company, like others in this space, remains on alert for a dangerous phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). “It’s important to talk about it [ADE],” says Gregory Glenn, president of R&D at Novavax, which launched its COVID-19 vaccine trial in May. But “we can’t be overly cautious. People are dying. So we need to be aggressive here.”

There are mounting theoretical concerns that vaccines generating antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may bind to the virus without neutralizing it. Should this happen, the non-neutralizing antibodies could enhance viral entry into cells and viral replication and end up worsening infection instead of offering protection, through the poorly understood phenomenon of ADE. ADE “is a genuine concern,” says virologist Kevin Gilligan, a senior consultant with Biologics Consulting, who advises thorough safety studies. “Because if the gun is jumped, and a vaccine is widely distributed that is disease enhancing, that would be worse than actually not doing any vaccination at all.”

The degree of ADE vaccine risk for SARS-CoV-2 is unknown.

“Most experts who look at it acknowledge the potential risk but don’t see compelling evidence for it in humans right now,” says James Crowe, director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Center. Some view coronavirus ADE as a laboratory phenomenon, at least so far. “The theoretical possibility [of ADE] is there,” says Rafi Ahmed, director of the Emory Vaccine Center. “The more difficult question becomes, how do you balance this concern with moving forward? There’s not an easy answer.”

ADE was first described in 1977 by virologist Scott Halstead, then at the University of Hawaii. Halstead studied dengue, caused by four related but antigenically distinct viruses known as ‘serotypes’. Halstead noted that animals previously infected with one serotype did worse if infected again with a different serotype than if never previously infected at all. He found antibodies to be responsible for this phenomenon. Instead of neutralizing the virus, the antibodies facilitated viral entry into host cells in vitro. In his publication, Halstead presciently wrote: “Non-neutralising antibody presumably provides a specific molecular ‘ride’ for an infectious dengue virion into the interior of a receptive phagocytic cell.”

Halstead’s speculation was later proven correct, not just for dengue, a flavivirus, but for other viruses, including coronaviruses, in cell culture experiments. The coronavirus uses its spike protein to bind host receptors and infect airway cells. But it also can infect immune cells, typically macrophages. Anti-spike antibodies ideally bind and neutralize the virus, either by blocking spike binding to its receptor or by preventing fusion of the virus with the cell. But if antibodies fail to do this because they bind unproductively to the virus, these non-neutralizing antibodies may instead, using the Fc region at the base of the antibody, latch onto host macrophage Fc receptors and ferry the virus into these host cells, at least in vitro. Once inside, the viruses replicate and then exit to further spread infection to neighboring cells and tissues.

Poor-quality antibodies that bind the virus without neutralizing it are one reason vaccine candidates fail, and, in theory, could also cause ADE, delivering virions to host cells.

Can SARS-CoV-2 infect macrophages? “I don’t know,” answers Stan Perlman, a coronavirus expert at the University of Iowa. “Those data are not out there yet.” The virus can infect macrophages in vitro, but that doesn’t necessarily translate to in vivo human biology. “In tissue culture cells you can make almost any virus show this, by jigging the right cells, the right amount of antibody, and the right virus. But that [is] not really meaningful, because of the fact that it’s so artificial.”

The risk that a COVID-19 vaccine will cause ADE and facilitate infection “is completely theoretical,” says Novavax’s Glenn. “It’s a lab, an animal phenomenon that’s been observed. [But] in RSV it’s a real clinical event.” In a 1960s vaccine trial, 80% of infants and young children immunized against RSV (respiratory syncytial virus, an RNA virus in the family Paramyxoviridae) ended up hospitalized, and 2 children died. Only 5% of the children in the control group required hospitalization. Vaccinated children carried high titers of non-neutralizing antibodies, implicating ADE in the tragic outcome, although a T 2 (inflammatory) T cell response also probably contributed.

Since then, some vaccine studies in animals, as well as human trials where vaccinated people had worse outcomes, suggest ADE at work. But definitive evidence is lacking. “We can’t say they were not due to ADE, but there’s not evidence that they were,” says Ahmed. “There are many other ways that an immune response can cause damage.”

For coronavirus vaccines, the ADE story is similarly inconclusive. Cats vaccinated with spike protein against feline coronavirus died much faster than unvaccinated cats and carried more anti-spike antibodies, implicating ADE. But macaques vaccinated against SARS-CoV-1 did not show enhanced infection or disease.

In humans, limited data for vaccines against earlier coronaviruses did not show ADE. Two vaccines against the closely related SARS-CoV-1 appeared safe in early trials. A DNA vaccine against the MERS coronavirus in macaques protected all eight monkeys from infection symptoms, and that MERS vaccine was well-tolerated in a 2016 phase 1 human trial. MERS vaccine co-developer David Weiner, director of the Vaccine & Immunotherapy Center at the Wistar Institute, co-developed a very similar COVID-19 vaccine that Inovio Pharmaceuticals took into human trials in early April.

“We don’t see it [ADE] with flu, we don’t see it with so many other vaccines that we have,” says Ahmed. “We shouldn’t dismiss it completely, but then if you look at the broader world of vaccinology, this has not been seen.” But Gilligan says some earlier SARS and MERS vaccine candidates didn’t advance because of signs of ADE.

ADE is a concern for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) too, at least in theory, because mAbs that fail to neutralize the virus also could facilitate viral entry into cells. Many companies are working on such mAbs for either COVID-19 prevention or therapy. AstraZeneca, for example, is partnering with Vanderbilt, which has identified, expressed and evaluated virus-neutralizing antibodies from B cells recovered from convalescents. AstraZeneca will take the best ones forward into clinical trials.

ADE is part of the mAb discussion. “There’s not a lot of obvious epidemiologic evidence for it yet,” says Vanderbilt’s Crowe. Nevertheless, he says, “we will address this.” Crowe’s group will test for ADE by seeing whether its monoclonal antibodies can deliver viruses into macrophages, compared with antibodies whose Fc region has been inactivated. (An antibody lacking Fc can’t bind macrophage Fc receptors and thus can’t cause ADE. That’s why some companies are advancing mAbs with the Fc region knocked out.) Still, “the animal models are so inadequate right now, it would be very difficult to prove whether [ADE] is common or uncommon,” Crowe says.

For mAbs, the risk is probably low. “You’re already characterizing it as a highly neutralizing antibody,” says Ahmed. Convalescent antibody passive immunization trials, now underway, could carry some ADE risk, Ahmed says. “[But] I would be less concerned with that than with the vaccine that might be inducing suboptimal response.”

Vaccine companies are fully aware of ADE. “All the groups have been discussing this, everyone’s on the same page, everyone wants a safe [COVID-19] vaccine,” says Weiner. Inovio went forward into the clinic after showing safety in primates, and is reassured by the strong human safety record of its MERS vaccine. But vaccine trials are being approved “without the usual amount of preclinical safety/tox data available for guidance,” says Gilligan.

Given the urgency, the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency may have little choice but to give the go ahead to enter the clinic. Novavax launched a phase 1/2 trial of its vaccine, a stable prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimer nanoparticle vaccine with a saponin-based adjuvant, in late May. The company is experienced with viral vaccines: its nanoparticle flu vaccine recently met its phase 3 endpoints. The SARS-CoV-2 virus “is not new territory,” Glenn says, adding that Novavax and other vaccine companies can assay for whether antibodies can block spike protein–receptor binding, or neutralize the virus, or both, which should prevent infection.

And ADE? “One has to address it,” Glenn says, but he points out that ADE is only a theoretical COVID-19 vaccine risk. “It’s hypothesized from animal studies,” he says. “I think the way forward is to take it seriously, do some animal studies, show you don’t have enhancement, monitor during the trial. My view is, we can’t let this issue keep us from getting to a vaccine that will save millions of lives.”

But Anne De Groot, CEO of EpiVax, argues for a more nuanced approach. EpiVax develops T-cell-directed vaccines, using computational tools to select viral T cell epitopes. The company found SARS-CoV-2 sequences that would appear human to T cell receptors.

This could be a problem for any vaccine. “The T cells either don’t respond as strongly, because they think that the [coronavirus] spike is human, or that sequence can trigger a regulatory T cell response,” says De Groot. Such T cells can interfere with beneficial antibody production and “you don’t get neutralizing antibodies, you get the kind of antibodies that actually potentially enhance infection.” In other words, ADE.

2020-06-06|"The late management guru Peter Drucker who presciently advocated “back room” outsourcing and corporate decentralisation at a time when these smart cost-saving techniques were anathema to produce-everything-hire-everyone mega corporations, had a few more tricks up his sleeve.

One of his key mantras – price-led costing – often overlooked even today yet something profoundly relevant to all businesses, especially those connected with travel, is worth re-examining in a dysfunctional Covid-19 world.

The central argument is simple. Most companies tend to create a product they feel the market wants and outspend each other to produce it, subsequently passing on the entire cost to consumers with a further profit slab packed with humungous CEO salaries on top of all this extravagance. This is cost-driven pricing and is typical of the sort of big ego branding popular today.

Druker’s answer to this was blindingly simple. Check the price your audience might be willing to pay for a product and then keep production costs and profit margins within this budget. This is price-led costing. It is as relevant for airline seats as for luxury hotels.

Of course price-led costing (for any desirable good) is entirely predicated on scarcity, which drives price. One of the problems monster brands like Louis Vuitton faced in Asia was the sort of over exposure that instantly drove down perceived value often with perverse results. At one point Hongkongers shunned LV-monogrammed travel bags due to their mass popularity with Macau casino bumpkins.

As airlines posit scenarios in a Covid-19 or post-virus world it seems an inescapable truth that passengers will need to be distanced and isolated somehow to allay fears of contagion. With previous models entirely based on the sardine concept of spacing, packing in seats, and eliminating window exits to cram in more bodies, this is jarringly revolutionary.

Aircraft design will move towards more protected personal space with wraparound headrest partitions, novel seating configurations and, perhaps, access to cargo areas reconverted into gyms or wellness escapes. Family cabins may arrive in economy, modelled after the innovative Qsuites on Qatar Airways that can turn into quads for foursomes.

Fewer seats will invariably mean higher ticket prices. Will air passengers accept this additional burden on groaning wallets? Or might they consider it a worthwhile investment in emotional security or a sought after ‘luxury’ perk? In other words might travel once again become something expensive, rare, and unattainable, thereby bestowing upon it the original cachet of a romantic treat as in the days of the magnificent Pan Am Clipper flying boats?

Travellers will increasingly see luxury hotels as safe havens with trustworthy corporate protocols unlike the unregulated bottom-feeder Airbnb offerings, now fraught with unknown dangers. Private villa escapes will come to epitomise less is more, a phrase hitherto spouted by many but believed by few. Huge cookie-cutter fairy-lights hotels will not disappear as there is always space for mid-range products but, in a Covid world, there can be no scrimping on safety and this in turn will push prices up factoring in guest spacing, staff training, enhanced hygiene, lavish wellness partnerships and thermal-scanning equipment.

But regardless of whether price inches up or down, business models must be thoroughly reviewed and reset. Dropping oil prices (though this may be short term) and the Covid reality offer a huge opportunity for a travel rethink. It is time to abandon the sloppy cost-led pricing that has dominated monster travel projects, based on the assumption of ever-increasing hordes of cash-rich Chinese consumers. That is now a mirage as travel for the near term turns inward with a focus on domestic transactions and ‘safe corridors’ (pairing cities or countries) whether in China, USA, India, Thailand, or Indonesia.

Price-led costing will be the key, whether aiming for the luxury traveller or the less financially frivolous. It is a sound argument for any time and a good one to take onboard as globalism goes through a major adjustment in the face of mounting ultranationalist sentiment – with some manufacturing and business travel returning home over time.

Travellers willing to spend for a romantic break from the quotidian grind will make very careful choices and demand a lot more value. They will be in the driver’s seat now. Luxury travellers will not simply swarm marbled lobbies demanding free Bellinis. They will get tough.

Travellers looking for value will be equally demanding. Gone are the days when a guesthouse could say, ‘You get what you pay for.’ Safety cuts both ways. Hotels and airlines will need protocols to ensure their clientele is potentially okay just as travellers will examine holiday escapes in minute detail, perhaps preferring less trampled out-of-the-way places like the Maldives where privacy is ensured and social contact minimised.

Business travellers cautiously venturing out may be the hardest hit as this is the segment where the travel sector will try and make up for the loss. It would do well to remember though that with work-from-home and video conferencing much the rage, there is no inelastic demand anymore. Too much of a fare hike will dull corporate enthusiasm. Travel is already a significant cost for companies and medical-travel-labour insurance premiums will soar in a Covid world.

For a start, travel will stay close to home (and close to medical fallbacks) and we will become like kids learning to walk, picking up the courage to foray farther each day. But like that infernal coronavirus, travel is in the blood. We’ll find out which wins out. In the meanwhile, the travel industry can restore itself by stepping away from the mirage and incorporating sound pricing practices.

2020-06-06|"On April 30, the Government fast-tracked new legislation to introduce further tax changes in response to the impacts of the Covid-19 outbreak.

The key tax component of the Covid-19 Response (Taxation and Other Regulatory Urgent Matters) Act 2020 is a temporary tax loss carry-back measure.

Broadly, this allows businesses that anticipate being in a loss for the 2020 or 2021 tax years, to carry some or all of the loss back to the preceding year to enable an immediate cash refund of prior tax paid.

READ MORE:

 * Your questions on handling provisional tax now that Covid-19 has hit your cashflow



To be eligible, a taxpayer must have made or anticipate they will make a loss in either of the 2020 or 2021 tax years. The taxpayer must have a profit in the year prior to the loss year. This means:

* Losses from the 2020 year may be carried back to the 2019 year

* Losses from the 2021 year may be carried back to the 2020 year

Taxpayers can claim a tax refund for provisional tax paid by re-estimating 2020 provisional tax where the 2020 return is not yet filed, or by amending their 2019 tax return to factor in the loss carry back. The rules will apply to companies, trusts and individuals (other than those deriving only PAYE income) and those that operate through partnerships and look-through companies.

Overall, this is a very positive initiative, and one the Government should be commended for. However, because of its rushed implementation, it’s not perfect, not necessarily as straightforward as it seems and will not suit all businesses.

Each business will have different circumstances and each will need to consider whether this mechanism is the right option for them. Inland Revenue’s systems went live in early May with the changes so taxpayers can make elections to carry-back losses via the 'I want to' section of MyIR.

A few considerations and scenarios to reflect on are outlined below

Most business will be looking to use this mechanism in relation to a loss incurred in the 2021 year and carry this back to the 2020 income year which may still be profitable given Covid-19 may have only affected the last quarter of this year.

A business that needs cash urgently will want to elect to carry back its anticipated loss as soon as possible; however, a business will need to be fairly confident of the level of loss and think carefully about how the rest of the year will play out.

This is because, if a business over-estimates its 2021 loss which results in tax payable, use of money interest (UOMI) will apply from August 28, 2019 (for a March balance date taxpayer), which is the first instalment date of 2020 provisional tax. Further, it will not be possible to apply for relief from UOMI imposed under the remission rules recently enacted.

To minimise potential exposure to UOMI, the business might want to take a conservative position initially given we are only into the third month of the new tax year and re-estimate the loss later or as the year progresses.

However, holding off may not provide the much-needed cash now which could force some businesses to take some risks in this regard. Timing of electing, filing the return and monitoring losses will be key.

It will be possible to re-estimate the 2021 loss to carry back at any time prior to the earlier of the date the 2020 return is filed or the due date for filing.

The rules require the immediately preceding year to have taxable income. There will be some companies where the pattern of income and losses is such that the carry-back mechanism won’t be much, or any benefit.

For example, taxable income in the 2019 year might have been high under normal trading conditions and so 2020 provisional tax paid to date is based on residual income tax for this year.

Taxable income in the 2020 year (particularly if it is a late balance date) might have dropped, but may have only dropped to a lower taxable income and so it not yet a loss.

Even if there are large losses anticipated in 2021, these will only be able to be carried back to the extent of the lower taxable income in the immediately preceding year, which may not release that much tax paid.

Likewise, a company with a small loss in 2020 and a larger loss in 2021 will be constrained to only being able to use the smaller loss in 2020 to amend only the 2019 tax return, such that the company is unable to carry back the larger loss incurred in 2021.

Refunds might be limited or trapped

For taxpayers that are companies, any refunds will be limited to the credit balance in its company imputation credit account at the date of the most recently ended tax year (ie March 31, 2020, although some timing exceptions apply).

Therefore, if a company has been in the habit of paying most of its profits as dividends to shareholders and attaching imputation credits, it may find access to cash refunds is limited.

The policy rationale for this rule is that the company’s tax has been paid to shareholders already via imputation credits. Any trapped refunds may be applied to income or provisional tax liabilities, if any will exist.

If the company has traditionally paid out its profits for the year as shareholder salaries, the company won’t have any taxable income to carry future losses back to. The shareholders and not the company in this case have paid the provisional tax.

Therefore, an option might be for the shareholders to estimate 2020 provisional tax to nil and have the company elect to not pay any shareholder salaries for the 2020 tax year if losses are forecast for 2021 if this is possible.

However, this could then expose the company to an FBT liability if there are outstanding current accounts, so care is required. Other options may be feasible in this scenario.

The important point to note is that companies will need to do some work and determine what the approach to paying shareholder salaries should be in light of these rules.

The new Act contains an anti-avoidance measure, which could apply if shares in any company have been subject to an arrangement so that a loss company falls into the rules if the purpose of the arrangement is to defeat the intention of the rules.

It is possible any cute “tax planning” of this nature to deliberately take advantage of the rules would be scrutinised down the track.

We acknowledge the Government has brought these rules in under urgency to provide assistance for businesses in need of cash flow.

It has endeavoured to strike a balance of giving the much-needed assistance, accommodating the need for part year and grouping rules, while still maintaining some integrity measures. Unfortunately doing all these things inevitably leads to complex legislation.

The decision to use this mechanism will be heavily fact dependent on each business’s circumstances. There are policy design features that mean the rules will not be that useful to some of the SME businesses targeted.

It is clear it will not be the panacea for every business and could in some cases expose a taxpayer to significant UOMI or other taxes unless care is taken.

2020-06-06|"We are all Keynesians now with governments around the world shovelling cash into their economies to try to at least partially offset the economic damage of lockdowns. Even uber-prudent Germany has engaged in an extraordinary spending spree, first to support businesses during the closure period and then this week announcing big VAT cuts, a €300 family bonus for every child and another round of business supports.

Ireland’s Achilles’ heel in the past is that the government has spent when we had the money and then been forced to cut back in times of recession. Boom and bust cycles resulted. This time around, having entered the pandemic in reasonable economic shape and with the budget in surplus, we have some leeway. Ireland is engaged in a big fiscal stimulus,with government spending in the first five months of the year up by more than 20 per cent . Fortunately the State can still borrow money at negligible interest rates to fund the deficit that is opening up, thanks in part to unprecedented intervention from the European Central Bank.

So can the next government float into office on a wave of borrowed cash which it can dispense? Not really. A careful reading of the recent report from the budget watchdog, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, shows that each stage of the crisis will bring its own challenges – and that we simply can’t budget on the basis of being able to borrow at current interest rates forever. We are walking a shaky financial tightrope as we move through this.

The hard calls start on day one for the next government. Yes, ministers will have the cheque book out – but the queue at the hatch will be long and not everyone will get paid. You could argue about just how high the deficit could be this year – and the answer might well end up north of 10 per cent of gross domestic product – but there is a limit.

As well as the contentious issue of the phasing-out of wage and income supports, there are calls from business for more cash, a line-up of State bodies with big financial holes and so on. There is a strong case to go the extra mile on the once-off supports – and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe hinted on Friday that more help to protect businesses and jobs would likely be needed. But deciding what will be subsidised through the crisis and what won’t will be hugely controversial.

And as well as once-off costs, the need to provide ongoing higher levels of spending – in health, childcare, education, public transport and so on – provides a big budgetary challenge. Donohoe referred this week to the likely need to continue borrowing in the years ahead to fund higher spending levels.

The programme for government, if agreed, and the subsequent national recovery programme may give some context to this and to how the public finances might evolve. Right now we need it . The “A” word is being thrown around in relation to every proposed reduction of an emergency support programme, and every refusal to throw additional cash at some other problem.

What we are facing is not austerity – which is when a government hikes taxes and cuts spending to reduce the budget deficit during a recession. That is what happened in 2009 and 2010. Now government borrowing is soaring. The issue is making decisions on where the money goes to and how much we can spend – all against a backdrop of huge uncertainty. Pretending there is some endless supply of cash and no constraint at all on borrowing into the future is just not credible.

Choices will also await in what the IFAC called phase two, which is when the Government goes to stimulate the economy via higher spending, probably moving into 2021 if the opening-up goes okay. The council pencilled in €10 billion as a possible stimulus, though said it should be “temporary and targeted”. Again, you can just imagine the queue of mendicants for this . The money will only go so far and only last so long – and continued restrictions in areas like tourism might leave some sectors unable to benefit .

The council’s central expectation is that the economy might return to its pre-Covid position in a couple of years. That would be a result. With the economy growing, there would then be a job in adjusting tax and spending over a period of years to get the public finances back on a sustainable path. The council guesstimated that this might involve tax hikes and spending cuts of €6 billion to €14 billion, probably starting in 2023. But it should be possible to avoid another bout of severe austerity.

New government programmes, separate from the pandemic, will have to be paid for too and any credible programme for government must face the trade-offs. Not increasing the pension age, for example, will leave less to spend elsewhere. Green policies are vital, but come with a price tag.

We are facing into unprecedented uncertainty – we really don’t have any basis to decide how the next few months will go. The IFAC analysis shows just how delicate the outlook is and how a worse health outcome could cause real challenges

Economics is all about the allocation of scarce resources. And politics, over the next few years, will be too, and the uncertainties make this a lot more difficult. The ECB made clear this week that its programme to support the market would last until at least June of next year – and longer if needed. But it said, too, that it is a temporary intervention. And it would not be clever to assume current borrowing costs will continue for Ireland on the market once the ECB starts to wind down. The era of money for (almost) nothing won’t last forever. When it ends, we can’t afford to get caught out again, as we did in the last crisis."|1
2020-06-06|"A walk in the park? Just sign here...

Visitors to national parks must now make reservations before entering, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment says.

Parks are expected to be opened before the end of the month but visitors who usually can just walk in, must now register.

""Online reservations will be required for health reasons,"" Environment Minister Varawut Silpa-archa said.

The government's Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) is expected to lift many remaining lockdown measures next Friday.

All Covid-19 vulnerable sites including concert events, pubs and karaoke shops, massage parlours, amusement parks and national parks are expected to be reopened.

Mr Varawut said the same restrictions need to be in place at parks to help visitors to follow social distancing policies.

""By next week, we are going to have an announcement of what visitors should do and should not do while visiting the parks,"" he said.

""One of the certain measures is that visitors must make a reservation first. They cannot just walk in.""

He said the Department of National Parks (DNP) will use a sophisticated reservation system to control the number of park visitors.

He said national parks have high visitor rates, citing the number of people at Doi Inthanon National Park in Chiang Mai province on 30 Dec 2018 as being recorded at 20,469, according to DNP figures.

Apart of introducing the reservation policy, the minister said the DNP must require visitors to check in via the ""Thai Chana"" mobile application.

""I understand that there will be problem at the early stage of implementation so we are going to have a hotline to provide help and information for those who are in need,"" he said.

He said the reservation and check-in system is likely to be implemented until the Covid-19 pandemic is under control.

However, Mr Varawut said the DNP will consider using both measures in the long run in a bid to keep the number of park visitors at an optimal level, so the ecological system will not be strained.

He said the two-month lockdown during the Covid-19 crisis has allowed time for ecology in national parks to recover. The ministry is also considering new land zoning plans for national parks. Each national park will have zoning regulations based on public accessibility."|0
2020-06-06|"A south Dublin nursing home is closing because it is unable to meet its statutory and regulatory requirements to operate at full capacity or fund the costs needed to meet them.

St Mary’s Centre (Telford) on Merrion Road said the Covid-19 pandemic had no bearing on the decision to close and that the home, which has 35 residents, has remained free of the disease.

The care home said the “current and projected levels of funding from the HSE mean that the nursing home will not be able to meet the necessary statutory and regulatory requirements to operate at 100 per cent capacity” and that it was currently operating at 60 per cent capacity.

“This decision was reached by the board following a number of meetings and detailed reviews concerning the funding of the nursing home, the necessary implications for the viability of the nursing home and its capacity to meet statutory and regulatory requirements,” said the home.

St Mary’s said in a statement it could not recruit and retain staff needed “to provide the high standard of care of the residents to which the board aspires” or ensure full compliance with the requirements sought by State watchdog the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa).

The facility is located on a campus beside St Vincent’s hospital and is governed and run under the ethos of the Sisters of Charity.

“We have taken this extraordinarily difficult decision to wind down the operations of the nursing home in a careful and considered manner,” the home said.

“We have not been able to secure capital funding to address necessary infrastructure issues or revenue funding to meet current and anticipated operative costs so we have no alternative but to close.”

St Mary’s was the subject of a highly critical report in 2017 by Hiqa whose inspectors found it had failed to respond effectively to the needs of frail and highly dependent residents. A follow-up inspection by Hiqa in 2018 found that the home was still not complying with some regulations.

The home said the closure is being planned and organised over “the necessary period of time”, and that it intends to consult staff, residents and their families and keep in regular contact to ensure the transfers of residents happen “as smoothly as possible and with the minimum of disruption”.

Mervyn Taylor, executive director of Sage Advocacy, a support service for vulnerable adults, said the closure of St Mary’s was a concern. He called for further research to assess the strength of the nursing home sector to cope in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.

“We hope that this is not the start of a process of other closures and we think that some resilience study of the sector is required post-Covid to assess the level of risk in the event that more nursing homes, particularly smaller providers, want to get out of the market,” he said."|1

Are you longing to get back to the office, or do you love working from home? Have you started a new hobby? Learned a new skill? Send us a page from your COVID-19 diary.

In this instalment of our series, Deary Diary: In a Time of COVID-19, Isabella Lopez Rivadeneira tells us about coding and building robots during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This entry has been edited for clarity and length.

My name is Isabella L.R, and this is my fourth year on the Maplebots robotics team. We are based in Calgary, Canada, and I have to say, they've been the best four years of my life.

Being a 12-year-old, a few days ago we competed in the Robotics People online competition. With the COVID-19 crisis, a competition didn't seem like the best thing to do. Robotics People put one on, though, very strategically.

They put on an online competition in which we participated in the section called Mini Sumo for the very first time. I've participated in A-Mazing and Line Following, even Fire Fighting, but Mini Sumo is new to me. New to all of us at Maplebots.

Traditionally, in sumo, two bots go head-to-head in a fight to push the other one out of the dojo, but since we all need social distance, Robotics People played with the challenge a bit.

In Mini Sumo, your robot has to push 16 cups out of a circular dojo. That's quite a clever thing since there can't be two robots. Being new to the challenge, we took it on. That's how my brother and I kept ourselves busy, coding and building our robot.

Since it was a new challenge, we used a familiar robot. Edison is a robot from Australia that uses the platforms Edblocks, EdPython and Edscratch.

I have to say, it was a new and difficult experience, many all-nighters and failures. But when competition day came, we were ready. We had three rounds, and the less time your robot spent getting the cups out, the more points you had.

All those nights awake were worth it when in one of our rounds we did it in 22 seconds. That was the best score. We won!

Edison was fast enough to push all 16 cups out of a 79-centimeter dojo in 22 seconds. It really was a pleasure to get our first win on Robotics People, plus my first time doing it online.

Now my goal is to be better. We're still getting better, you see, but it's a lot of fun, especially with new challenges. We're not done competing, though. No matter if COVID-19 stops us from doing so in person, we'll still compete.

So, Dear Diary, expect to hear more of us!

2020-06-06|"Individual COVID-19 fatality risk (and the consequences for universities)

Reopening universities for the autumn term will be risky for individuals' health and safety. This column describes the latest epidemiological evidence and argues that the biggest influence on individuals’ risk of severe illness is age. Individuals in their sixties face a 30 times higher fatality risk from COVID-19 than individuals in their thirties. Being obese, non-white, a man, and having an underlying health condition also matter – each roughly doubles the fatality risk. But chronological age still remains the biggest risk – a fact that universities should keep in mind when planning their autumnal schedules.

Many European universities plan to re-open as physical spaces in the autumn of 2020. How much danger will that create? What is an individual’s risk of severe illness and death? How should university leaders take the health of their staff into account when planning for the next academic year (the economic issues were discussed recently in a VoxEU article by Peter Dolton)?

In our judgement, the most reliable source of information on the risk from COVID-19 is a 2020 “Open Safely” paper written by Elizabeth Williamson of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, with a large number of colleagues. It is a piece of technical epidemiological writing. We make an attempt to convey that paper’s substance in a way that we hope might be helpful to those enrolled and working in universities and the senior management teams who head them.

The first point to make is that the biggest influence on a person’s COVID-19 risk is age. The risk from age is actually an extraordinarily accelerating one (log-linear, as an approximation). There have been grumpy and inaccurate discussions of this issue of age and risk in UK newspapers where lobby groups attacked the idea that chronological age is what matters. Instead, the risk associated with so-called health conditions, with being a man, obese, non-white, or with having diabetes has been emphasized by the media.

Further, our two papers recommending a release out of the lockdown of the young have led to many older people reaching out to us voicing their beliefs that because they feel fit, they face little or no risk from COVID-19. Unfortunately, that belief is incorrect. Age is the crucial risk to bear in mind as shown by Williamson et al. (2020) (see Figure 1).

Figure 1 Deaths from COVID-19 in England and Wales since January 2020

Note: Number of deaths registered in England and Wales where COVID-19 was mentioned in the certificate – up to 15/05/2020

Examining anonymized health records of 17 million UK citizens, the authors assess who has died from COVID-19 while statistically adjusting for a large number of influences on people’s risk. Standard regression equations are then used to calculates hazard ratios. The results are the following:
• People between 50-60 face a fatality risk from COVID-19 that is approximately 14 times higher than the risk faced by those around the middle of the age band of 18-40.
• For individuals between 60-70 who are in good health, the risk is 30 times higher.
• The fatality risk of men is double that of women.
• Individuals with middle-aged spread, holding other things constant, face an about 50% higher risk.
• The same holds for non-white individuals as they face an almost doubled risk.
• Most standard kinds of health conditions also increase fatality risk, roughly 2 to 3 times, in general. The risk of individuals diagnosed with cancer is higher than the risk of men in general, but it is still lower than the risk of simply being old.

Hence, the most prominent risk indeed stems simply from age. In essence, this is due to young ‘animals’ stronger immune-response to most viruses also applying to COVID-19.

Some newspapers have confusingly run headlines proclaiming obesity as a major cause of COVID-19 deaths. However, while keeping ones BMI below 25 is certainly advisable and obese people undoubtedly face a higher risk of dying from COVID-19, the main reason why obese people are dying much more is because obese people tend to be older.

A second worrisome concern is the likelihood of misleading triumphalism in Europe over the coming summer. Premature optimism had lulled people already during the so-called Spanish Flu in the years of 1918-1919. Figure 2, taken from Taubenberger and Morens (2006), depicts the three waves of deaths from the Spanish Flu. The first wave, which at the time seemed very large, peaked in early summer of 1918. When it died down, policymakers took a more relaxed approach as they believed it to be over. Unfortunately, a second wave appeared in autumn of 1918 and the number of deaths this time was five times higher. A third wave followed in the Spring of 1919 but most deaths occurred in late autumn and winter just after the pandemic was believed to be over.

Figure 2 Deaths in the UK from the Spanish Flu 1918-1919

University presidents should keep this in mind when planning universities’ autumnal schedules. Our hunch is that misleading optimism about having beaten COVID-19 may appear by the end of the summer and lead to calls to open up UK universities in a really fundamental way. While it may be true that COVID-19 will really be over by then, it is also worryingly possible that we are in for some form of a re-run of 1918. As early hotspots for COVID-19 were places like meat packing plants and skiing resorts, which are both characterized by low temperatures, it is possible that the coronavirus microbe may prefer cold environments. Studying the Spanish Flu virus, He et al. (2013) conclude that every extra 10 degrees Celsius reduced the spread of this virus by nearly 50%. Of course, COVID-19 is a different virus which might behave differently and much is still to be learned about COVID-19.

A third concern is that the virus might mutate. However, there is not much that can be done about that except to hope for the best.

What should university faculty know and do?

First, faculty members might want to appreciate the fact that most students are young and hence face a rather miniscule risk - current estimates suggest that it may be about the same as the risk of dying in a UK road accident in a normal year. Second, university staff older than 50 may need to consider their own relative risk, and might prefer to avoid front-line contact with students until a vaccine is found. Third and more encouraging, current evidence suggests that even without a vaccine the great majority of Europe’s population will live through the pandemic without serious illness. Absolute risk for most people appears to be fairly low, and there even remains a slight chance that the virus will disappear more quickly than standard epidemiological modelling has predicted.

Still, there is a long and menacing path ahead of us for the coming autumn and winter, where it pays for each individual to know about their own relative risk. For university presidents and their management teams, it is essential to recognize that the COVID-19 virus is much more dangerous to older members of university staff. This time, age matters.

2020-06-06|"Across two Cabinet meetings on Thursday and Friday, Ministers discussed and then gave the green light to an unexpectedly dramatic acceleration of the lifting of the coronavirus restrictions.

Some around Government had wondered why the Taoiseach had convened a meeting in Dublin Castle on Thursday night, the first time the full Cabinet had met face-to-face since the restrictions were introduced in March.

At the meeting, Leo Varadkar and Minister for Health Simon Harris asked the Ministers for their views on what should be accelerated, and a discussion followed.

Those present say that having everyone in a room face to face allowed for a more free-flowing debate than has been the norm during recent meetings held via video link.

Minister for Rural Affairs Michael Ring, one of the most vociferous in arguing that the lifting of the lockdown could be accelerated, argued that the limit on travel should be abolished completely rather than expanded from 5km to 20km from Monday.

The Cabinet decided that people should be allowed to travel either 20km from their homes or anywhere else within their county. It was one of two occasions where the Ministers deviated from the advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET); the other being the decision to allow shopping centres to reopen from June 15th.

Minister for Business Heather Humphreys, whose public profile and stock across Government has risen during the crisis, argued that retailers in shopping centres should not be at a disadvantage to those on the high street, whose reopening had been agreed by NPHET.

Recent weeks had seen arguments within Government, and outside, about how much Ministers should adhere to the advice of NPHET and chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan.

The discussion and decisions across the two Cabinet meetings this week gave Ministers buy-in, and a sense of ownership, to what was ultimately announced.

But if there was pressure applied to NPHET and Dr Holohan to accelerate the lifting of the lockdown, it is likely to have happened behind the scenes.

Varadkar and Harris insist that the politicians have worked alongside their medical advisers throughout this process and, at the post-Cabinet press conference on Friday, the Taoiseach acknowledged that there was a back and forth between Government and NPHET on the way forward.

He pointedly told the Dáil on Thursday that he had asked Dr Holohan and NPHET to examine if some elements of the lockdown exit plan could be accelerated – measures moved from phase three to two and phase four to three, for example.

Dr Holohan had told NPHET he had been thinking about how to merge the final phases together, and Government sources pointed out that the decision to cut the original plan down from five stages to four came from NPHET itself.

Sources said NPHET discussions this week included claims that a decision not to bring forward more phases could be regretted if a further lockdown had to be imposed in the event of a second Covid-19 wave.

After the acceleration was announced, those who argued that the Cabinet should take more control away from NPHET were satisfied. Those who said NPHET and Government Buildings moved in line with each other pointed to a correlation between Dr Holohan’s letter to Harris recommending to proceed to the next phase on Monday and the final Cabinet announcement.

Those who had argued that the plan should be speeded up to lift the economy, boost domestic tourism and reduce the number of people out of work believed it was their stance that had won out."|0
2020-06-06|"On December 2019, the district of Wuhan in central China announced detection of a previously undescribed virus that led to clusters of pneumonia. The disease caused by this novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was subsequently named coronavirus disease 2019, the COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was declared as a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January and a pandemic on 11 March [1]. Despite lessons learnt from previous outbreaks, the preparedness and awareness for such a transmittable virus was inadequate to stop its spread of COVID-19 to over 4,700,000 patients with crude mortality of 6.6% as of May 19 2020 [2]. The mortality in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients remains high, and it is unclear if some of these patients may be rescued with ECMO.

There have been several viral outbreaks in recent memory, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic H1N1 influenza and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (Fig. 1). Whilst the SARS outbreak in China in 2002 [3] caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome through coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [4,5,6,7,8], there is minimal reported data on the use of ECMO. This was because ECMO was not commonly used at that time, even in those critically ill patients who did not respond favourably to conventional mechanical ventilation and other adjuncts [9]. There is some data on use of ECMO in MERS [10,11,12,13,14,15]. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic witnessed the rise of ECMO, and this in part can be attributed to the significant “age shift” with younger patients (< 65 years of age) getting more affected by the virus. Improvements in technology over time have certainly played a significant role too.

Since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, more evidence has emerged support venovenous (V-V) ECMO use in ARDS [16,17,18,19,20]. The use of venoarterial (V-A) ECMO for cardiac support is an evolving area and certainly needs further evidence. Although ECMO has a role in selected patients in context of the current pandemic, the criteria for patient selection and timing of ECMO initiation are yet to be defined. This is important to allow judicious use of available resources such resource-consumptive circumstances [21]. In this narrative review, the focus will be on the use of ECMO during previous viral outbreak as well as in COVID-19 to learn lessons regarding guidance of treatment that will benefit all of healthcare workers and patients."|1
2020-06-06|"The BCG vaccine does not protect against COVID-19: Applying an economist’s toolkit to a medical question

The prospect that BCG – a vaccine used primarily against tuberculosis – might offer protection from COVID-19 has become an understandably popular hypothesis. This column finds that hope misplaced. The authors exploit a natural experiment, overlaying the large difference in BCG vaccination rates with the large differences in COVID-19 infection rates between the former East and West Germany. They find that the differences are attributable not to BCG, but to the West’s copious commuter flow patterns and the fact that the epidemic arrived there first.

As COVID-19 has spread across the globe, so has an intense search for treatments and vaccines, with numerous trials running in multiple countries. Several researchers (e.g. Hegarty et al. 2020, Miller et al. 2020, Ozdemir et al. 2020) and prominent news outlets have noticed that countries still administering an old vaccine against tuberculosis had fewer coronavirus cases and fewer deaths per capita in the outbreak’s early stages. But is that correlation evidence that the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine provides some defence against COVID-19? In this column, we describe the findings of our recent work (Bluhm and Pinkovskiy 2020) looking at the incidence of coronavirus cases along the former border between East and West Germany, using modern econometric techniques to investigate whether historical differences in vaccination policies account for the lower level of infection in the East.

Tuberculosis has been largely eradicated from the developed world, and many rich countries have stopped using the BCG vaccine. Spain, which ended mandatory BCG vaccination in 1985, experienced more than 580 coronavirus deaths per million of its population and is one of the hardest-hit countries in per capita terms. Portugal, Spain’s neighbour, continues to perform mandatory BCG vaccination to this day and has experienced only 135 coronavirus deaths per million (all numbers as of 29 May 2020). More generally, studies have documented that countries with mandatory BCG vaccination tend to have substantially fewer coronavirus cases and fewer deaths per capita than countries without mandatory vaccination, and that the intensity of the epidemic is lower for countries that began vaccinating earlier (e.g. Hegarty et al. 2020, Miller et al. 2020, Ozdemir et al. 2020). Such cross-country correlations do not imply causation (Belloc et al. 2020) and sceptics have rushed to suggest that the passive immunisation from the BCG vaccine would at best be short-lived (Faust et al. 2020). The WHO now cautions that there is currently no evidence that the vaccine protects against the novel coronavirus (WHO 2020).

Because they are often unable to perform randomised experiments, economists have developed a suite of methods to exploit “natural experiments” that occur by chance as human action unfolds. We use one of these tools—a geographic regression discontinuity analysis (Dell 2010)—to determine whether coronavirus prevalence changes markedly at the Cold War-era border between East and West Germany, whose vaccination policies differed prior to their reunification in 1990. East Germany had mandatory BCG vaccination until reunification, while West Germany stopped voluntary but de facto universal vaccination in 1975.

Our setting presents a puzzle of its own. Many observers in Germany have noticed a much lower coronavirus prevalence in the former East than in the West but found few convincing explanations for the difference. Moreover, low mortality in Germany as a whole has been the subject of widespread speculation. We provide formal evidence that there is indeed a sizable discontinuity in COVID-19 cases at the border, flexibly controlling for everything continuous there. Other important variables—such as disposable income and average age—also jump at the border, but do not explain the discontinuity in COVID-19 cases. However, the difference in coronavirus prevalence is uniform across age groups rather than being dependent on whether individuals were born before or after the cessation of (near) universal vaccination in each part of the country. This fact cannot be explained by a broader immunity acquired via the BCG vaccine.

COVID-19 prevalence is much higher in former West than in East Germany

We start our analysis with a map of coronavirus cases by county as of 26 April, using data from the Robert Koch Institute. The former border between East and West Germany is outlined in red. The darker the shading of a county, the more coronavirus cases it has per million inhabitants. Several counties with high concentrations stand out (such as Heinsberg, bordering the Netherlands, and much of Bavaria – both places where the epidemic was first recorded). There is clearly a greater density of coronavirus cases around major cities (Berlin, Hamburg, and Stuttgart), as in the US. More importantly, we immediately see that counties just to the west of the former border are a much darker shade of blue than counties just to the east.

Notes: Illustration of the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in Germany as of 26 April 2020. The map shows the log (1 + cases/million people) in each county using population data from 2018.

To formalise the intuition of this map, we use a regression discontinuity design in which we nonparametrically estimate coronavirus prevalence as a function of the distance to the border and compare estimates from the eastern and western sides. We present a graphical representation of this exercise in the chart below, where the dependent variable is the logarithm of coronavirus cases per million inhabitants—a gauge of the exponential spread of the virus. The jump at the border is about 0.7 log points, which implies that there are half as many cases per capita in a former East German county than in a West German county just across the border. This halving of cases dominates the variation in coronavirus prevalence among counties in the East (where it is uniformly low) and is sizable relative to the average prevalence in the West. Far-away counties in Bavaria or near the border with France have the highest cases, but a smooth spread from there would imply a continuous decline, and cannot explain the precipitous drop at the border.

Figure 2 Discontinuity in log (1 + cases/million) at former border

Notes: Illustration of the discontinuity log (1 + cases/million people) across the former border between West and East Germany. The figure shows non-parametric local polynomial estimates for bins of the dependent variable, where each bin is 20 km wide; 95% confidence intervals are shaded in grey.

BCG vaccination is not driving this discontinuity

Our key piece of evidence makes the BCG hypothesis appear very unlikely. We exploit the fact that East Germany had mandatory vaccination from 1953 to 1990, while West Germany recommended vaccinating everyone from 1961 to 1975. If the vaccine protects against the virus, then we would expect that discontinuities in detected cases among people aged 15-34 (most of whom did not get the vaccine anywhere) would be small or non-existent. On the other hand, discontinuities among people aged 35-59 (all of whom were vaccinated in the East, as opposed to only those above age 45 in the West) should be larger. The chart below shows that the discontinuities in coronavirus prevalence for both age groups are stark and roughly identical in size, contradicting what we would expect to see if the BCG hypothesis were true. Moreover, for early April, we have more fine-grained data on cases for individual ages, allowing us to form age groups that directly correspond to the policy shift in BCG vaccination. They also show discontinuities that are equal or even smaller in the older cohort.

Figure 3 Age-specific discontinuity in log (1 + cases/million) at former border

Notes: Illustration of the discontinuity log (1 + cases/million people) across the former border between West and East Germany for different age groups. The left panel shows results for ages 15-34 and the right panel shows results for ages 35-59. Both figures show non-parametric local polynomial estimates for bins of the dependent variable, where each bin is 20 km wide; 95% confidence intervals are shaded in grey.

Alternative explanations: Commuter flows and the geography of the early outbreak

If the BCG vaccine does not explain the East-West differential in coronavirus cases, then what does? Historically, pandemics have been spread by the movement of people and trade from one area to another (Voth 2020), so in that spirit we investigate Germany’s commuting patterns. If those who live in the West work in the West and, in spite of a large wave of migration post-reunification, most former East Germans still work in the East, it may be the case that travel flows have not readjusted completely since reunification. In other words, Western counties along the former border may remain more disconnected from their Eastern neighbours than they would if a national border had never divided them. As the epidemic started in the West, it may have had a harder time spreading eastward because relatively fewer people commute between East and West than commute across comparable distances within the West or within the East. The eastward spread of the virus was then further interrupted by the nation-wide lockdown instituted on 22 March.

We simulate a canonical SIR model of the coronavirus epidemic in each German county, allowing infections to spread along commuting patterns starting from the distribution of coronavirus cases on 29 February (Bjørnstad and Grenfell 2008, Wesolowski et al. 2017). We find that in the simulated data, the number of cases also discontinuously declines as one crosses from West to East over the former border, with a decline smaller but close in magnitude to the decline observed in the actual data.

2020-06-06|"Valuating health vs wealth: The effect of information and how this matters for COVID-19 policymaking

The behavioural interventions to control the spread of COVID-19 present trade-offs between health and wealth. To be successful, an understanding of how the public currently values lives over economic loss is needed. A survey experiment in the US and UK finds that people highly prioritise saving lives, but this valuation will change as economic losses mount. Individual differences in valuation also predict individual compliance with COVID-19 policies, and information on COVID-19 deaths and income losses can affect valuations. Caution in relaxing the lockdown will help build public support and mitigate polarising effects and, through increasing compliance, improve its economic efficacy.

In the absence of medicine-based responses to COVID-19, policymakers have to rely on behavioural interventions to control the transmission of the virus. Yet, at least in the short run, these interventions create a trade-off between saving lives and saving the economy – a ‘health–wealth trade-off’. The lockdown restrictions on individual freedoms, for example, saved lives by preventing transmission, but they came at the cost of lost output and income (Baldwin and Weder di Mauro 2020).

Relaxing a lockdown involves the same trade-off but in reverse: the economy recovers but at a cost of an increased threat of virus transmission. There are similar potential medium-term trade-offs in the choice between strategies of herd immunity and so-called ‘hammer and dance’ (Pueyo 2020). Faced with such health–wealth trade-offs, how should policymakers decide where to locate the balance?

This question has led policymakers to dust off risk-valuation manuals to see whether the proposed movement makes cost-benefit good sense. For instance, the OECD (2012) suggests, on the basis of evidence, that a figure between $1.5–$4.5 million should be used as the statistical value of life, with a base value of $3 million (the EU uses a slightly wider range and a higher base value of $3.6 million).

Armed with such a figure, consider the UK lockdown. The Imperial College modellers predicted that lockdown would save several hundred thousand lives (Ferguson et al. 2020), whilst current estimates point to a lockdown loss of more than 10% of GDP (Bank of England 2020); 10% of GDP is £221,489 million. Thus, even if only one, rather than several, hundred thousand lives had been saved, the lockdown would have cost about £2 million per life saved and would have produced a net benefit, using the OECD’s base figure valuation of a life at $3 million. Beyond 100,000 lives saved, the net benefit from lockdown quickly becomes enormous.

Setting aside arguments against using cost-benefit analysis in such decisions, there are two problems with recycling OECD (or other) estimates of the value of a statistical life. First, the figures vary widely and – although the OECD proposes a range, any part of which would probably make the lockdown yield a net benefit – they refer to the value of a statistical life. COVID-19, however, produces mortality disproportionately in the old and those with co-morbidities.

So perhaps the alternative quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) approach – whereby quality-adjusted life-years saved are valued – should be used. With as much as 20% of those over 70 who die from COVID-19 being likely to die within one year anyway, and a QALY value of between £20–30,000, a positive net benefit from lockdown becomes much less likely.

The second problem is deeper. The policy choices relate to COVID-19 deaths; not imaginary deaths in the past and not some medical intervention that might prolong life by one year. Thus, what plausibly matters is how people currently value such deaths. This is for two reasons.

First, how people value health over wealth in this period obviously matters for the politics of these decisions. Politicians are re-elected by the people who assess government performance by their own lights; not by how well the government executed a manual’s implicit assessment.

Second, people’s current valuation may matter because there is evidence that people are more likely to follow rules when they agree with them (Tyler 1990). We don’t know whether this is the case for COVID-19 lockdown policies, but if it is, then the efficacy of any lockdown or its relaxation also depends on whether its movement on a health–wealth trade-off accords with the public’s relative valuation of health over wealth.

Of course, although these considerations are real, they would not matter if we had reason to believe that people’s assessments in such matters were relatively constant (in that case, the OECD’s summary might apply). Yet we don’t. In fact, we know such assessments are extremely sensitive to exposure to the risk in question (e.g. Gigerenzer 2014) – think of the exodus from flying in the US post-9/11.

So, features specific to COVID-19 will influence people’s current COVID related health–wealth valuation. This is why we conducted a survey experiment in the UK and the US to see how people actually value health over wealth in the context of COVID-19 and the lockdown (Hargreaves Heap et al. 2020).

The survey consists of a sequence of binary choices between pairs of health and wealth outcomes for each country. The sequence is designed so that anyone who values both ‘lives saved’ and ‘average household income’, and has a preference ordering over their various combinations, will switch at one point from the option that always does as well or better than the other on health, to the option that does better on wealth. Where they switch is an indicator of their relative valuation of health over wealth and can be interpreted as giving the lower bound for the value of life.

The experimental element comes from asking participants to make this sequence of choices a second time. After the first occasion, the participants engage in another task and are then divided into three sub-groups. One sub-group receives an information prompt on the predicted number of COVID-19 deaths (per million) by August; another receives an information prompt on the predicted loss of GDP per capita through lockdown measures in 2020. The final sub-group is our control group; they hear a short piece of instrumental music instead.

The participants then make the decisions over health and wealth combinations again. This experimental element allows us to test for the robustness of the health–wealth valuations (do they change much in the control?) and for whether they respond in predictable ways to information on deaths and income losses (in the two information treatments).

We find that in the peak of the pandemic in the UK and US, the average implicit value of a COVID-19 life was extremely high by the standards of the OECD figures. The average value is a factor of around ten times greater than usual. This means that the lockdown policy accorded very well with the public’s preferences for health over wealth at that time. Indeed, the lockdown policies were met by increased support for the governments imposing them (Blais et al. 2020).

We also find that the individual variation in this valuation predicts individual compliance with the lockdown measures in both countries. So, policymakers do need to care about what the people think in this matter, not just for political reasons of re-election, but also because it affects the efficacy of any policy change through its influence on compliance.

This experimental evidence gives us a clue as to whether the valuations will change as the experience of COVID-19 deaths recedes and income losses mount (see Midoes 2020): they will.

On the one hand, the high valuation of COVID-19 lives saved implies that any relaxation of the lockdown – which will produce a spike in COVID-19 deaths – will court unpopularity and lack of compliance. On the other hand, information on COVID-19-related fatalities and growing income losses will lead people to adjust their relative valuation of health over wealth towards wealth (see Hargreaves Heap et al. 2020).

In short, the longer that relaxation of the lockdown is delayed, people will become more tolerant of any increased deaths associated with the relaxation because income losses increase with delay. This insight complements an earlier one on the gains from the delay that come from better information on how to relax a lockdown (Santos-Pinot and Mata 2020).

Moreover, whilst unexpected deaths will, in general, put a brake on the drift to valuing wealth relatively more highly, they also tend to polarise the valuations of health over wealth in the UK (Hargreaves Heap et al 2020); this is in a context where there is already evidence of polarisation in other respects (see Gambacorta et al. 2020). Both effects reinforce the argument for caution in relaxing the lockdown because a delay will help avoid the braking and polarising effect of unexpected deaths on people’s valuation of health relative to wealth as it otherwise drifts – in both the UK and the US – towards wealth.

The politics of loosening (and potentially re-tightening) lockdowns are not straightforward (see Aksoy et al. 2020), not least because standard tools employed, such as information provision (see Fetzer et al. 2020), might generate unintended consequences that undermine policy objectives. At a minimum, they should at least be facilitated by analyses of the public’s relative valuations of health and wealth.

2020-06-06|"O past week Bangladesh, India and Pakistan have largely lifted nationwide lockdowns intended to curb the spread of covid-19. The freeing of 1.7bn people—more than a fifth of humanity—from varied restrictions will bring relief to the region’s battered economies. Alas, it promises no relief from the pandemic itself. In luckier countries, stay-at-home rules reduced the number of new infections. In South Asia they managed only to moderate the disease’s acceleration, but not to halt it (see chart). The lifting of the lockdowns, in turn, is likely to hasten its spread again.

With some 350,000 confirmed cases and fewer than 9,000 deaths so far, the region’s toll looks relatively modest. Yet those numbers disguise both widespread undercounting and a rate of growth that was frightening even before the lifting of restrictions. At the current pace, the numbers are doubling every two weeks, suggesting that by the end of July, when some models predict the outbreak will peak, the official number infected may reach 5m and the death toll could approach 150,000.

Low levels of testing mean that the real numbers could be far worse. One foreign health official in Pakistan reckons the death toll is between two and three times the government’s count. John Clemens of ICDDR,B (formerly the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh), estimates that Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital, may already have as many as 750,000 cases, even though the official national tally is less than 60,000.

In harder-hit parts of the region, health services are under severe strain. Madhuri, a 46-year-old nurse in Thane, a suburb of Mumbai, had been working 12-hour shifts with no days off from April 1st until she herself caught covid-19 from a patient in May. The government hospital where she works does not treat the disease, passing positive cases to designated covid hospitals. But Madhuri (not her real name) says her colleagues must instead cope with the patients those places no longer treat. “We now do 60-70 deliveries a day, up from 40-50 in normal times, in addition to stab wounds, accidents and so on.” Her hospital’s 20-bed intensive care unit is staffed by just two nurses and its 16-bed isolation ward by just one, she says. Her experience is far from unusual. Three medical interns at another hospital in the centre of Mumbai recently released a video claiming that they had been left for hours in sole charge of 35 seriously ill covid-19 patients, with no doctors, nursing or cleaning staff to help. Another viral video revealed that corpses wrapped in plastic had been left in a covid ward full of patients, owing to lack of space in a hospital morgue. Staff at hospitals across India have repeatedly protested against unsafe conditions, poor equipment and long working hours. In Delhi, the capital, some 600 health workers have tested positive for covid-19—including 329 at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, the country’s grandest government hospital. Overall, India has a ratio of doctors and nurses to population that is half China’s and a quarter of Europe’s. And the virus has now spread from better-served cities to poor rural states such as Jharkhand, where there is one doctor for every 6,000 people. Doctors in Pakistan say the government’s claim that there are adequate hospital beds is nonsense. “The situation is very, very unsatisfactory,” says Qaisar Sajjad of the Pakistan Medical Association, predicting a surge in cases stemming from the recent holiday marking the end of Ramadan. Zubair Zahir, head of a local doctors’ association in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, fears its hospitals could run out of intensive-care beds and ventilators within the next two weeks. The crisis has already squeezed other services: despite a resurgence of polio, an immunisation campaign in the province has been suspended. In India treatment of endemic diseases such as tuberculosis, which kills some 400,000 people a year, has also been impeded. In normal times, the region’s rich can largely insulate themselves from the implications of decades of puny public spending on health. “If they so much as sneeze they flee to Thailand, Singapore or India,” says a doctor at a private hospital in Dhaka. Now, she says, it is “almost impossible” to gain admission to Bangladesh’s elite hospitals, whether for covid-19 or other illnesses.

Finding places in morgues, cemeteries and crematoria is also becoming a challenge. At the municipal graveyard of Narayanganj, an area with lots of garment factories on the outskirts of Dhaka, a typical month sees fewer than 250 burials. Last month it jumped to 575, only 70 of which were officially recorded as victims of covid-19. Jawahar Baug, the biggest crematorium in Thane outside Mumbai, has seen a similar jump in custom. It has boosted its staff from 30 to 50 men working three shifts a day, while the volume of bodies they manage has grown from four to six a day to sometimes as many as 20. Delhi has relaxed a ban on traditional funeral pyres made of wood, instituted to reduce pollution, because there are too few gas-fired ovens to meet the spurt in demand.

Inevitably, the failure of all three countries to control the pandemic has led to soul-searching and blame-casting. Imran Khan, Pakistan’s prime minister, has loudly pointed out that he was never a fan of the lockdown, which he had warned would hit the poor unduly hard, and could only slow the disease. His detractors respond that a big reason for failure was precisely the half-hearted and inept way Pakistan’s lockdown was enforced. In Bangladesh, inconsistent rulemaking, a collapse in average income in slum areas of an estimated 75% and the mass return to villages of hundreds of thousands of garment-workers undermined any gains from the lockdown.

Perhaps the most egregious errors were made by India’s government. Despite imposing the most stringent and heavily policed restrictions in the region, the government failed to foresee that its measures might prompt a mass exodus from cities of tens of millions of migrant workers made suddenly destitute. The authorities first tried to block the movement, bottling migrants in urban slums with the highest infection rates, and then allowed perhaps 20m workers to leave, spreading the disease across the country. In Bihar, a state whose 110m people are among India’s poorest, more than two-thirds of covid cases identified so far have been among returning migrant workers.

Whatever the cause, the damage is now done. Farid Uddin, a gravedigger in the Bangladeshi port city of Chattogram (formerly Chittagong), comes close to tears as he explains that he and his team have scarcely slept in four days. “There are so many deaths,” he gulps. “We are overwhelmed. Please pray for us so Allah forgives us and takes back this disease.” ■"|1
2020-06-06|"Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said Ireland has “earned the right to be hopeful about the future again” as the Government dramatically accelerated the roadmap to lift coronavirus restrictions.

The plan to reopen the country after months of lockdown will largely end on July 20th, and only comprise four phases rather than five.

People will be able to travel within their own counties from Monday and the domestic tourism industry will reopen from June 29th in an effort to salvage some of the summer season.

However, in recommending that Ireland progress to the second phase from Monday and accelerate the lifting of restrictions, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) warned that “stricter measures” may need to be reintroduced if there was an upsurge in cases of Covid-19.

In a letter sent on Thursday to Minister for Health Simon Harris, Dr Tony Holohan, the chief medical officer, said it was “impossible to predict with certainty what the future trajectory of the Covid-19 disease will be in Ireland”.

The emergency team said the “easing of measures always has the potential to increase the risk of transmission of infection” and concerns were raised that workplaces had the potential to become “foci” for new clusters as public health measures were eased.

The acceleration in reopening came after two Cabinet meetings on Thursday night and Friday morning, with Ministers choosing to deviate from the advice of the team on two issues: the decision to allow people travel within their counties from Monday; and to allow shopping centres reopen, albeit with restrictions, on June 15th.

Some Ministers said the Cabinet had taken the initiative, while Mr Varadkar and Mr Harris said the team and the Government had worked together.

Mr Varadkar said the third phase and the fourth, final phase – which will take effect from June 29th and July 20th respectively – would be redefined in the coming weeks, in a process led by NPHET.

The Taoiseach has said he wants to lift the 14-day quarantine requirement for people arriving into Ireland from other countries which have been successful in tackling the virus – effectively allowing Irish people go on foreign holidays to certain destinations – but it is not yet clear from when this might apply.

Government sources suggested the so-called air bridges could take effect from July 20th.

Announcing the changes, Mr Varadkar said: “During this emergency we have suffered as a country, lost loved ones and changed the way that we work and live. We are making progress. We are heading in the right direction. And we have earned the right to be hopeful about the future again.”

Dr Holohan said the emergency team would “develop some guidance” around the two-metre social distancing rules for the hospitality sector during periods of low transmission.

Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin welcomed the changes, particularly the easing of restrictions on travel, while Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the acceleration was “great news all round”.

Mr Harris said everyone had a role to play in ensuring the country could “safely find a way to live alongside” coronavirus. Health Service Executive chief executive Paul Reid said now was the time for “strengthened personal vigilance”, such as doing the “small hygiene things very well”.

Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty also announced on Friday that the wage subsidy scheme, which is subsidising almost 500,000 workers, and the pandemic unemployment payment, which Ms Doherty said provided help to 600,000 people, would continue until the end of August.

From June 29th, the €350 weekly pandemic unemployment payment will drop to €203 for those who earned an average wage of €200 a week or less, while those who earned more than €200 will still receive €350. Mr Donohoe said it may be the case that the wage subsidy scheme outlasts the pandemic unemployment payment.

But other challenges face Ministers, such as the request from Minister for Transport Shane Ross for a €460 million bailout for bus and rail operators whose incomes have been reduced during the pandemic."|0

2020-06-07|"New Zealand Music Month may have come to an end, but for Kiwi musicians the challenges of running the business side of their music careers continue.

In an interview for small business platform Manaaki, Matiu Walters of Six60 has opened up about the business model that took the five-piece band from their first album in 2011 to performing at sold-out stadiums throughout New Zealand in February this year.

Manaaki co-founder Pat MacFie said the chat was set up to help artists hit hard by the restrictions from Covid-19.

“We are finding on the forum that creatives are really feeling the effects of Covid-19 restrictions so it is an area we are throwing some support around.”

“Matiu and the guys have created an incredible business model that disrupts everything traditional about the music industry. So we wanted to unlock their patterns and framework to help artists who are doing it tough right now.""

Walters spoke candidly on Instagram about the band's method for success, which started when they hired an engineer from the Rock Shop in Dunedin to record their first album.

Matiu explained how the band’s following grew organically in the beginning but being decisive and having “ridiculous” goals helped get them to the next level.

An early goal was to maintain control over their own music, catalogue, publishing and rights, so they established Massive Entertainment.

""It wasn't good enough to just be a band and write songs. Let's be moguls,"" Walters said.

Walters talked about how the band held all the takings from their first Western Springs gig and used it to fund their next 'big play' which ultimately led to their biggest year yet and sold-out stadiums in Lower Hutt, Whangarei, New Plymouth, Hamilton, Auckland and Dunedin.

He also covered some of the challenges the band faced over the years, including negative opinions around their identity.

“Some were saying it’s not white enough but it’s not brown enough, we were doing whatever we felt was cool to us, and that pissed some people off.”

“We are going to do this our way and represent this place and who we are to the maximum.”

When it comes to failures, Walters believes they are equally as important as success.

“They’re two walls you bounce between. As long as you’re going in the right direction, you’ve got to take it as it comes.”

His advice to those in business now is to keep moving.

“Get off your ass and begin. And never stop. Just keep going and never take ‘no’ for an answer.”

The Government has announced a $175 million package to support jobs in the music and arts sector and last Saturday Six60 played a recording of their last Western Springs Concert on TVNZ.

MacFie said it is great to see support for the cultural sector and hoped big business and fans would get behind the industry as well.

“There are many ways we can show Manaaki. Music gets us through the tough times and now, as a country, we need to help the music makers get through. We want the creatives out there to know they are not alone.”"|2

 Sunday, RTÉ One, 9.30pm

 Okay, Montrose, the jig is up. We know your little game. You’re trying to distract us during lockdown by rerunning some of the best telly programmes around. Did Leo put you up to it? First it was the return of Love/Hate, and now it’s another outing for the wonderful Derry Girls. You’re hoping we’ll be so immersed in the comedic activities of Erin, Orla, Claire, Michelle – and James – we won’t notice how our civil liberties have been trashed and we’ll be too busy laughing our heads off to bother storming Government Buildings to protest at the loss of freedoms.

Derry Girls is set in the titular city in the 1990s, at the height of the Troubles, and stars Saoirse-Monica Jackson as self-delusional teenager Erin, with Tara Lynne O’Neill as her tough, uncompromising mother, Tommy Tiernan as the hapless dad, and Ian McIlhinney as the fearsome grandad. Comedic genius runs through every scene in this series, and there are stand-out performances from the cast, including a meme-friendly turn from Siobhan McSweeney as the terminally jaded school principal Sr Michael. What, there’s an anti-lockdown rally on O’Connell Street? Sorry, I’m busy, er, washing my hands.

In times of great crisis, we look for a great leader to bring us comfort. A calm, authoritative presence to soothe our fevered brow and tell us everything’s going to be all right. And lo! Daniel O’Donnell has answered Ireland’s call, and is inviting us all into his home in Kincasslagh for a brand new series that promises to banish all pandemic anxiety from our souls. Daniel will dispense great wisdom and spiritual guidance, dish out the chat and the craic with special guests, and even demonstrate his newly acquired hula-hooping skills. The nation can breathe easier knowing that Daniel is watching out for our wellbeing from his Donegal eyrie.

In the first episode, Daniel chats with Clannad star Moya Brennan, from just up the road in Gweedore, about how Covid-19 has disrupted the band’s plans for a farewell tour. We’ll also meet one of the many Irish couples whose wedding plans have been thrown into disarray by coronavirus, and Daniel will reconnect with his old friend Gloria Hunniford. His better half, Majella, will also drop in at regular intervals, but will Daniel sing an aul’ song? Is the pope a Catholic?

Romeo and Juliet: Royal Shakespeare Company

 Sunday, BBC4, 9pm

 Shakespeare’s most tragic love story is revived in this modern interpretation by the RSC. Filmed live in Stratford-upon-Avon, deputy artistic director Erica Whyman’s lively 2018 reimagining focuses on the pains of adolescence and the difference in settling conflicts with words instead of violence. Bally Gill and Karen Fishwick are utterly believable and very touching in the title roles, joined by Afolabi Alli as Paris, Donna Banya as Gregory and Charlotte Josephine as the bold Mercutio.

In 2018 Britain was rocked by the Windrush scandal, after it emerged that the Home Office was detaining and deporting migrants and children of migrants brought to the UK from the Caribbean as part of the so-called Windrush generation. These migrants were British subjects, and many were born in the UK or had arrived before 1973. But thanks to then Home secretary Theresa May’s immigration policies, they were targeted because their papers were not “in order”. This one-off drama tells the story of one such citizen, Anthony Bryan (played by Patrick Robinson), who has been living in the UK since he was eight, and now has a family of his own. When Bryan applies for a passport in order to visit his mother in Jamaica, he learns to his horror that there is no record of him as a British citizen. Soon his life is turned upside-down as he is forced out of his job, denied benefits and idetained as an illegal immigrant.

Inside Monaco: Playground of the Rich

 Monday, BBC2, 9pm

 Last summer the BBC sent a camera crew into the tiny but powerful principality of Monaco to find out how the other 1 per cent lives. Monaco is the second-smallest country in the world, but it’s also one of the richest, and if you’re not at least a millionaire, dahling, then you’ve no business being here. So why is Monaco so attractive for the super-rich? Simple: they pay no income tax! We meet some of these super-rich on their home playground, as well as some of the army of staff on helicopters (Monaco’s taxis) superyachts and luxury hotels who must cater to their every whim. We also gain access to the palace of Prince Albert II and go trackside at the Monaco Grand Prix with former Formula One winner David Coulthard and F1 owner Eddie Jordan. Since this series was made, Monaco has been hit with coronavirus, with 99 cases and four deaths out of a population of 38,300, but you can bet its citizens are having a very comfortable lockdown.

The Secret She Keeps

 Tuesday, RTÉ One, 10.15pm

Two women, both with very different lives, but both apparently wanting the same things. This new Australian psychological thriller series, based on the bestselling novel by Michael Robotham, is a tale of what happens when you covet another person’s seemingly perfect life. Meghan (Jessica De Gouw) is a successful “mommy blogger”, presenting an image of maternal bliss to her vast internet following. Agatha (Laura Carmichael) is a supermarket shelf-stacker who envies Meghan and longs for an Instagram-friendly family of her own. But of course, nothing is as it seems: Meghan’s carefully constructed online image is threatening to fall apart, and when Agatha announces to her ex-boyfriend that she’s pregnant, things really take a darker turn.

In 1972, English writer, cartographer, mathematician, artist and illustrator Tim Robinson upped sticks from his native Yorkshire and moved to the Aran Islands with his wife, Mairead. He quickly “went native”, creating magnificent maps of the local landscape, and chronicling the nature, culture, language and customs of the region. Robinson, a highly respected member of Aosdána and the Royal Irish Academy, wrote several acclaimed books, including his award-winning Connemara trilogy (Listening to the Wind, The Last Pool of Darkness and A Little Gaelic Kingdom). He sadly died in London in April after contracting coronavirus – just two weeks after Mairead’s death. As a tribute to this towering figure in the west of Ireland, TG4 is reshowing Pat Collins’s 2011 documentary on one of Connemara’s most celebrated residents.

2020-06-07|"Many governments are slowly unwinding their economies from nationwide lockdowns. However, re-opening the economy entails a serious trade-off between fostering economic output and keeping the spread of infection low. This column reports several re-opening scenarios for the UK economy, documenting their projected impacts on both GDP and the spread of the virus. The results suggest that it is best to re-open upstream industries first, as they provide a large direct and indirect economic boost at a relatively lower cost in terms of further epidemic spreading.

The economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are large and have affected some industries and occupations more than others (Koren and Peto 2020, del Rio-Chanona et al. 2020). For example, labour supply shocks strongly affected construction, but were absent in sectors considered essential. Yet, given the interconnected nature of the economy, even the sectors shielded from the direct shocks eventually face adverse consequences. First-order shocks are amplified through production networks and the interaction of supply and demand (Inoue and Todo 2020, Barrot et al. 2020, Mandel and Veetil 2020, Bonadio et al. 2020, Baqaee and Farhi, 2020). For instance, in Norway, within a month, two thirds of the layoffs happened in businesses that were not directly hit by the shocks (Alstadsæter et al. 2020).

Governments that are now seeking to re-open their economies cannot ignore these network interactions. To determine the relative economic boosts of different re-opening scenarios, they need to consider the risks of an unbalanced re-opening that may worsen supply chain bottlenecks. Besides, they must also consider that the risk of infection faced by workers varies across industries and search for an appropriate compromise between increasing economic output and controlling the epidemic spreading.

In a recent paper (Pichler et al. 2020), we investigate several scenarios for the phased re-opening of the UK economy by modelling production network effects explicitly. At one extreme, we find that re-opening only a very limited number of industries can create supply chain ‘mis-coordination problems’ that may even decrease aggregate output. At the other extreme, re-opening all industries without extra precautionary measures would increase the epidemic reproduction number (R ) to above one, and may cause a second wave of the epidemic. Our results suggest that there is a reasonable compromise that yields a relatively small increase in epidemic spreading and delivers a substantial boost in economic output.

In an interconnected economy, it is intrinsically difficult to assess the economic impact of re-opening only some industries. Each industry relies on other industries, sometimes critically. For example, the metal manufacturing industry cannot operate without supplies from the mining industry. Opening parts of the economy without considering these relationships could cause severe supply chain disruptions.

We designed a novel economic model that acknowledges the unique features of the current crisis, and specifically (i) deals simultaneously with supply and demand shocks, (ii) allows for sluggish consumption recovery, and (iii) incorporates sectoral inventory buffers. The core of the model is an industrial production network that distinguishes between critical and non-critical inputs. To determine which inputs are critical, we use a survey of IHS Markit industry analysts, who were asked “Can production continue in industry X if input Y is not available for two months?”.

Our model is calibrated to the UK economy and initialised with first-order supply and demand shocks derived in del Rio-Chanona et al. (2020). Validation exercises show that our model is in good agreement with recent estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and is in line with the sectoral unemployment data of the US. Our model predicts a reduction in GDP of 1.7% for the first quarter and a reduction of 21.5% for the second quarter of 2020 (compared to the last quarter of 2019). These estimates are in the range of other forecasts for the UK economy, although on the more pessimistic side.

Figure 1 Simulation results for implementing and unwinding the UK lockdown

As in most economic models, the predicted outcomes depend fairly strongly on the choice of the production function. We assume that non-critical inputs are not necessary (to avoid the unrealistic collapse of the economy that would take place under a standard Leontief model). However, we do assume that critical inputs are absolutely necessary, and in fixed proportion, leading to non-trivial network effects. For instance, we find the counter-intuitive result that re-opening only a few industries can lower aggregate output. This happens because when some sectors of the economy are output-constrained, other industries compete for these scarce inputs. Important industries may then run out of inventory and eventually lack critical inputs to operate.

If re-opening only a handful of selected industries can cause problems, re-opening should be broad enough. However, this can of course be very risky in terms of infections. This prompted us to evaluate the effects of the re-opening scenarios on R , the reproduction number of the epidemic. We decompose the epidemic transmission rate into five sources of infections: infections at the workplace, at school, during consumption activities, during commuting, and finally, infections that are not influenced by whether or not an industry is open. We also estimate the infection risk in each industry. For instance, the healthcare sector is responsible for more work-related infections than the forestry sector. This is because health workers have more contacts, each contact has a higher infection risk, and there are more healthcare than forestry workers overall. As another example, the retail and restaurant sectors contribute much more to consumption infections than the mining sector, because there are virtually no direct consumption activities in the mining industry.

By splitting sources of infection by economic activity, we can assess both the economic and epidemic impact of different scenarios.

We then use this simple epidemic model to study five re-opening scenarios. First, to establish a proper benchmark, we quantify the effect on epidemic spreading if the lockdown continues. Second, we analyse the impact of fully re-opening agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and construction (which were not entirely closed during the UK lockdown). Third, we open all upstream industries but leave all non-essential sectors in consumer-facing industries closed (retail, accommodation and food, recreational and personal services). The fourth scenario is the same as the third but assumes that schools are fully open instead of receiving only children of workers who cannot work from home. In the fifth scenario, we re-open all industries for work and consumption.

Figure 2 shows the economy-epidemic trade-off. There is considerable uncertainty in our predictions, but one conclusion appears robust: A large part of the ‘upstream’ economy (that was closed until recently) tends to have a relatively lower risk for workers, little risk for consumers, and also has higher economic value. Essentially, this is because large parts of manufacturing and business services have high ‘value-added’ and are upstream, meaning that they provide inputs to other industries. Also, these upstream industries are rarely selling directly to consumers, and thus present limited risks in their contribution to the pandemic. As a result, there is a ‘sweet spot’ in which we can re-open upstream industries but leave many consumer-facing industries closed. This results in a relatively small increase in risk of infection and a significant economic boost.

Figure 2 How different re-opening scenarios impact R0 and GDP

Notes: The left-hand vertical axis shows the reproduction number R0 (multi-coloured bars). The right-hand vertical axis gives the share of GDP compared to pre-lockdown levels (blue bars).

As Figure 2 makes clear, the scenario “All except consumer-facing industries” increases the reproduction number only marginally but increases GDP by 8%, relative to lockdown a month after these industries are re-opened. In contrast, re-opening the entire economy only increases GDP by an additional 2%. Thus, our recommended scenario has most of the economic benefits, and only minimal cost in terms of increased infections. Of course, there remains a lot of uncertainty in many estimates, and we cannot be sure that this scenario would not bring R above one. Similarly, we cannot be sure that re-opening completely would bring R above one (if stringent physical distancing and environmental health measures are in place). However, our results do indicate that the cost-benefit ratio of an industry being open is likely to be lower for upstream industries.

2020-06-07|"In and out of lockdowns: Identifying the centrality of economic activities

The effects of the Covid-19 lockdowns have been severe worldwide. Although most activities were reopened in May, Italian GDP is expected to drop by around 10% in 2020. This column argues that a targeted exit from the lockdown in Italy could have been implemented instead. It identifies those activities with the greatest impact on the national economy, but with low risks for those returning to work and for the country at large. The methodology could also be applied in other countries and in the in the unfortunate event of a new wave of contagion and a new lockdown.

The effects of the Covid-related lockdowns are massive (see McKibbin and Fernando 2020). In Italy, we estimate a 44% reduction in the value of potential output produced, peaking at 69% for construction and real estate and 63% for mechanics. Activities were closed following an administrative decision of the government, differently from other countries like Germany or France, where the lockdown was in most cases the indirect effect of social confinement (Barrot et al. 2020, Fadinger and Schymik 2020). As a result, GDP in Italy is expected to drop by around 10% in 2020, according to most forecasts.

In Italy, most activities were reopened in May, although with social distancing and health safety guidelines. In this column, we argue that a targeted exit from the lockdown could have been implemented instead, giving priority to those activities with the greatest impact on the national economy. This targeted strategy, combined with an assessment of the inherent health risks of each activity (as done by the government), would have reduced the risks of a second wave of contagion for those returning to work and for the country at large, while achieving a reactivation of gross output and jobs similar to the general reopening actually implemented.

In a recent paper (Barba Navaretti et al. 2020), we propose an approach to identify production activities for which total or partial closures (and consequently reopening) would have the greatest impact on the country's GDP, output, and employment, using input-output tables and network centrality measures in production chains. Our approach provides an operative tool for clearly identifying the economic effects of lockdowns at a granular level. We show, for example, that the activation of just 20 core micro-sectors would raise the capacity of the Italian economy, as measured by the value of gross output, from 56% (under the administrative lockdown as of 4 May) to 76%, with respect to the pre-Covid-19 level. The impact would be especially sizeable in core production chains. For instance, the value of gross output of mechanics would increase from 37% to 84% and of constructions from 31% to 77%. We estimate that the administrative lockdown, as of 4 May, if kept for an entire year, would have implied a drop in GDP of 52%. The reopening of the sectors identified in our analysis would limit this fall to 16% (assuming the other activities remain closed for a whole year).

Understanding how to minimise the impact of the lockdown on the economy is of course important to design the re-opening strategy, but it is even more crucial in the event of having to face a possible resurgence of the Covid-19 pandemic or a new pandemic in the future. We all wish these events would never happen, but the main lesson from these tragic months is that we can no longer be unprepared in confronting them.

Identifying core sectors of the economy is not easy, because size is not the only issue. Given the tangled nature of value chains, there are activities that may seem insignificant from a quantitative point of view, but are fundamental links in several production chains, and therefore have a significant indirect impact on the production capacity of the country. Input-output (IO) tables are the starting point to unfold the interconnections among different sectors of activity. A parallel strand of analysis, closer to the business and management literature, has developed from the concept of production or supply chains, building on the seminal contribution of Porter (1985). We merge these two strands of the literature, integrating information from the IO matrices of the Italian economy (produced by Istat), with those from the structure of the value chains of the Italian economy, built by Prometeia. In our analysis, we exploit two sets of analytical tools that have been developed in the recent years: the methodology to extract some sectors of economic activities from IO matrices proposed by Dietzenbacher and Lahr (2013), and the techniques used by social network analysis to identify key players within a system (Jackson 2010).

The tangled web of the economy

To disentangle the intricacies of the Italian economy we move in three steps.

First, among the 63 sectors of the national IO tables , we identify those in which closure causes the largest drop of GDP, thus simulating the effect of their total or partial lockdown as implemented by the government decrees of 22 March and 10 April (Dietzenbacher and Lahr 2013).

Table 1 below lists the sectors for which a yearly closure (as of Italy’s Prime Minister Decrees of 22 March and 10 April 2020) would have an impact on GDP greater than 3%.

Table 1 Impact of one year of administrative lockdown on GDP by industry, as of IO tables

Notes: The table reports the estimates of the drop in GDP caused by the lockdown of a sector’s economic activities as of Italy’s Prime Minister Decrees of 22 March and 10 April 2020, if kept for an entire year. Only sectors with an estimated drop larger than 3% of GDP are listed.

The size of the decline in GDP can be decomposed into three factors: (i) the size of the sector, (ii) the degree of interconnection between the sector and other upstream and downstream sectors, and (iii) the degree of closure of the sector imposed by the Ministerial Decrees (i.e. the larger the extent of the lockdown, the larger the economic impact).

The sectors identified at NACE 2 digits are large and made of heterogeneous activities. At the same time, activities which are relatively small and have small weights in input-output tables may provide crucial inputs or crucial outlets to more than one production chain. Hence their closure may nevertheless endanger a large share of national output. This effect would not be detected by input-output table.

For this reason, as our second step, we revert to finer industry statistics, and also to the analysis of specific production chains.

Our units of analysis are the 192 micro-sectors included in production chains. We focus on those included in the core NACE 2 digits sectors identified above in Table 1. We use social network analysis to study the links among each micro-sector and identify the most central ones within and between production chains.

The literature on social networks has proposed several measures to characterise the relevance of each node in addition to the number of connections. We choose eigenvector centrality, which estimates the relative relevance of a node within a network. Micro-sectors with a higher eigenvector centrality, therefore, are more relevant within each production chain and across a larger number of production chains.

Figure 1 provides a representation of our network. Each dot represents a micro-sector, with its size proportional to its eigenvector centrality. The ‘tails’ in the picture represent production chains and their dots correspond to micro-sectors which only belong to a single production chain, therefore having lower centrality values. Dots in the centre represent micro-sectors with high centrality values because they interact with many micro-sectors across different production chains (e.g. wholesalers of intermediate industrial goods).

The micro-sectors are then ranked according to their eigenvector centrality. We have identified three groups of micro-sectors. A first group includes the 20 most central micro-sectors, with a total value of production when fully open of over €820 billion (23% of the total production of the Italian economy). As of 4 May, these micro-sectors were operating at a mere 13% of their potential output. Of the approximately four million people employed before the crisis, just over half a million were at work on 4 May. If these 20 micro-sectors were allowed to operate at full capacity, the total value of output of the Italian economy would rise from 56% of its potential to as much 76%.

Nonetheless, while inspecting production chains, one immediately realises that in some of them (e.g. fashion) many core activities, such as clothing and footwear, would still remain closed, making the opening up of the identified micro-sectors ineffective for these production chains. We therefore consider a second set of the next 20 micro-sectors in terms of centrality, which are less central than the initial 20, but still large and with a crucial role in core production chains.

Finally, by combining information on the centrality of the network with qualitative assessments regarding the articulation of the individual production chains, one can also identify ten additional micro-sectors. Since they are relatively small, accounting for only 3.9% of total production, they cannot be identified by our procedure. Yet they are crucial enablers of entire production chains (e.g. packaging paper for the food industry or textile finishing in fashion).

Table 2 reports output capacity for each production chain (measured as gross value of output) compared to pre Covid levels, under four scenarios: the administrative lockdown as of 4 May (only essential activities are allowed - column 1) and following the opening up of the core 20 (column 2), 40 (column 3), and 50 (column 4) micro-sectors.

With just 50 micro-sectors operating at full capacity in addition to those deemed essential, out of a total number of 192, production chains such as Agrifood, Media"|0
2020-06-07|"The Office of the Basic Education Commission (Obec) on Saturday promised students entering Mathayom 1 and Mathayom 4 levels will have seats at some schools for the new semester despite national examinations being delayed for more than two months because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

""Parents of students who fail the exams and cannot get into the schools they wanted can contact Obec offices in their areas. Obec will find seats for these students so they can go to a new school on July 1,"" Amnat Wichayanuwat, Obec's secretary-general said yesterday after inspecting an examination room arrangement at Bodindecha (Sing Singhaseni) School in Bangkok.

Examinations for obtaining places in state schools for Mathayom 1 and Mathayom 4 were arranged over the weekend after a two-month delay caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Mr Amnat said Obec has tested a system of on-air and online education from May 18 to June 30 in schools before they reopen on July 1.

He said he had sent health plans to be implemented at schools to the government's Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) for approval. In the meantime, Obec has trained teachers and schools how to teach remotely to prevent the spread of Covid-19 among students.

""Obec expects that students will return to study at schools,"" Mr Amnat said. ""We give priority to how schools manage social distancing in classrooms. However, we also prepared online education infrastructure as a backup system.""

Teachers at state schools across the country have conducted test runs for online teaching from May 18.

He said state schools nationwide have been ordered to prepare social distancing measures for schools opening on July 1.

Under the ""new normal"", schools must arrange seats in classrooms and canteens that enable students to sit 1.5 metres to 2 metres apart, air conditioning is banned, and face shields and hand gels must be provided.

Mr Amnat and Khunying Kalaya Sophonpanich, deputy education mister, yesterday visited the entrance exams at Bodindecha (Sing Singhaseni) School to inspect sanitation and arrangements to manage any overcrowding.

2020-06-06|"At daybreak on Saturday, Charles Shay stood lonesome without any fellow veteran on the very same beach where he waded ashore 76 years ago, part of one of the most epic battles in military history that came to be known as D-Day and turned the tide of the Second World War.

Compared to last year, when many tens of thousands came to the northern French beaches of Normandy to cheer the dwindling number of veterans and celebrate three-quarters of a century of liberation from Nazi oppression, the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restrictions turned this year's remembrance into one of the eeriest ever.

""I am very sad now,"" said Shay, who was a 19-year-old U.S. Army medic when he landed on Omaha Beach under horrific machine-gun fire and shells. ""Because of the virus, nobody can be here. I would like to see more of us here,"" he told The Associated Press.

Normally, 95-year-old Shay would be meeting other survivors of the 1944 battle and celebrating with locals and dignitaries alike, all not far from his home close to the beaches that defined his life.

""This year, I am one of the very few that is probably here,"" he said, adding that other U.S. veterans could not fly in because of the pandemic.

When a full moon disappeared over land and the sun rose the other side over the English Channel, there was no customary rumble of columns of vintage jeep and trucks to be heard, roads still so deserted hare sat alongside them.

Still the French would not let this day slip by unnoticed, such is their attachment to some 160,000 soldiers from the United States, Britain, Canada and other countries who spilled their blood to free foreign beaches and fight on to finally defeat Nazism almost one year later.

""It's a June 6 unlike any other,"" said Philippe Laillier, the mayor of Saint-Laurent-Sur-Mer, who staged a small remembrance around the Omaha Beach monument. ""

But still we had to do something. We had to mark it.""

The moment the sun broke over the ocean, the Omaha Beach theme from the film Saving Private Ryan blared across the sand for a few dozen locals and visitors dressed in vintage clothing.

The pandemic has wreaked havoc across the world, infecting more than six million people, killing over 391,000 and devastating economies. It poses a particular threat to the elderly — like the surviving D-Day veterans who are in their late nineties or older.

It has also affected the younger generations who turn out every year to mark the occasion. Most have been barred from travelling to the windswept coasts of Normandy.

The lack of a big international crowd was palpable.

In the afternoon, a flyover of French fighter jets leaving a trail of the national colours was reminiscent of the one U.S. President Donald Trump and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron watched from Colleville last year. This time, though, only a sparse crowd craned necks upward.

At the American cemetery on a bluff overseeing Omaha Beach, Shay went to pay his respects to over 9,000 servicemen, and again was the lone U.S. veteran at an intimate ceremony.

U.S. President Harry Truman's quote, ""America will never forget their sacrifices,"" is etched into the cemetery's Orientation Pavilion.

With Americans unable to come over to Normandy this year, the French proved to be trustworthy alternates in fulfilling Truman's vow.

Ivan Thierry, 62, a local fisherman who catches sea bass around the wrecks that still litter the seabed nearby, was holding an American flag in tribute even before dawn.

""There is not nobody here. Even if we are only a dozen, we are here to commemorate,"" he said."|0

The Central Districts apprentice has been riding since before she can remember, and she is pleased to be following in her forebearers' footsteps.

“My granddad, Arnold Taiaroa, he was a jockey, as well as my dad (Evan), he is riding amateurs at the moment,” Taiaroa said.

“I have been riding ponies since I could walk. Mum and dad started off in Levin and I mucked out boxes when I was younger and I have just kept going. I just want to follow in my granddad and dad’s footsteps.”

While she has always enjoyed riding and being around horses, it was a horse called Fred that got Taiaroa hooked on a career in the irons.

“I started riding track work at about 12 and that was on a trotting track on an old horse called Fred, for Jack Scott.

“Back then I thought they were pulling, but now looking back on it I just wasn’t strong enough.”

Taiaroa is into her third season of riding, and like most young New Zealand jockeys, aspires to ride in Group One features across the Tasman.

“I would definitely like to ride some Group One winners and to ride in a Melbourne Cup one day.”

While Taiaroa dreams of one day riding at Flemington on the first Tuesday in November, she was content to be back riding at the trials at Foxton on Thursday, despite the wet conditions.

It was a successful day for the 18-year-old hoop, who kicked home three heat winners, including two for employer Kevin Gray.

“It’s definitely good to be back at the trials. It was a good comeback and I had a good blowout,” Taiaroa said.

“It was very wet, coming to the last heat it was nearly a Heavy11 I reckon.

“Floral Belt went very well, I was happy with her, Satin Belt was very good as well and had a good blow, and Leighs Mate finished off very strong.”

With Gray having his own private training property, Taiaroa said she was one of the lucky few jockeys who were able to maintain their fitness and continue riding over the Covid-19 lockdown.

Taiaroa has been pleased with the way her riding has progressed this term, and she is hoping to add to her 15-win tally in the last month of the remaining season.

“I’m very happy with the way things were going with 15 wins. Hopefully this winter will be very good.”

Taiaroa highlighted Credit Manager’s win over 1400m at Trentham on Wellington Cup day as a clear highlight, and she is looking forward to being reunited with the four-year-old gelding this coming season."|2

The anti-racism rally started at Victoria Park with protestors marching through Clarence Street and Wellington at 3 p.m, and ended shorty after 6 p.m on Richmond Street.

“When we are walking and we see a cop our heart just starts beating,” said Kwasi Ofosu, a protestor who was marching with his younger brother.

“What is going to happen to us, why is my heart beating, they’re [police] supposed to be protecting us not trying to destroy us or make us feel not worthy of ourselves,” says Ofosu.

The protest was peaceful except for one moment where a small group of people tried to disrupt the crowds.

The response from those involved in the march, “No violence, do not retaliate.”

The group was forced out of Victoria Park without any reported injuries.

The spokesperson of the London Black Lives Matter rally, Alexandra Kane, says the rally was in preparation for months but the message of inequality and police brutality against black people goes back centuries.

“[Racism] exists right here in London it affects me all the time,” Kane says.

“It affects me when I want to apply for a job, it affects how people view me when I cross the street…it’s starting to affect my son who is a little boy who is one-years-old and has already had racial epitaphs thrown at him,” Kane said.

Some members from London police were present at the rally but mostly stuck to the sidelines as a preventative measure.

“The London police service is committed to a safe and secure community and right now we do recognize a person’s right to freedom of expression and opinion,” said Const. Sandasha Bough.

“Our job is to make sure that it is being done safely today.”

Most people wore masks and gloves at the rally but there are criticisms surrounding the large gathering due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mayor of London Ed Holder told CTV News that he supports the Black Lives Matter message but would be attending the rally online in order to practice physical distancing measures.

The medical officer of health for Middlesex-London Health Unit, Dr. Chris Mackie, did in fact attend the rally, but he stayed inside his car.

Kane says she understands why some people did not show up and respects their choice because of the risks of spreading COVID-19, but adds that racism is a pandemic in itself.

“Movement is greater than anything I could imagine. I think we joined the world in what we are feeling and our passion and our motivation. This intensity in the air speaks volumes, this can’t happen anymore, I’m so glad we are here and able to join the world and say, ‘Black Lives Matter.’”"|1
2020-06-08|"SOME MIGHT dispute whether America remains the “indispensable nation”, a phrase deployed in 1998 by Madeleine Albright, then the country’s secretary of state. But it is certainly still the nation that cannot be ignored, the one that, in a sense, sets the political weather globally. So when it goes through a trauma as it has since the killing by the police of George Floyd, the impact is felt worldwide. Mr Floyd’s death has provoked popular protests in dozens of countries; it has also been an opportunity for gloating from the governments of America’s foes and rivals, and has been an embarrassment for its friends and allies.

This past weekend saw hundreds of protests not just in America, but around the world. On Saturday in Parliament Square in London, the largest of many demonstrations in Britain, tens of thousands of people braved chilly squalls and the risk of covid-19, which had led government ministers to call for protests to be shunned. They shouted Mr Floyd’s name, chanted “Black Lives Matter” and, every now and then, dropped to one knee with one clenched fist raised skyward. The crowd, overwhelmingly young and racially mixed, mostly wore masks but paid no attention to social-distancing constraints. Many regarded the danger posed by the virus as proof of their commitment to the anti-racist cause. Their parents or grandparents might have been hurt or arrested in the battle outside the American embassy that followed a protest against the Vietnam war in March 1968. But they too, in their own eyes at least, were putting themselves on the line.

They were protesting against not just violence by the American police, or President Donald Trump’s handling of the unrest, but against racism at home. Many placards listed names of black victims of police violence in Britain, such as Mark Duggan, a 29-year-old whose shooting by the police in London in 2011 sparked widespread rioting. They also recalled the victims of other crimes whose perpetrators had not been brought to justice, such as Belly Mujinga, a railway worker who died of covid-19, allegedly after being spat at by a carrier of the virus.

In other countries, too, George Floyd’s murder has resurrected old worries about the justice system’s treatment of ethnic minorities. In France, for example, protesters remembered Adama Traoré, a young Frenchman of Malian descent who died in police custody in 2016. And Brazil on Sunday saw nationwide marches against President Jair Bolsonaro and police violence against black people, including the accidental killing of a 14-year-old in Rio de Janeiro on May 18th.

Elsewhere representatives of entire communities have drawn parallels between their plight and that of African-Americans. Palestinians saw echoes of George Floyd’s fate in the shooting by police in Jerusalem on May 30th of Iyad Halak, a 32-year-old with severe autism, who was apparently mistaken for somebody else. In Australia, Aboriginal activists pointed out that more than 400 indigenous people have died in police custody since 1991, when a commission of inquiry, held to investigate the problem, made hundreds of recommendations to promote reconciliation between Aboriginal and other Australians. The “Black Lives Matter” slogan has been adopted in Indonesia by indigenous people in the provinces of Papua and West Papua. Darker-skinned than many Indonesians, many Papuans complain of widespread discrimination, and hanker after independence.

That no country is entirely free of racism and discrimination may have restrained some politicians from commenting on America’s problems. Its strongest critics, however, showed no such reticence. After all, American leaders rarely pull their punches.

China in particular relished accusing America of hypocrisy. The timing was poignant. On May 28th China’s parliament rubber-stamped a proposal to impose a security law on Hong Kong that America insisted robbed the territory of the autonomy it was promised. June 4th marked the anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre in 1989. Mike Pompeo, America’s secretary of state, undeterred by the irony that America now appeared far more likely than China to deploy armoured vehicles against peaceful protesters in its national capital, observed the date by meeting veterans of China’s democracy movement. Hu Xijin, editor of Global Times, a tub-thumping party-controlled tabloid, clearly enjoyed drawing attention to these coincidences. On Twitter, he called on Mr Pompeo to “stand with the angry people of Minneapolis, just like you did with people of Hong Kong”.

Iran’s leaders have been milking America’s predicament for all it is worth. “A cop kneeling on a black man’s neck and letting him choke to death...is the nature of the American government. They have done the same to such countries as Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria,"" said Ayatollah Khamenei, the country’s supreme leader, in a televised speech. Authoritarian leaders elsewhere—in Russia and Turkey, for example—have similarly jumped to criticise America, and, by implication, try to vindicate their own repression. Even North Korea, by many assessments the world’s most thuggish and despotic regime, tried to seize the moral high ground. “Demonstrators enraged by the extreme racists throng even to the White House. This is the reality in the US today,” claimed a spokesman quoted in the ruling-party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun.

America’s friends and allies, by contrast, have found themselves in a tight spot. Few want to antagonise America, or Mr Trump. So many have sought refuge in keeping their mouths shut. Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, for example, has been uncharacteristically taciturn on the issue. And Justin Trudeau, his Canadian counterpart, responded to a question about Mr Trump’s handling of recent events with more than 20 seconds of eloquent silence, before beginning his answer: “We all watch in horror and consternation what’s going on in the United States...”, before turning to racism and inequality in Canada.

On the other hand, the pressure from the streets means that Western leaders cannot ignore racism either in America or at home. A young generation for whom this has become, along with climate change and sexual inequality, one of the big political issues will force an examination of many national blindspots. In the British port city of Bristol, for example, protesters toppled a statue of Edward Colston, a 17th-century slave-trader, and heaved it into a canal. And in the Netherlands, the prime minister, Mark Rutte, said he had changed his mind about his previous defence of the “Zwarte Piet” tradition cherished by many Dutch people: when Santa Claus visits the country each December, he is accompanied by “black Petes”, helpers played by children or adults dressed up in blackface, big red lips and curly wigs.

The pandemic has marked a pause in the wave of unco-ordinated but simultaneous protest movements that crossed much of the world last year. They seem to be resuming, starting in America. Its position as the sole superpower may be under threat. But its political agonies still sway opinion around the world.■"|1

2020-06-08|"Despite being a far less mobile population, immigrants never seem to be able to leave behind the mantle of “foreigner.” Right-wing advocates, based on little but poorly-disguised racism, use pandemics and other disruptions to the international order (like terror attacks) as evidence of the dangers of immigration. Their narratives disregard that immigrants overwhelmingly make up a country’s essential workforce. Such fear-mongering escalates xenophobia already percolating in society. Popular media and political discourse link immigrants to dangers unfolding in faraway lands, highlighting the “foreign-ness” of immigrants and their descendants. Immigrants consequently become depicted as internal threats. This holds true even when immigrants are not from or have never visited the places where the threats originate (I expound on this subject in my book Here, There, and Elsewhere: The Making of Immigrant Identities in a Globalized World).

Many segments of the American public blamed Latinos for Zika, and African immigrants for Ebola, regardless of which South American or African countries the immigrants came from. Today, the COVID-19 crisis, having originated in China, is feeding into pre-existing anti-Chinese racism. This is despite the fact that the virus that led to the outbreak in New York, which has the largest U.S. death toll, came from Europe. Hate-crimes against those perceived as Chinese has similarly risen in Canada."|1
2020-06-08|"Socioeconomic determinants of Covid-19 infections and mortality: Evidence from England and Wales

Targeting policy responses to Covid- 19 appropriately is important but requires information such as which groups in society are most affected by the pandemic. This column uses data on Covid-19 infections and mortality for small local areas in England and Wales to study the link of Covid-19 with socioeconomic factors. The findings suggest that areas with larger households, worse levels of self-reported health and a larger fraction of people using public transport have higher infection rates. Areas with an older population, a larger black or Asian population and worse levels of self-reported health have higher mortality rates. Particular attention should hence be paid to reducing the risk of infection on public transport when relaxing lockdown measures.

There is wide variation in Covid-19 infection rates and mortality rates across England and Wales. The local authority with the highest infection rate in early May 2020 was Barrow-in-Furness in the northwest, with over 800 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people. Nearby Lancaster and South Lakeland as well as the North East region around Gateshead, Sunderland and South Tyneside were further hotspots. Wales also has very high infection rates, but this is mostly due to a higher frequency of testing compared to England.

The picture is different for mortality rates. As of 24 April 2020, the local authority with the highest mortality rate was Hertsmere in Hertfordshire, with 131 deaths per 100,000 people. The neighbouring north London boroughs of Harrow, Barnet and Enfield also had high mortality rates. Out of the 10 local authorities with the highest mortality, six are in Greater London.

Health, ethnicity, household size and use of public transport matter

Two studies for New York City (Borjas 2020, Almagro and Orane-Hutchinson 2020) examine the correlation between Covid-19 infections and socioeconomic variables and find that infection rates are higher in zip codes with a larger black population, with on average larger households and with more people working in occupations with a high degree of human interaction.

I use simple correlation and regression analysis to examine this question in England and Wales, looking not only at infections but also at mortality (Sá 2020). Data on the number of deaths that mention Covid-19 on the death certificate are available from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) at a fine level of geographic disaggregation (over 7,000 Middle Layer Super Output Areas). This allows me to include local authority fixed effects in the analysis, capturing local characteristics that have not been included in the model. I find that local areas that have larger households, worse levels of self-reported health and a larger fraction of people using public transport have more Covid-19 infections per 100,000 people. For mortality, household size and use of public transport are less important, but there is a clear relation with age, ethnicity and self-reported health. Local areas with an older population, a larger black or Asian population and worse levels of self-reported health have more Covid-19 deaths per 100,000 people.

Some of these socioeconomic factors were highlighted by Aron and Muellbauer (2020), who note that the number of excess deaths in London – measured as the number of deaths relative to the average number of deaths in the same period in the past five years – increased ahead of other regions, probably due to high population density and a crowded public transport system which make it difficult to social distance. Overman (2020) points out that the economic impacts of Covid-19 are likely to be unequal across different areas of the UK, affecting especially areas where workers cannot easily work from home.

The relation between self-reported health and infections and mortality suggests that encouraging a healthy lifestyle can help prevent the spread of infections and reduce mortality. Also, as many countries now begin to relax lockdown measures, policymakers should pay particular attention to reducing the risk of infection in public transport. This can be done by encouraging people to use other forms of transport, as is being done in the UK, but also by increasing the frequency of services to avoid overcrowding. Businesses should also take the risk of infection in public transport into account when deciding how to get their employees back to the office. Working from home should continue to be encouraged when possible, especially for those who have to travel to work by public transport. This is particularly relevant in London, where more than half of employed workers travel to work by public transport, compared with a national average of 13%.

2020-06-08|"Contact-tracing and risk-tracing technologies could help ease the ‘health–wealth trade-off’ confronting many countries in the wake of COVID-19. But privacy and security concerns are preventing such technologies from being widely adopted. This column suggests a way to ease those concerns by endowing individuals with property rights to the digital information that concerns them. A ‘self-sovereign identity system’ could assure users that their data would be exploited only for specified purposes, such as containing a pandemic. The data would revert to being private property once the pandemic is over.

At present, countries around the world face a terrible trade-off between a health crisis and an economic crisis, which can be called the ‘health–wealth trade-off’. To avoid the health crisis, many countries have implemented lockdowns, which generate an enormous economic cost in terms of lost income and output (e.g. Portes 2020). This trade-off could be eased substantially through contact tracing, risk tracing, testing, isolating, and treatment.

‘Contact tracing’ involves identifying people who may have come into contact, directly or indirectly, with an infected person. The contacts of infected people can then be tested for infection; those infected can be isolated and treated; their contacts can be traced, and so on (Galeotti et al. 2020). Implementing contact-tracing would greatly reduce the need for social distancing, particularly if contact-tracing were supplemented by ‘risk tracing’, which involves dividing people into risk categories on the basis of readily available information, such as age, occupation, residence, workplace, and pre-existing health conditions (Mesnard and Seabright 2020). The effectiveness of contact- and risk-tracing can be enhanced significantly through the application of AI technologies in areas such as early warnings, tracking and prediction, visualisation, diagnosis and prognosis, monitoring crowds, and treatment support (e.g. Vaishya et al. 2020).

If AI-enhanced contact and risk tracing were implemented, social distancing would be necessary primarily for people who have not been tested and are in high-risk categories. Consequently, the health–wealth trade-off would be vastly improved because it would no longer be necessary for countries to send most of their residents into lockdown. Many people would return to work, with social distancing regulations becoming more stringent for the more vulnerable groups.

For countries where contact and risk tracing is feasible, people are generally willing to provide the requisite data in return for protection from infection, with three provisos: that others do the same, that their data are used only for the purpose of containing the pandemic, and that their data are adequately protected from hacking and malicious use. The great interest in providing data in return for health security is exemplified by the widespread attention and positive response PwC has received for its plans to deploy an Automatic Contact Tracing check-in app for its employees, also to be made available to its clients (e.g. Leswing 2020).1 Other companies, such as Locix and Microshare, are working on tools permitting not only people but the surfaces with which infected people have come into contact to be retraced. Such initiatives will help companies reopen operations after lockdown by ensuring employees’ workplace safety. Though contact tracing at the workplace is certainly welcome, it is far less effective than systems providing comprehensive contact tracing throughout time and space.

In order for contact and risk tracing to become manageable in countries with significant infection rates, it needs to be done automatically through digital technologies rather than through personal interviews. Apple and Google have partnered to assist in contact-tracing through a system that includes application programming interfaces (APIs) and operating system-level technology. These companies also plan to offer a Bluetooth-based contact-tracing platform “that would allow more individuals to participate, if they choose to opt in, as well as enable interaction with a broader ecosystem of apps and government health authorities” (Government Technology 2020). The opt-in condition is meant to overcome privacy and security concerns. As Apple and Google emphasise, “privacy, transparency and consent are of utmost importance in this effort” (Apple 2020).

But the opt-in condition is expected to limit severely the uptake of this system.2 Opt-in policies produce far lower participation rates than opt-out policies in a wide variety of settings, from organ donations to pensions. This is so for a variety of well-known reasons: changing the default requires mental effort; the default is usually considered the preferable or acceptable choice; and people are more sensitive to losses than to gains relative to the default, making them more likely to retain the default. Governments and businesses are increasingly using opt-out design to promote socially desirable outcomes in many domains though not, as noted, in pandemic containment (e.g. Johnson and Goldstein 2003, Sunstein 2017, Thaler and Sunstein 2008).

Needless to say, contact tracing software is effective only when it is widely deployed. The system only has a high chance of detecting when a person in the system has been in contact with an infected person if a large proportion of the population has signal-emitting devices. Thus, the Apple-Google contact-tracing system is widely deemed unlikely to play a major role in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic in many Western countries.

The opt-in policy of Apple and Google with respect to their contact-tracing app stands in stark contrast to their standard policy with regard to the use of private data for advertising purposes, as well as derivative digital strategies designed to attract user attention. In practice, smartphones can be understood as surveillance devices, used by digital network providers (such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and others) to target advertising individually to users. These users implicitly consent to this surveillance by agreeing to the digital services’ terms and conditions, which they rarely attempt to read and which they would be unable to read (with all hyperlinks to other relevant documents) even if they wished to, due to the time and effort required.3 In some cases, users have the possibility of opting out of some surveillance, but often in return for significant loss of service.

Currently, most people are highly sensitive to the potential misuse of their data with regard to contact tracing, but remain largely unaware that their smartphones are de facto surveillance devices for advertising and attention-capturing purposes. Since the digital network providers earn their incomes from pursuing these purposes, they have a natural incentive to keep this asymmetric awareness intact. Apple, Google, and other digital network providers’ sensitivity to privacy and security concerns in contact tracing is understandable.

Because policymakers are often afflicted with the same asymmetric awareness, or are unwilling to address the problem of surveillance for advertising openly, the central questions concerning the future of contact and risk tracing are never asked. How can users be given the opportunity to share information for containing the pandemic while safeguarding their privacy and security? Can the degree of surveillance that is standard for advertising also be applied to saving lives?

To address these questions productively, we need to think beyond the existing institutional framework. The critical insight is simple: the current obstacles to trustworthy information sharing arise from a fundamental misallocation of digital property rights. In the current digital world, users generally do not have property rights to the data about them, not even to the data that they generate about themselves. This data usually belongs to digital network providers, such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. Users are free to leave these networks, but information about users remains in the hands of the networks.4

In the absence of individual digital property rights, it is not surprising that users are highly concerned about the privacy and security of their data. Living in a world in which much of the data about themselves are not in their own hands, they are understandably worried about the possibility of making these data available to a new set of decision makers, including government agencies fighting the pandemic. After all, it is difficult to assure them that data which do not belong to them will not be used by third parties for other purposes.

The straightforward way of tackling this problem is to give users residual property rights to the digital information about them. This solution is feasible and implementable. People can be made ‘sovereign’ over their digital identities (i.e. the information representing them) by implementing a ‘self-sovereign identity system’ whose properties have been well-explored (Der et al. 2017, Tobin and Reed 2017; the economic implications of a self-sovereign identity system are described in Snower 2018). In such a system, each person is given a private digital key to certified, encrypted data about himself or herself for a potentially unlimited number of recipients who can access the data, provided that they have the corresponding public key. The system can be implemented through distributed ledger applications (such as blockchain) and smart contracts (e.g. Jacobovitz 2016, Meitinger 2017). These applications permit search for decentralised identifiers without centralised directory, so that data can be authenticated with decentralised, verifiable credentials. Digital identities need to be persistent, portable, interoperable, and secure (see Allen 2016 for a more detailed description of these requirements). Then each person can choose what inf"|0

2020-06-08|"The German administration has just released their €130 billion economic stimulus package, the most prominent measure of which is an unconventional fiscal policy in the form of a sudden drop in VAT. The aim is to create a future path of increasing sales taxes by increasing prices and hence stimulating inflation expectations and aggregate demand today. This column argues that earlier episodes have shown that unconventional policy is effective because it is easily understood by non-expert households and households react to it strongly. Alternative unconventional measures, instead, such as forward guidance, are largely ineffective in part because households do not understand what such policies imply for their consumption.

As many economies are planning a slow reopening after the COVID-19 containment measures, the question of how to jumpstart the economy and stimulate aggregate demand has taken centre stage (Furman 2020). When conventional monetary policy is constrained and high debt burdens limit the scope of conventional fiscal policy, unconventional policies enter the policy toolbox.

On 3 June 2020, the German government released the measures that will constitute an unprecedented €130 billion stimulus plan. The most unexpected and prominent measure is a form of unconventional fiscal policy (Feldstein 2002, D’Acunto et al. 2016, 2018), whereby the government changes VAT rates to create a future path of increasing sales taxes and hence stimulate inflation expectations and spending at impact. Germany will implement an unexpected, sudden, and temporary drop in VAT, starting in July 2020 until the end of 2020, which will increase households’ expected inflation for 2021 and hence should stimulate spending for the rest of 2020, until prices increase again. The same exact effect could also be obtained by pre-announcing a future increase in VAT, without first cutting the tax. Both measures incentivise households to move their spending forward as long as VAT is lower, although the measures differ in terms of implications for government budgets.

Unconventional fiscal policy is part of a set of non-conventional policies designed and implemented to tackle the main conundrum of the euro area since the Great Recession: stimulating inflation expectations and ultimately aggregate demand in a setting in which traditional monetary policy measures are not viable, and governments can barely support growth with fiscal spending because of their large debt-to-GDP ratios. Another popular unconventional policy that has entered the standard toolbox of many central banks is forward guidance – central banks’ explicit commitment to keep interest rates low until after the end of a liquidity trap, which will generate inflation then and hence should increase inflation expectations today.

In theory, unconventional fiscal policy and forward guidance act through the same channels. They both aim to increase households’ inflation expectations in times in which the effective lower bound on nominal rates binds, and hence changes in inflation expectations should translate one-to-one into changes in perceived real rates by households. Because households perceive lower real interest rates, their incentives to save decline and their willingness to consume should increase based on the consumer Euler equation. These channels are unconventional in the sense that policymakers aim to manage households’ behaviour directly, as opposed to changing the incentives of financial intermediaries and firms and transmitting policy measures indirectly to households.

Despite the same theoretical channels, in the aggregate, forward guidance seems to have been ineffective (Del Negro et al. 2015), and only scant evidence exists to assess the effectiveness of unconventional fiscal policy (D’Acunto et al. 2019). Given the prominence of these measures to jump start the economy after the COVID-19 crisis, in this column, we discuss whether any of these policies appears to have been successful using the same identical microdata and surveys for both policy measures.

Figure 1 reports the central findings in D’Acunto et al. (2020) using data from the harmonised European Commission Consumer Confidence survey for Germany. The figure compares German households’ reaction to a measure of unconventional fiscal policy in 2005 and two forward guidance announcements in 2013-2014.

Figure 1 Inflation expectations and readiness to spend on durables: German households

The top panels report the fraction of the German population expecting higher inflation over the following 12 months; the bottom panels report their average willingness to purchase durable goods. The left panels plot these measures for the unconventional fiscal policy episode. In November 2005, the German government unexpectedly announced a rise in VAT from 16% to 19%, but the increase was only effective in January 2007 and hence, the government engineered a path of future price increases. The right panels plot these measures for the first two explicit forward guidance announcements by former ECB President Draghi in July 2013 and January 2014.

Although theoretically both policies should raise households' inflation expectations and spending on impact, only unconventional fiscal policy has produced these outcomes in the micro data. Forward guidance announcements do not appear to manage expectations or spending plans. The raw data time-series evidence in Figure 1 is interesting, but any unobserved shock contemporaneous to the policy announcements could explain those dynamics.

Methodologically, we need a scientific approach that helps reduce the endogeneity concerns inherent to these policy measures. We propose an identification strategy in the spirit of Poterba (1996), in which other EU consumers not exposed directly to the German VAT shock and/or to the ECB measures of forward guidance act as counterfactual for the behaviour of Germans had the policy announcements not happened. Because different households with different demographics react differently to changes in inflation expectations (Bachmann et al. 2015), we match German households to similar foreign households based on observables. Moreover, our data allow us to control directly for important determinants of spending plans, such as households' income expectations, financial outlook, employment status, and housing choices.

Figure 2 plots the average treatment effect (ATE) of the unconventional fiscal policy announcement on durable purchases (top panel) and of forward guidance (bottom panel). We find no differences in the readiness to spend on durable goods between German and matched households before the announcement of the VAT change. Starting in December 2005, after the future VAT change was announced, German households' willingness to spend increased relative to matched households: German households were 3.8 percentage points more likely to declare it was a good time to purchase durable goods after the announcement relative to before and to matched foreign households. The effect increased in magnitude throughout 2006 and peaked at 34 percentage points in November 2006. The average treatment effect dropped to zero in January 2007 once the VAT increased and higher inflation materialised.

For forward guidance, instead, we find no difference in the readiness to spend on durable goods between German and matched households before the first forward guidance announcement in July 2013. Germans' propensity to spend did not change after the first forward guidance announcement relative to before and relative to matched foreign households. Even around the second announcement in January 2014, the announcement had no effect on the willingness to spend. The propensity to spend did not move after the second announcement either. Ultimately, forward guidance announcements had no effect on impact nor delayed indirect effects through financial intermediaries, such as due to an effect of lower long-term interest rates on credit-financed consumption.

Given the novelty of unconventional fiscal policy, we now discuss in more detail its features and intellectual background. Feldstein (2002) introduced the notion of unconventional fiscal policy measures at times of liquidity traps. Among several possible interventions, he proposed a series of pre-announced increases in VAT to generate consumer price inflation, and hence increase private spending via intertemporal substitution. In his words: “This [VAT] tax-induced inflation would give households an incentive to spend sooner rather than waiting until prices are substantially higher.” The intuition for this proposal is based on a simple logic: announcing higher prices in the future – either with a sudden but temporary cut, or with an outright future increase in VAT – will increase current inflation expectations. Higher inflation expectations at times of fixed nominal interest rates should reduce real interest rates (Fisher equation), and lower real interest rates should increase households’ incentives to consume rather than save (Euler equation). Because imposing higher VAT reduces households’ wealth (especially poorer households’ wealth) and might affect households’ labour supply, lower income taxes (or transfers to those households that do not pay any income tax) should accompany the increase in VAT.

Designing such a measure with a sudden but temporary VAT cut with a pre-specified date in which the VAT will revert back to its original level is exactly what the German administration announced as part of their €130 billion stimulus package. A pre-announced tax increase and a sudden temporary drop in VAT differ in terms of budget neutrality: the former policy is budget neutral for the government if paired with income tax cut or even generates revenues, whereas the latter policy creates budget deficits. In both cases, unconventional fiscal policy incentivises households to consume immediately, jump-tart the economy, and hence help the economy "|0
2020-06-08|"Face coverings may have the order of the day at Foxboro High School’s 145th commencement exercises on Sunday — at least for everyone but graduates and their immediate families.

But even the personal protective equipment worn by faculty, administrators and support staff couldn’t mask the pride displayed for members of the Class of 2020 who reveled in the school’s first-ever drive-thru graduation.

The hybrid ceremony was planned by school and public safety officials to minimize health risks and comply with state guidelines stemming from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Assembling at the Ahern Middle School according to a staggered schedule designed to promote social distancing, students and family members were escorted to the high school in groups of 40 vehicles, according to Police Chief Michael Grace.

“This is very festive,” Grace said. “Everyone has been great about adhering to the restrictions.”

Once arriving at the high school, vehicles queued up in the driveway loop and awaited their turn to pull up at a makeshift stage erected in front of the main office. One by one, class members were personally greeted by Principal Diana Myers-Pachla before mounting the stage to retrieve their diploma — then pausing as the family paparazzi snapped away.

Although some had lamented missing the pomp and circumstance typically associated with a conventional graduation, feeling they were shortchanged by history, local families clearly embraced the novelty of Sunday’s drive-thru format — celebrating the milestone by outfitting cars with balloons, ribbons and other creative decorations.

The unusual format also afforded graduates an opportunity to make impromptu statements before the TV cameras — with many taking advantage of their face time.

“I would just like to thank my parents, my best friends and my teachers for helping me through these four years of high school,” said graduate Alexya Eliopoulos while family members stood outside their car snapping photos.

“A shout out to my family and all of my friends and all of my teachers for helping make this happen,” Fawaz said. “Love you guys.”

Commencement speeches and other remarks typically delivered at graduation were recorded in advance and will be broadcast on Foxboro Cable Access.

In those remarks, class President Sam Belanger suggested that commencement marks a beginning not an end, and voiced confidence that this year’s graduates will make an impact in myriad ways.

“I regret that I am unable to deliver this message in person,” he added. “The circumstances that we are facing are unfortunate. But it is important to keep perspective.”

In conclusion, Belanger counseled classmates to keep a positive attitude and live every day to its fullest.

“We are living in the richest country in the history of the world with opportunity at our fingertips for all of us,” he said. “We’re strong and resilient as a class and we will bounce back from this to accomplish great things. Stay positive and stay strong.”

In her remarks, class Valedictorian Amy Traianou characterized 2020 as “the year that just keeps getting weirder.”

“We may have lost the last couple months of our senior year, but the last three months don’t take away from the four years it took to get here,” she said. “We worked hard and we should be proud of ourselves.”"|2
2020-06-08|"The easing of restrictions brought in to contain the spread of Covid-19 has been accelerated with what has been termed ""Phase 2+"" beginning today, here's what you need to know about the changes.

Everything outlined in Phase 2 has been given the green light while some of Phase 3 has been brought forward.

Stay Local: You may travel within your own county, and up to 20 kilometres from your home if crossing county boundaries.

Meeting other people: You may meet up to six people from outside your household both indoors and outdoors for social gatherings.

Sports: Organised outdoor exercise, sporting, cultural or social activities of up to 15 people may take place. Behind-closed-door horse and greyhound racing can commence. Elite athletes may return to their training facilities.

The Irish Greyhound Board said it has arranged for a ""comprehensive schedule"" of greyhound trials to commence on 8 June at all 14 greyhound tracks with the intention of returning to racing behind closed doors early in the week commencing 15 June.

Shops: Most retailers are reopening - but not all. Penneys will not begin reopening stores until 12 June. Shopping centres can only reopen from 15 June. Opening times will be staggered. Shopping centres must take measures to ensure people do not congregate at benches, fountains or food courts.

Transport: Walk or cycle if you can. Only use public transport if you absolutely need to.

Masks: It is recommenced that face coverings be worn in public places, such as shops, and on public transport.

Funerals: Up to 25 immediate family and close friends may attend funeral services.

Children: Outdoor summer camps may operate for post-primary children in groups of no more than 15. Playgrounds and commercially-serviced outdoor amenities may also reopen. However, Dublin City Council said it does not operate supervised playgrounds and pending further clarification, its playgrounds will not reopen from Monday.

There will be a new Summer Education Programme for children with special educational needs and disadvantaged children. Minister for Education joe McHugh will bring proposals to Government on this next week.

Work: The advice remains to work from home where possible. The Return to Work Safely Protocol is the operative guide for employers and employees. Marts may open where social distancing and hygiene can be maintained.

Read all about it: Public libraries will commence reopening.

International travel: All non-essential overseas travel to and from Ireland should be avoided. Passengers arriving from overseas are expected to self-isolate for 14 days.

Advice for cocooners: If you are over 70 or medically vulnerable, continue to stay home as much as possible. You may welcome small numbers of people to your home, but maintain social distancing. When out shopping, you are advised to use the times specially allotted by retailers. If you are visiting someone who is over 70 or medically vulnerable, be extra-vigilant.

Two metre social distancing: This remains the public health advice.

Nursing homes: Limited nursing home visits will be allowed from 15 June under certain circumstances.

Drinking and eating: Bars (with or without restaurant licences, as long as they serve food) can reopen with table service only and restaurants will reopen alongside hotels. The Taoiseach said detailed guidance will be published next week for hotels, bars, restaurants.

Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan, when asked if people had to eat a meal if they were going to be in a pub, said that ""a few fellas getting together for a few pints and having a packet of peanuts"" does not constitute a meal in a restaurant.

He said people had to be sensible and not congregate at a bar, they had to sit down and be served. Dr Holohan said most Irish people know the difference between a restaurant and a pub and he felt they would be sensible.

Health: Minister Simon Harris says there will be a ""clear timeline"" on resumption of screening programmes expected by the end of June.

Tourism: Hotels, hostels, caravan parks, galleries and museums will welcome visitors again.

Travel: All restrictions for travelling within Ireland will be lifted. There is no date set yet for people to be allowed travel abroad again. Mr Varadkar said he would not encourage anyone to book flights.

Hair salons/barbers: At present, they remain in the Phase 4 stage (20 July).

Weddings: There is no decision yet as to if they can be held in Phase 3 or 4 and the numbers that will be allowed to attend.

Religious services: People can attend services at places of worship from the beginning of Phase 3, with physical distancing measures in place. Catholic Archbishop Diarmuid Martin said ""this will be a consolation to many people and preparations will be intensified to ensure this can be done safely"".

Dr Martin also said that communions and confirmations in small groups may now be able to take place later in the summer.

Childcare: Crèches, childminders and preschools will open for children of all workers who need childcare to return to work. However, where capacity is limited, preference will be give to children of frontline workers. Children will be grouped into pods, of between six and 12, to reduce the risk of transmitting coronavirus.

Phase 4 (20 July) - this is now the final phase

Hair salons/barbers: At present, they will not reopen until this phase.

All bars back: Pubs that do not serve food can reopen. However, Brian Foley from the Vintners' Federation of Ireland has warned that many will remain shut if the two metre social distancing advice remains. ""This is because it would reduce capacity by up to 87% of standing customers and 65% of those seated in a typical bar layout. So it would simply not be viable for many pubs to run a business.""

Socialising: A slightly larger number of people - the exact number yet to be decided - may visit another household for a short period of time while maintaining social distancing. Small social (non-family) gatherings will be allowed but will be limited to a maximum number of participants.

Culture/recreation: Theatres and cinemas can reopen with social distancing in place. Indoor recreational venues, such as bowling alleys and bingo halls, will also open their doors.

Work: There will be a phased return to work across all sectors. Employees who cannot work remotely will be the first to return to onsite working. Depending on the business, measures such as shift work and staggered hours will be implemented. Remote working will continue for those who can do so.

Sport: Close physical contact sports, such as rugby and boxing, can resume. Gyms, dance studios and sports clubs can reopen alongside effective cleaning and social distancing.

Spectators can begin to attend live sporting events only in accordance with both indoor and outdoor number restrictions and where social distancing can be complied with.

Larger gatherings: Some larger social gatherings can take place (for example, weddings). But these will be restricted due to the risks involved."|0
2020-06-08|"This post really is off-topic.

It seemed that 2020 started to get a good year. Life was kind of normal and I was looking forward to the upcoming events. Community events as well as family events. I was really looking forward to the MVP Summit 2020, to meeting good friends again and to visit my favorite city in the US.

But life wouldn't be life if there were no changes and challenges.

February 1st was the end of my old life but the start of a new one. A challenging one and a life full of new chances and opportunities.

My wife and I, we broke up. Without any drama and stuff like this. It was a kind of spontaneous decision but a needed one. It was unexpected for our family and friends but we kind of knew about this for the last three years. It was a shock for the kids for sure but, as I said, there was never any drama and we are still friends and are talking and laughing together. The shock for the kids was a small one and a short one. Actually nothing really changed for the kids, except living in two houses which for sure is a huge change but they seem to love it, to enjoy it like a kind of adventure. Every house has other things they like, other rules and it seems they love to live in both houses.

This might also be shocking for friends who are reading this right now.

To leave the wife that was on my side for around 16 years felt strange and odd. But at the end it was a good decision for both of us.

This for sure results in new challenging situations, like moving into a new apartment and stuff like this.

What else did change?

The second challenging situation is the one that happens to all of us all over the world. The COVID-19 lockdowns all over the world are challenging for everyone. Especially the kids and their parents. Fortunately, I am able to work from home and, fortunately, child care is divided 50/50 between me and my wife. (She is still called my wife because we are still married.) But to work and to do home-schooling and child care in parallel is different, challenging and might be really hard and almost impossible for some parents.

Since COVID-19 happened to central Europe, I was working from home. Actually, today is the first day since weeks I commute to work. Feels strange sitting in the train, for more than one hour, and wearing a face mask. The train is almost empty. Only a few people are talking because of those annoying masks.

And, the first time since months, I have some time to write a blog post. I used to write while commuting, so I took the chance to write some stuff.

What comes next?

The new situation and the less commute time are the reasons why I didn't write a blog post ore something else since January.

The move to the new apartment is done. The kids know the new situation since more than a month and get used to it. It is all settling and calming down and the numbers around COVID-19 are getting better and better in central Europe. Let's have a small look into the future:

I'm going to start challenging myself again to do some more stuff for the developer community:
• Writing a blog post at least every second week
• Just ask for topics.
• Rewriting my book to update it to ASP.NET Core 5.0 and really, really, really get it published
• Writing some more technical articles for my favorite magazine.
• Trying to do some talks on conferences and user groups
• The next planned talk is at the DWX in November this year
• Getting my streaming set up and running in the new apartment and start streaming again
• The bandwidth could be a problem in the new apartment.
• But just recording and feed a YouTube channel could be an option, too.

Actually, this is kind of challenging but why not? I really love challenges :-)"|2
2020-06-09|"From trade-offs to synergies: COVID-19, populism, and sustainable development

Concerns are growing that the COVID-19 crisis could be exploited by populists claiming to be the voice of those who have been ‘left behind’. This column presents a new framework which could help shed light on the relationship between sustainable development and populism. Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals may be associated with diminishing electoral support for populism, but humanity must still get better at turning the trade-offs between SDGs into synergies. During the COVID-19 recovery, an effective way to prevent populists from exploiting the crisis may involve making the SDGs the policy blueprint.

This column is a lead commentary in the VoxEU debate on ""Populism""

In the academic literature, as well as within the VoxEU debate, a number of reasons for the recent rise of populism have been brought forward (for an overview of the literature, see Norris and Inglehart 2018). However, no study has yet looked systematically at the relationship between the rise of populism on the one hand, and the historic Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development on the other. To address this gap, we recently introduced the first systematic classification of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) performance and populism (Kroll and Zipperer 2020). We performed the first empirical analysis of the relationship between populism and the SDGs by examining how countries have progressed on the SDGs over time, and how their development in terms of sustainability relates to subsequent electoral support for populism. We used data from the SDG Index and Dashboards (Sachs et al. 2019 and www.sdgindex.org) which provides “the most comprehensive picture of national progress on the SDGs and offers a useful synthesis of what has been achieved so far” (Nature Sustainability 2018).

The SDGs provide a new and enlarged understanding of sustainability as an economic, social, and environmental challenge. The goals are firmly rooted in the concept of sustainable development, i.e. “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (Brundtland Commission 1987, Sachs 2015). They comprise 17 goals and 169 targets that span a range of topics, from ending extreme poverty (SDG 1) to affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), or a global partnership for the goals (SDG 17) (UN 2015) (see Figure 1).

What makes pursuing the SDGs a particularly challenging task is the fact that these goals have, at present, antagonist tendencies among themselves. In other words, there are numerous trade-offs between SDGs, such as between reducing poverty and climate action, which, in the future, will need to be turned into mutually reinforcing synergies in order to achieve a “virtuous cycle of SDG progress” (Kroll et al. 2019). Colleagues and I have performed a first analysis of future interactions for projected SDG trends until 2030 within and between goals. We analysed how trade-offs and synergies have evolved globally in the recent past. We found an alarming inability to overcome certain persistent trade-offs, as well as the deterioration for some SDGs. These findings seriously threaten the achievement of the Agenda 2030 (ibid).

In order to enable a structured and fine-grained interpretation of the nexus between sustainability and populism in future research and policy debate, we have recently proposed a Sustainability–Populism Framework (Kroll and Zipperer 2020, see Figures 2 and 3). It elaborates on the four possible outcomes for the relationship between SDG performance over time, and subsequent electoral support for populism.
• Quadrant I: “disillusioned performers” (SDG improvement, rising populism). The countries named “disillusioned performers” have been making progress towards the SDGs. However, populist parties were able to gather increased support (e.g. by capitalising on potential fear of regress or scapegoating towards minorities).
• Quadrant II: “failing prey (to populists)” (SDG deterioration, rising populism). Countries in this category have been failing to advance on the SDGs, and they are falling prey to populists and the political recipes they propose.
• Quadrant III: “resilient believers (in liberal democracy)” (SDG deterioration, falling populism). Even though the situation with regard to the SDGs has deteriorated over the last years, countries in this group keep their faith in traditional mainstream parties and the solutions they propose to overcome the challenges.
• Quadrant IV: “consolidating achievers” (SDG improvement, falling populism). These countries have been making progress towards the SDGs, and the calls by populists to steer in a different direction are not heeded by voters.

The SDGs as an answer to populism

For illustrative purposes of the framework’s analytical value, we examined data on SDG progress and populist vote shares that were available for 39 countries (SDG progress data for 2010 – 2015). Although, due to a time lag, the raw data sometimes precede that period; populist vote share data represent the change from second-last to last election, with the last election mainly taking place between 2015 and 2018 (for details, see Kroll and Zipperer 2020). Most countries fall into Quadrant I and IV. In other words, while most of the countries examined have experienced progress towards the SDGs, they differ in terms of whether the electorate has subsequently turned to populists or not. A number of countries have also experienced SDG regress, and subsequently seen an increase in electoral support for populists (Quadrant I). Almost no countries can be found in Quadrant III, with Greece being an exception where possibly a disillusionment with populists has meant that voters turned away from them. An additional analysis for each SDG separately can be found in the paper.

As political systems in many nations continue to be faced with growing populist parties, our analysis sheds some light onto examples where mainstream political parties prevailed as unchallenged political hegemons in light of their good performance on economic, social, and environmental SDGs. A particularly promising avenue for future research may be dissecting the political discourses in the countries where populists have triumphed despite progress towards the SDGs being made (Quadrant I: “disillusioned performers”), and what differentiates such a political discourse from that taking place in countries of the other categories, especially the “consolidating achievers” group. In other words: Why does success on the SDGs result in diminishing support for populists in certain countries but not in some others?

In order to further explore the nature of the statistical relationship between the two concepts beyond the aforementioned framework, we also performed a linear regression analysis. We thereby examined the SDG performance over time as a potential determinant of the populist vote share in the subsequent election. We find a significant negative effect of overall SDG country performance over time on the change in populist vote share (controlling for GDP per capita change PPP). For each one-point increase on the aggregate SDG Index (out of 100), the vote share of populist parties on average drops by about two percentage points. We also find significant negative effects of progress in SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), and SDG 15 (Life on land). The effect sizes vary as follows. For each one-point increase on the SDG 1 indicator (out of 100), the vote share of populist parties on average drops by about 0.3 percentage points, while for SDG 2 it drops by about 2.4 percentage points. For SDG 11, the drop is by about one percentage point, and for SDG 15 by about half a percentage point.

Making the SDGs the blueprint for the COVID-19 recovery

As countries are now beginning to organise the recovery after COVID-19, many commentators have expressed concerns that the hardship associated with the crisis might be exploited by populists in numerous countries, potentially leading to a new wave of electoral support for populism. The lessons from recent findings discussed here lend support to the notion that a strong commitment to the SDGs (overall, as well as in particular to the SDGs 2, 11, and 15) could be part of an appropriate and effective answer to populism. The SDGs would therefore be a very suitable blueprint for the COVID-19 recovery.

Grieving and frustrated: Black scientists call out racism in the wake of police killings

As marchers in the United States and around the world filled the streets this past week to protest against police brutality and racial injustice, Black scientists grieved openly on social media, calling for action on racism in society and in science. Many stated ways in which institutions and colleagues, from collaborators to meeting organizers, could support Black scientists. Some pushed universities and scientific societies to release statements against racism. And several posted that the weight of the current events has made it even harder to do their jobs in a profession that already marginalizes them.

Hundreds are planning to stop their research tomorrow (except for time-sensitive activities related to COVID-19) as part of an academic strike in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. The goal is to take “time to learn, reflect, critique, and chart a course of action”, writes Particles for Justice, a group of physicists co-organizing the strike.

“Horrible.” “Totally unreliable.” “A buggy mess.” Over the past month, software engineers have sharply criticized the code underpinning an influential coronavirus simulation by scientists at Imperial College London, one of several models that helped sway UK politicians into declaring a lockdown. Now, a computational neuroscientist has reported that he has independently rerun the simulation and reproduced its results. And other scientists have told Nature that they had already privately verified that the code is reproducible.

IBM will no longer sell “general purpose” facial-recognition technology, chief executive Arvind Krishna wrote in a letter to US Congress. The letter addressed the need for reforms and policy proposals to address racial disparities, and mentioned that the company opposes using technology for mass surveillance, racial profiling and violations of human rights. Krishna wrote that “vendors and users of Al systems have a shared responsibility to ensure that Al is tested for bias, particularly when used in law enforcement”.

Archaeologists have mapped a full ancient city with ground-penetrating radar. Falerii Novi, a 30-hectare settlement near Rome that was occupied between 241 BC and AD 700, is now almost entirely buried under agricultural land. The team towed their radar antennas with a quad bike. Their finds include a mysterious public monument — possibly linked to pre-Roman religions — and an extensive network of water pipes that was evidently planned and laid before the city was built. The non-invasive technique has a lot of potential, says archaeologist Martin Millett. “As I wander around the Roman empire, I look at all kinds of places and think, ‘Wow, what we could do there.’”

Lockdowns and other distancing measures have had resounding success at thwarting the new coronavirus, according to two independently conducted studies. One found that stay-at-home orders and policies that restrict face-to-face contact were especially effective in 11 European countries, reducing transmission by 81%. The combination of policies aimed at slowing the virus’s spread prevented more than 3 million deaths from the epidemic’s start to early May. Another study that looked at China, the United States and 4 more countries showed that across all 6 countries, anti-transmission measures averted roughly 500 million infections. Contaminated surfaces might have only a minor role in transmitting COVID-19 within households. Researchers looked for traces of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in 21 households that each included at least one infected person. They found viral RNA in just 3% of samples from the most frequently touched objects, such as door knobs, and in 15% of samples from bathroom drains and toilets. The team could not grow infectious virus from any of the samples. Researchers have identified two human gene variants that could make people more susceptible to lung failure associated with COVID-19. One variant lies in the swathe of the genome that determines blood groups. People with blood type A+ had an increased risk of lung failure compared with those with other blood types, whereas those with type O blood were protected to some extent. The second variant, on chromosome 3, is near six genes, including one that interacts with the molecular receptor that the virus uses to enter human cells.

2020-06-09|"Since the first case of Covid-19 was found in New Zealand on 28th February we have all had to change our way of life. These Wellington images and video portray some of that journey.

Real estate agents are adopting new strategies to survive the lockdown and do business in the transformed economic landscape, writes Rakesh Krishnan.

Not surprisingly, the lack of ability to conduct business face to face during the lockdown has caused major disruption in the way people function in this sector.

With people generally insecure about their jobs or maybe even having lost their jobs, many potential home buyers are – at least for the short term – reluctant to plonk down their cash on a big-ticket purchase. Consequently, many real estate agents have adopted innovative strategies to cope during these unprecedented times.

Some of the agents Prosper talked to said the first few days of the lockdown felt really strange and it took a bit of getting used to, but after a week or so a new normal emerged. There was a realisation that you had to make the best of a dicey situation.

Green Bay-based Vicky Ingham of Ray White had a new listing ready to go live in the week of the lockdown but after discussion with the vendor she held it over until level 3. ""I made myself available to buyers and sellers who needed advice over the lockdown period but took care not to contact people who may have been under stress during that time,"" she said.

The new normal in real estate is that if you can't hit the bricks, go online. Ingham points out that some of her colleagues were able to secure contracts over the lockdown which included a clause 'subject to the purchaser viewing in level 3'. ""This worked well for buyers who loved the look of a home online, with the option of being able to view at a later date before declaring a contract unconditional,"" she said.

Ingham, who has been in the industry for close to a decade, points out that many aspects of real estate work can be effectively managed online. FlexiSign is a product which allows for signing of contracts online; virtual tours are now offered by most real estate photographers; and online auctions are being further developed.

So what's in store for Auckland's real estate industry?

""Contactless online marketing will become more dominant than ever and being up to speed with product development will be vital,"" Ingham said.

""Going forward, technology will just get better and while it allows us to do a high quality job, everything in the short term will run at a slower pace to enable us to keep buyers and vendors and their properties safe.""

Robbie Bhullar and Vish Bhati of Barfoot & Thompson agree technology is rapidly transforming the real estate industry. Until recently, the two West Auckland agents were selling a property every 4.74 days, so the Covid-19 pandemic has been especially hard on them.

However, being early adopters of technology helped them mitigate some of the after-effects of the slowdown. ""Even as trading remained restricted during the lockdown, we were able to do digital negotiation and contactless transactions with existing customers,"" they said. ""Electronic platforms such as DocuSign, Trello and CRM systems made things easy during the lockdown.""

South Auckland-based Heather Obern and Kevin Arthur of Ray White Manukau observe online marketing and communication has already become the primary medium of selling in the industry. ""During the lockdown it was our window on the world,"" they said. ""Properties can and are being sold without physical viewing, especially for investment, but most home buyers still want to view the home and see what it 'feels' like. Enhanced digital viewings will help people decide whether they really want a physical viewing.""

According to Heather and Kevin, off-market listings are becoming a significant segment of the market and may be more appealing in the post-Covid marketplace. These are listed properties that are not widely advertised but available through an agent. ""This gives tighter control around viewing, more vendor privacy and better qualified buyers. We also think more salespeople will work away from their offices, using virtual communications and online meetings at times. Offices may shrink in size as a result.""

Clearly, the real estate landscape has changed, and not everyone will come unscathed through the current crisis. The industry is based on commission-only income, so agents without a reservoir of experience or in offices that aren't professional or using new strategies will struggle – they will be outclassed by savvy competitors.

Agents believe the removal of the loan-to-value restrictions (LVR), attractive low interest rates and a lower median price should bring in more first-time buyers, giving the market a boost. While this may not be the best time to be a real estate agent, those with skin in the game are putting up a brave front. Perhaps there's no other alternative."|2
2020-06-09|"The Australian Dollar extended its recent upturn, consolidating a break above 0.70 US cents on Monday. Equity markets and a sustained risk on move dragged the currency higher, while broad based US dollar weakness helped mark fresh highs at 0.7029. With much of the country enjoying an extended long weekend in observance of the Queen’s birthday the AUD took its cues from offshore risk flows, while reports New Zealand is now COVID-19 free and moving to level 1 restrictions helped bolster demand and drag the AUD higher still. The AUD advanced against the USD, GBP and EURO while giving up ground against the NZD, JPY and CHF. The correction against the JPY and CHF suggest the weeks early moves weren’t driven by typical risk on dynamics rather mounting USD uncertainty. With recent gains pushing the top-end of short term models we expect some resistance on moves beyond 0.70. That said the AUD advance can be supported by improving fundamentals and as the Australian economy looks set to rebound at a faster pace than first anticipated there is scope to suggest further upside in the medium term.

Attentions this week remain with risk drivers while the Fed and FOMC policy meeting Wednesday dominates the macroeconomic docket.

The US dollar remains under pressure, slipping against all major counterparts through trade on Monday. The Japanese Yen and Swiss France both enjoyed strong gains, recovering much of lasts weeks losses and topping gains across majors for the day. The upturn for the JPY and CHF suggests Monday’s move was not a typical risk on shift but rather broad-based USD weakness. With the US struggling to contain the coronavirus and Congress slow to deliver Fiscal support investors are moving away from the USD as the safe haven dynamic shifts.

The Euro continues to enjoy sustained upside support, holding near 1.13 on open this morning, while the GBP advanced four tenths of a percent pushing toward 1.2750. Despite its own underlying instability, the GBP has enjoyed strong gains through the last month, bouncing off lows at 1.2080. Given the broad-based USD weakness a better measure or Sterling is its performance against key crosses. The GBP has plunged against both the NZD and AUD while Euro/pound despite moderating through the start of June is up almost 2 cents since the start of May. The Coronavirus continues to plague the UK, and while they reported the lowest number of fatalities since the March lockdown began, 55 people still lost their lives to COVID-19 a number much to high if restrictions are to see any meaningful easing. As the UK struggles to throw off the coronavirus and Brexit looking ever larger there is little to drive GBP upside through the medium term.

Attentions today remain with risk and broad-based US direction ahead of tomorrow FOMC meeting and Fed policy announcement.

2020-06-09|"Ireland is facing a “tsunami” of mental health problems due to the coronavirus pandemic, with early indications showing an increase in suicide and self-harm, health experts warn.

Data collection on suicides by Irish hospitals were suspended as a result of the lockdown, meaning there are no current figures on suicide and self-harm rates, according to the National Self-Harm Registry.

However other data sources point to a significant upward trend. In March and April of this year, 17 per cent of patients admitted to the National Spinal Injuries Unit in the Mater Hospital had sustained injuries in a suicide attempt compared to one per cent in the same period last year.

The numbers involved are small but they reflect a trend which is being seen elsewhere. According to a recent US study, 45 per cent of people with suicidal thoughts explicitly linked them to Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.

On Monday, the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland (CPI) concluded a survey of 615 consultants. The data is still being analysed but there are early indications of a worrying trend, the college said.

“A large proportion of consultants are reporting that they are now seeing an increase in people experiencing both new-onset and relapse of mental illness compared to the early stages of the lockdown but also to before the lockdown came into place,” said Andrea Ryder of the CPI.

Increasing numbers of patients are presenting with suicidal ideation and signs of self-harm, she said.

“We can see and we know that a tsunami of mental health issues are coming. We know that anecdotally from us working as clinicians in emergency hospitals and in community settings,” said Professor Fiona McNicholas, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist.

There is particular concern about the mental health of young people already prone to anxiety and the elderly who have been forced to cocoon since the start of the pandemic.

In one young person, the lockdown exacerbated an eating disorder, said Prof McNicholas.

“The loss of their ability to engage in their usual exercises led them to over focus on eating. They presented in a very malnourished state with typical anorexic behaviour.”

In a second case, a previously healthy young boy started exercising on his own to maintain his fitness during lockdown.

“Unfortunately for him, it led to exercise addiction,” said Prof McNicholas. “To the point where he lost 20 per cent of his body weight and was medically compromised.”

Dr John Lyne, a consultant general adult psychiatrist and editor of the IJPM, said there is potential for an increase in suicides, particularly if there is a severe economic depression. In the past social upheavals such as the Troubles or the 2008 recession, were associated with raised suicide rates, which can last for years.

The pandemic has also coincided with an increase in other mental health crises. In March and April the number of applications by gardaí to the Mental Health Commission (MHC) for the involuntary admission of mentally ill people increased by 7 per cent compared to the same period last year.

“However, the reason for this slight increase is not possible without a more detailed analysis,” the MHC said.

2020-06-09|"Several large-scale genomic studies are gearing up to pin down the genes underlying individual responses to COVID-19. Genomics England is partnering with Illumina and the UK National Health Service (NHS) to sequence the genomes of 35,000 patients: 15,000 with mild symptoms and 20,000 who required intensive care. A separate group, UK BioBank, is assembling research materials from data on patients with COVID-19 collected by Public Health England, which they will share with 15,000 approved researchers from 85 countries. Finally, nearly 1,000 human geneticists formed the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, organized by the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland.

Private companies are also contributing. Consumer genomics companies 23andme and Ancestry.com are setting up programs to link COVID-19 symptoms and experiences with genomic information contained in their databases. In the first few weeks 23andme identified 6,000 people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and in May stepped up its efforts to assemble thousands more by offering free genome analysis to non-members who qualify and are willing to join a COVID-19 research program. Ancestry.com has asked its customer base to fill out a survey on their COVID-19 experiences, the results of which they will share with qualified researchers at no cost.

In the largest study of any kind on COVID-19, a team led by Ben Goldacre at the University of Oxford reported in the preprint server medRxiv that Asians and members of minority groups in the UK face an increased risk of death by COVID-19. Analyzing health records of over 17 million patients from the NHS, the researchers found that comorbidities (such as heart disease, diabetes, asthma and obesity), largely assumed to be behind the increased risk, accounted for only about half the disparity in deaths between minority and white populations. A smaller study by the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners looking at risk factors for testing positive for COVID-19 was published in mid-May."|2
2020-06-09|"The killing of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police department, and President Donald Trump’s crushing of protests across the United States, has angered the world, and led to marches in cities globally. The repeated killings of Black people in the United States serve as reminders — reminders that should not be needed — of the injustice, violence and systemic inequality that Black Americans continue to experience in every sphere of life.

Black people are more likely than white people to die at the hands of the police; more likely to become unemployed; and, as COVID-19 has laid bare, more likely to be burdened with ill health. Black people are similarly marginalized in most nations where they are in the minority.

Nature condemns police prejudice and violence, we stand against all forms of racism and we join others around the world in saying, unequivocally, that Black Lives Matter.

Such statements are necessary, but they are not sufficient. They need to be followed by meaningful action.

Black people, including researchers, are taking to social media to spell out what that action should look like, calling attention to decades of literature on the steps necessary to make academia and science equitable. This outpouring is, in part, because Black researchers have long been denied a space and a platform in established institutions and publications such as this one.

We recognize that Nature is one of the white institutions that is responsible for bias in research and scholarship. The enterprise of science has been — and remains — complicit in systemic racism, and it must strive harder to correct those injustices and amplify marginalized voices.

At Nature, we will redouble our efforts to do so, and commit to establishing a process that will hold us to account on the many changes we need to make.

In addition, we commit to producing a special issue of the journal, under the guidance of a guest editor, exploring systemic racism in research, research policy and publishing — including investigating Nature’s part in that.

Together with the rest of the research community, we must listen, reflect, learn and act — and we must never shirk our responsibility to end systemic racism."|1
2020-06-09|"In times of crisis, humans have a tendency to turn to religion for comfort and explanation. The COVID-19 pandemic is no exception. Using daily data on Google searches for 95 countries, this column demonstrates that the COVID-19 crisis has increased Google searches for prayer (relative to all Google searches) to the highest level ever recorded. By the end of March 2020, more than half of the world population had prayed to ‘end the coronavirus’. Prayer searches rose at all levels of income, inequality, and insecurity, but not for the 10% least religious countries.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought sizeable costs for societies across the globe. A pandemic of this size potentially changes our societies for years to come, especially if it impacts our ingrained values and beliefs. It may have impacted values such as populism, nationalism (Morelli 2020, Baldwin and Weder di Mauro 2020), and economic anxiety (Fetzer et al. 2020). In a new paper (Bentzen 2020), I document the manner in which the COVID-19 crisis has influenced one of the most deeply rooted human behaviours: Religion. People pray in order to cope with uncertainty and adversity.

This rising religiosity may have implications for the economy in various ways. First, a large part of the economic downturn in the face of COVID-19 is due to economic anxiety (Andersen et al. 2020, Fetzer et al. 2020). If religion dampens anxiety, religious societies may experience smaller reductions in consumption. It is evident that religion worked as such a buffer during previous large macroeconomic downturns caused by the Spanish flu and WWI (Bentzen and Dalgaard 2020).

Second, COVID-19 may increase religiosity permanently, which in turn could impact the wider economy. Likewise, it should be noted that earthquakes increase religiosity permanently across generations (Bentzen 2019). Previous research has documented a multitude of correlations between religiosity and socio-economic factors: from peoples’ ability to cope with stress and uncertainty, to reductions in criminal behavior (Guiso et al. 2003, Miller et al. 2014), to lower GDP growth and more traditional gender roles (McCleary and Barro 2006, Inglehart and Norris 2003).

Third, rising ‘prayer intensity’ reveals that people from across the globe experience emotional distress in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, and they use religion in order to cope. The economic consequences of these emotional effects may be large (Andersen et al. 2020), with the main part of the economic downturn being due to the perceived risk of the virus, rather than government mandated lockdowns.

In my recent paper, I identify empirically the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic has induced people across the globe to pray, whether the phenomenon is global, and who prays in times of crisis. Google searches for religious terms, as a share of all Google searches, provides a signal of peoples’ interest in religion in real time. Various research suggests that our behaviour on the internet reflects our personal interests and the actions we take in the real world (Moat et al. 2016, Olivola et al. 2019, Ginsberg et al. 2009). Likewise, whether or not we search for religious terms on the internet reflects our religious preferences (Yeung 2019, Stephens-Davidowich 2015).

The main analysis focuses on searches for the topic ‘prayer’, including all topics related to prayer in all languages. Searches for other religious terms also rise, such as God, Allah, Muhammad, Quran, Bible, and Jesus, and, to a lesser extent, searches for Buddha, Vishnu, and Shiva (the latter two being Hindu gods).

Events that instigate intensified prayer are clearly visible in the data. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Ramadan contributed to the largest yearly increase in the global search intensity for prayer (Panel A of Figure 1). Also, prayer search shares spike upwards on Sundays everywhere. Searches for prayer surged in Iran on 07 January 2020, coinciding with the funeral of Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian major general killed by US troops. Similar spikes were seen in Australia on 05 January 2020, when the movement ""Prayer for Australia"" swept across the world in the midst of the unprecedented bushfires, and in Albania on 26 November 2019 when the country was hit by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake.

In March 2020, the share of Google searches for prayer surged to the highest level ever recorded, surpassing all other major events that otherwise call for prayer, such as Christmas, Easter, and Ramadan (Figure 1). The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The level of prayer search shares in March 2020 was more than 50% higher than the average during February 2020. For comparison, the surge in Google searches for prayer was 1.3 times larger than the rise in searches for takeaways, and amounted to 12% of the rise in Netflix searches or 26% of the fall in searches for flights, which all saw massive changes globally (since most countries were in lockdown and air traffic was shut down).

Figure 1 Worldwide Google searches for “prayer” during the past 4 years

Notes: Google searches for prayer relative to the total number of Google searches. The maximum shares were set to 100. The searches encompass all topics related to prayer, including alternative spellings and languages. The vertical stippled lines in panel (a) represent the first week of the Ramadan. The period in panel (a) is the longest period for which comparable data was available at the time of writing. The period in panel (b) is the period used in the main analysis (starting before COVID-19 became a pandemic and ending before the onset of Easter and the Ramadan).

Google search results for ‘prayer’ usually provide prayer texts to use when praying. Prayers may be recited from memory or read from a book. In modern times, these books or verses of prayer can be found on the internet. One of the most searched for prayer categories in March 2020 was ""Coronavirus prayer"", which are prayers that ask God for protection against the coronavirus, prayers to stay strong, and prayers to thank nurses for their efforts. According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, more than half of Americans had prayed to end the coronavirus (Pew 2020b).

Using daily data on Google searches for prayer for 95 countries across the globe, I find that the rise visible in Figure 1 occurs around 11 March 2020 for most countries, and increasingly so after their own populations had been infected. The rise in prayer is a global phenomenon, with all countries (except the 10% least religious) seeing significant rises in prayer search shares. Figure 2 illustrates which countries saw the largest rise in searches for prayer, indicated by darker shades of green. Regionally, the largest increases occur in South America, Africa, and Indonesia, some of the most religious areas of the world. In general, the more religious societies searched more for prayer on the internet. Prayer searches rose for all major religious denominations, but only significantly for Christians and Muslims. The rise was more modest for Hindus and Buddhists.

Figure 2 The rise in prayer search shares across the globe in March 2020

Notes: Darker green indicates larger rises in prayer search shares. Missing data is indicated with grey.

Prayer search shares rose more in poorer, more insecure, and more unequal countries. However, this impact is exclusively due to these countries being more religious. This indicates that the availability of religion may be more important for its’ use in coping, rather than the potential need for religion.

Using these results (and the Pew (2020b) survey documenting that more than half of the Americans had prayed to end the coronavirus), a back of the envelope calculation shows that more than half of the global population had prayed to end the coronavirus by the end of March 2020.

The main reason for the rising interest in prayer on the internet is religious coping, where people use their religion to cope with adversity (Pargament 2001). They pray for relief, understanding, and comfort. Research has documented that people struggling with cancer, death within their close family, or severe illness are more religious. Recent research shows that adversity in the form of natural disasters causes people to use their religion more intensively (Bentzen 2019, Sibley and Bulbulia 2012).

People may use Google to search for prayer for a reason unrelated to religious coping. They may be searching for online forums to replace their physical churches that closed down in an attempt to enforce social distancing. Theoretically, we would not expect this to be the main explanation for the rising search shares for prayer. People tend to use mainly their intrinsic religiosity (such as private prayer) rather than their extrinsic religiosity (such as churchgoing) to cope with adversity (Pargament 2001 and Bentzen 2019). In addition, a recent survey reveals that 95% of Americans who pray, pray alone, while only 2% pray collectively in a church (Barna 2017). Thus, even if the churches had been open, we would expect prayer to rise more than churchgoing. Another survey shows that 24% of Americans respond that their faith has strengthened since the onset of the coronavirus crisis, which we would not have predicted if people were simply replacing their physical churchgoing with online church (Pew 2020a). They must be doing something that strengthens their faith. The empirical results support the claim that replacement of physical churches is not the main reason for the rise in Google searches for prayer. For instance, searches for the topic ""internet church"" also rise but follow a distinctly different pattern than the prayer searches (and the change is of a much smaller magnitude). Also, the search shares for prayer continue to rise long after the church closures. Further, the rise in prayer searches is not limited to Sundays, where most masses are held, but occur on al"|0

2020-06-10|"Part of the rationale for such barriers is the critical importance of Canadian experience and the need for medical professionals to meet Canadian standards. Requirements for residency experience within Canada are coupled with a limited number of spots, which essentially forces many physicians to start over despite having potentially decades of experience under their belt. Even Canadian-trained medical students can struggle to find placements, but for internationally trained physicians it is even more difficult. In 2019, the Canadian Residency Matching Service reported that out of 1,758 international medical graduates, 1,360 were not matched with residency placements. And even if internationally trained physicians receive a spot, they are often underemployed and unsupported, leading to financial and emotional hardship.

As foreign experts languish in the system, the need for physicians continues to be great. Many institutions have noted Canada falls behind the majority of OECD nations when it comes to physicians per capita. According to the World Bank, Canada has only 2.6 doctors for every 1,000 residents. Italy, which until recently was the epicentre of the pandemic, has about 50 per cent more per capita.

The COVID-19 crisis has spurred some promising initiatives to leverage this untapped talent pool to address an immense need. Italy, the United Kingdom and some American states have eased the requirements for internationally educated physicians and novice medical graduates to contribute to national COVID-19 efforts. For example, in New Jersey, authorities have granted temporary licences to doctors residing in state with good standing in foreign countries. In New York, internationally trained medical graduates are now allowed to treat patients after one year of residency, compared to the regular requirement of three years.

Some medical licensing bodies in Canada are taking similar steps. For example, in Ontario, international medical graduates who have passed their exams in Canada can apply for a 30-day medical licence. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia has fast-tracked a new bylaw to amend the province’s Health Professions Act so international medical graduates can apply for a supervised associate physician licence allowing them to work under the supervision of attending physicians.

These efforts to lower barriers to entry show promise as a way to address the immediate health crisis. But the pandemic also presents a crucial opportunity to leverage this globally educated talent pool over the long term. The Canadian population is aging and more health care is being delivered outside of hospitals, so we will continue to need more health professionals in the community. Many Canadians also find it challenging to find a physician who understands their mother tongue and cultural context; internationally trained medical professionals can help plug those health equity gaps.

We need federal leadership during this crisis to ensure there is coordination across all jurisdictions to achieve clarity for internationally trained physicians. Canada should consider several options to achieve this:
• Adopt the solution proposed by the Ontario Council of Agencies Serving Immigrants, Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council and World Education Services to recruit, train and deploy internationally trained physicians to support our health-care systems during this time of emergency.
• Automatically grant physicians who have been provided a temporary licence during the pandemic the ability to practise to their full capacity afterwards.
• Increase the number of residency spaces for internationally trained physicians.
• Once this pandemic passes, a federal-provincial-territorial working group should be established to examine the issue more deeply and build pan-Canadian consensus. One of the first tasks assigned to this entity should be to create a simplified accreditation process across the country.

Over the past number of years, we’ve seen various orders of government, academic institutions and self-governed medical professions work together to make some progress, such as investing in bridging programs and placements for internationally trained physicians. This is a helpful start but more needs to be done. COVID-19 provides an opportunity to accelerate the many good program and policy ideas that have already been discussed or introduced in ways that are too limited. Now is the time to make real and lasting progress to help our health-care system, internationally trained medical professionals and Canadians in need of health care.

2020-06-10|"A quarter of all rural US hospitals, most of which are highly essential to their communities, are at high risk of closing.Hospital closures may increase transport time and delay treatment. This column examines hospital closures in California from 1995 to 2011 to assess the effects of rural and urban hospital closures on inpatient mortality. Mortality increases after a rural hospital closure not only in the local rural area but in the neighbouring urban areas as well. This adverse effect is larger for Medicaid patients and racial minorities.

About 15% of all US hospitals have closed since 1990, and the rate of closures has accelerated in recent years, in part due to declining inpatient use (Carroll 2019, Lindrooth et al. 2003). Rural closures have increased since 2010 and 25% of all rural hospitals – of which 82% are considered highly essential to their communities – are at high risk of closing (Mosley and Debehnke 2020, North Carolina Rural Health Research Program 2020, Holmes et al. 2017). There have been prominent media outcries regarding the rural hospital crisis, including in 2020 presidential campaign discussions (McCausland 2019, Tribble 2019, Estes 2020, Raffa 2019, Frakt 2018).

Internationally, too, smaller, rural, and remote hospitals are under the threat of closures (Vaughan and Edwards 2020). Low patient volumes, low reimbursement rates, and costly uncompensated care are commonly cited reasons for weakened hospital finances that lead to closures (Carroll 2019, Lindrooth et al. 2018, Kaufman et al. 2016).

The COVID-19 pandemic (or any future economic downturn) is expected to worsen the situation. COVID-19 has led to a 12.1% drop in the US GDP component related to hospitals, and as millions of workers lose their employer-covered insurance, hospitals could be facing unprecedented levels of uncompensated care, drastically increasing the risk of and concerns related to hospital closures (Federation of American Hospitals 2020, Mosley and Debehnke 2020, Ellison 2020).

Hospital closures pose a conundrum for economists, policymakers, and hospital administrators. Closures may seem reasonable and inevitable if hospitals are suffering financially, but they can severely fracture patient access and cause enormous harm to patient health (Kaufman et al. 2016).

In a well-functioning market, a firm’s shutdown often signals underlying inefficiency or low product demand. Previous studies have shown this to be the case for the hospital industry, where closures – especially urban ones – were positively associated with inefficiency (Capps et al. 2010, Lindrooth 2003).

A large body of literature suggests that the risk of closure is higher for smaller and non-profit hospitals. Large hospitals can achieve greater efficiency through economies of scale and for-profit hospitals are more responsive to competitive pressures and can ‘cream-skim’ or choose patients that enhance profitability (Allen 2017, Hodgson, et al. 2015, Lindrooth et al. 2003).

The natural divide between rural and urban hospitals

The cost structure, profit motives, and patient mix of hospitals thus engender a natural divide between rural and urban hospitals, one that has continued to widen in recent years (Lindrooth et al. 2018, Thomas et al. 2016, Kaufman et al. 2016).

Rural hospitals may be too small to operate efficiently (Song and Saghafian 2019, Carroll 2019), and economic downturns lead to shrinking populations in rural areas, implying lower patient volumes at hospitals.

Populations left behind may be older, sicker, and more reliant on Medicaid and Medicare, which are financially less favourable payer-mixes for hospitals, making rural hospitals more susceptible to closures and cause for high concern (Kaufman et al. 2016). The same concerns regarding financial viability may also deter new hospitals from entering rural healthcare markets.

Effects of rural hospital closures on patient access and health outcomes

Efficiency considerations of closures must, nonetheless, account for their effect on patient welfare. Urban closures may increase overall patient welfare through by way of cost savings for all patients from the closure of inefficient hospitals (Capps et al. 2010), but patient access and outcomes are also crucial components of patient welfare (Gaynor and Town 2011).

Even if market forces drive hospital shutdowns, closures raise significant concerns about increased transportation time, treatment delay, and adverse health outcomes, especially for emergency care (Miller et al. 2020, Carroll 2019, Sun et al. 2005, Wishner et al. 2016). Patient disutility from access issues can offset utility gains from cost savings, particularly in rural markets (Hsia and Shen 2011, McNamara 1999).

Compared to studies examining reasons for or the financial impact of closures, literature studying the effect of hospital closures, both rural and urban, on patient outcomes is relatively sparse and lacks consensus. Large-scale published studies have found no impact of closures on patient mortality with some evidence of improved outcomes, i.e. a reduction in mortality, for heart attack patients (Joynt et al. 2015). Only one published county-level study (Buchmueller et al. 2006) thus far has shown adverse patient-level impact, i.e. increased deaths due to urban closures.

Given the recent increase in closures, crucial efforts to ascertain the patient-level impact are currently underway; recent working papers (Song and Saghafian 2019, Carroll 2019) do find that closures can increase mortality. However, the emerging and existing work has focused almost exclusively on Medicare patients; there is a need to also study potentially more vulnerable non-Medicare populations.

Patient outcome studies either examine rural closures while ignoring concurrent urban closures (making it difficult to disentangle the isolated effect of rural closures) or study the general effect of closures without distinguishing rural from urban. However, there are baseline and post-closure differences between rural and urban hospitals and markets that suggest potentially different effects of rural and urban closures.

At baseline, rural patients face larger transportation times and access barriers, bypass nearby hospitals, and are more likely to use hospitals for primary care needs, compared to urban patients (Wishner et al. 2016, Escarce and Kapur 2009). Rural patients experience a 76% increase in ambulance transportation time post-closure in their ZIP code, whereas urban patients do not experience any such change post-closure in their ZIP code (Troske and Davis 2019).

While urban patients may shift their usual source of care from hospitals to physicians’ offices (Buchmueller et al. 2006), no such favourable substitution is observed for rural patients (Rosenbach and Dayhoff 1995), most likely because there are fewer remaining alternatives in rural areas.

Additionally, rural closures can lead to immediate, substantial, and persistent outmigration of healthcare professionals (Germack et al. 2019, Manlove and Whitacre 2017), dismembering patient access and jeopardising patient outcomes. As rural hospitals are an integral part of the community’s economic foundation, closures also have dire consequences on the local economy (Manlove and Whitacre 2017, Holmes et al. 2006, Probst et al. 1999).

Given such baseline and post-closure differences, the overall adverse effect of a rural hospital closure, which includes transportation delays and related spillover effects, is likely larger than that of an urban closure.

Our recent working paper (Gujral and Basu 2019) uses a difference-in-difference approach to study the impact of rural and urban hospital closures in California in 1995–2011, on adjusted inpatient mortality for time-sensitive conditions. Outcomes of admissions in hospital service areas with and without closure(s) (‘treatment’ versus ‘control’, respectively) are compared before and after the closure year (Figure 1).

Notes: Map of California showing rural and urban ZIP codes, closure ZIP codes, and hospital service area boundaries that indicate affected patients.

We focus on: (1) the differential effects of rural and urban hospital closures, and (2) the effect on Medicare as well as non-Medicare populations.

Figure 2 shows trends in unadjusted inpatient mortality before and after closures. The control group and the general (non-differentiated) treatment group follow a similar trajectory prior to closure, and there does not appear to be any change post-closure for the treatment group.

Figure 2 Unadjusted inpatient mortality for admissions in hospital service areas with and without hospital closures

This graphical observation is supported by the difference-in-difference estimation, wherein we find no measurable impact of closures on inpatient mortality, similar to Joynt et al. (2015) and Hsia et al. (2012).

We then differentiate the treatment group by rurality, as shown in Figure 3. The left-hand side shows that in urban areas, there is no change in unadjusted inpatient mortality after the hospital closure, similar to Figure 2 above. However, the right-hand side shows a post-hospital-closure increase in mortality for rural areas.

Figure 3 Unadjusted inpatient mortality for urban and rural areas with and without hospital closures

Notes: Unadjusted inpatient mortality for: control vs urban treatment group (top), and control vs rural treatment group (bottom).

The difference-in-difference estimation shows that rural closures increase inpatient mortality by 8.7%, while urban closures have no measurable impact. This suggests that when no distinction is made between rural or urban closures, the null effect of urban closures have the potential to dominate and mask the significant and detrimental impact of rural closures.

Our subgroup analyses indicate that Medicaid patients and racial minorities are relatively worse affected by rural closures (11.3% and 12.6%, respectively), which supports the "|1

Reducing social contacts can slow the spread of COVID-19. This column examines mobility patterns across US counties between mid-February and mid-May 2020. It finds that reductions in mobility differed across counties, and that community-level social capital can explain the geographic variations in mobility trends. Individuals reduced mobility earlier and to a higher degree in counties with high levels of social capital. Many counties, particularly in the Southeast US, may be especially vulnerable to COVID-19, matching low levels of social capital with high rates of chronic disease.

Until a vaccine or effective pharmacological treatments for COVID-19 become widely available, individuals can protect themselves and others around them through a combination of social distancing and behavioural changes that reduce transmission when contacts occur. The scientific community has highlighted the importance of limiting social contacts and governments worldwide have either advised or mandated sheltering-in-place orders to promote behavioural changes (Hartl et al. 2020). However, social distancing has major economic and social consequences for both individuals and communities (Glover et al. 2020, Coibion et al. 2020). Therefore, rather than a prolonged period of strict distancing until treatment or immunisation make social gatherings safe, coexisting with the virus is most likely to entail the monitoring of local epidemiological curves and by a sequence of tighter and looser restrictions moving in sync with such curves. It is therefore important to identify what factors are associated with individuals and communities being able to alter their behaviour either voluntarily or in compliance with regulations.

Evidence from the H1N1 pandemic reveals that the likelihood that individuals implemented behavioural changes in 2009 to reduce H1H1 transmission depended, among other things, on their social capital (Chuang et al. 2015; Rönnerstrand 2013, 2014). Social capital reflects the resources and benefits that individuals and groups acquire through connections with others and involves both shared norms and values that promote cooperation as well as actual social relationships (Kawachi et al. 2008).

Evidence on the role of social capital in shaping behavioural responses during the COVID-19 pandemic is beginning to emerge (see Borgonovi and Andrieu 2020, Bargain and Aminjonov 2020, Durante et al. 2020). We contribute to this line of work by examining data from US counties to identify how communities with different levels of social capital responded to the threat posed by COVID-19 by changing one type of behaviour: mobility. We examine mobility patterns between 17 February, when there was little awareness of the public health threat posed by COVID-19 among the general population in the US, and 10 May, by which point as many as 1.3 million individuals had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and about 80 thousand were reported to have died because of COVID-19.

Data on county-level social capital come from the “The geography of social capital” project and mobility data come from the Cuebiq's Mobility Index (CMI). Data from Cuebiq has been used to map movements in Italian provinces prior to and following the implementation of restrictions to movement because of COVID-19.

Figure 1 reveals that both communities with high levels of social capital (counties in top quarter of the social capital index) and communities with low levels of social capital (counties in bottom quarter of the index) changed their mobility patterns between 17 February and 10 May. Mobility was already lower at baseline in areas with higher levels of social capital and decreased markedly in such areas from the week starting on 9 March onwards. Such communities reduced mobility sooner than communities with lower levels of social capital, i.e. when reducing mobility was not yet legally mandated. These communities also reduced mobility to a much greater extent than communities with lower levels of social capital. Mobility returned close to baseline in both high and low social capital communities by 10 May, although observing mobility levels in mid-May that are comparable to those observed in February should be viewed as a form of behavioural change: mobility tends to be greater when the days are longer and weather conditions are more favourable to outdoor activities.

Figure 1 Changes in mobility in US counties in high and low social capital communities

Results presented in Figure 1 do not consider differences across counties with different levels of social capital which may also shape behavioural responses during the pandemic. In Figure 2, we highlight the weekly evolution in mobility differentials across counties that are associated with a one standard deviation difference in social capital after accounting for county-level characteristics (weather conditions, the number of COVID-19 cases diagnosed the week before, if the county was subject to shelter-in-place orders in the week under analysis, the percentage of votes cast that were in favour of Trump in the 2016 presidential elections, the primary economic activity of the county, population density, the share of people over 65, and the share of people living in poverty) as well as state fixed effects.

Figure 2 Social capital differentials in mobility between 17 February and 10 May in the US

Notes: The balanced panel covers 2715 counties which account for 96% of the total US population in 2018. All models are based on Cuebiq Mobility trends data. Dependent variable: mobility index. The figure highlights the change in mobility associated with a one standard deviation difference in social capital while accounting for weather conditions (precipitations), the number of covid-19 cases diagnosed the week before, if the county was subject to shelter-in-place orders in the week, the percentage of votes cast that were in favour of Trump in the 2016 presidential elections, the economic dependence of the county (reference category undifferentiated economic activity), population density, the share of people over 65, and the share of people in poverty.

Figure 2 illustrates the average within state, between county variation in mobility between 17 February and 10 May that is associated with a difference of one standard deviation in social capital. It indicates that the social capital differential in mobility became very large between March and 13 April and decreased from 13 April on but remained statistically significant. This result should be considered in light of Figure 1: at the start of the study period the differential occurred while levels of mobility were declining while at the end of the study period the differential occurred when overall mobility levels were increasing. Crucially, the social capital differential grew before shelter-in-place orders were implemented.

Because behavioural changes in the early stages of COVID-19 are crucial to halt the spread of the virus before cases start to rise exponentially (Dave et al. 2020) these findings are particularly relevant. They also indicate that although sheltering-in-place orders can effectively alter individual behaviours across all communities, they are especially effective in communities with high levels of social capital.

In order to evaluate the likely risk different communities face because of COVID-19 we combine information on community-level social capital and the prevalence of chronic conditions such as diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, lung disease, and heart disease in the population. Individuals with pre-existing conditions are in fact more likely to face complications if infected with COVID-19 (Jordan 2020). We consider counties with a high prevalence of chronic conditions and low levels of social capital to be very vulnerable while counties with a low prevalence of chronic conditions and high levels of social capital to have low levels of vulnerability. Figure 3 indicate that many counties, particularly in the Southeast, face very high levels of vulnerability, combining high rates of chronic conditions and low levels of social capital.

Sources: Author’s calculations based on data from www.policymap.com (risk index) and “The geography of social capital” (social capital index).

Our findings may be important not only to evaluate what happened in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, but also to consider where efforts should be put as legal barriers to the SARS-CoV-2 virus are relaxed. Governments around the world have lifted some of the restrictions to movement that were implemented in February and March 2020 when the number of COVID-19 cases rapidly increased. Our work suggests that the stock of social capital in a community is a crucial factor. Reinforcing the social capital available in a community when this is present and supporting communities when social capital is lacking should be just as much of a priority as sourcing stocks of face masks or testing kits to protect population health.

2020-06-10|"Southland Stags player Scott Eade is the host of a new podcast that looks at all things rugby in Southland.

Stags player Scott Eade is shining a spotlight on Southland rugby as the skipper of a new podcast which has quickly attracted a strong fan following.

The 27-year-old has combined with fellow Marist clubmen Jeremy Boyle and UK-based Bryce Morgan to create The Brains Trust rugby pod, which describes itself as a look at all things rugby in the deep south, “a mix of serious footy chat with a bit of banter thrown in”.

At a time when rugby has been little more than a romantic memory and there was even less certainty about when, or even if, the season would get underway, the pod has scratched an itch and attracted about 2500 listeners after just eight episodes.

Not bad for what is a reasonably niche subject.

“We thought we’d just give it a crack and the first couple went alright, and so we’ve just stuck at it,” Eade told SouthlandSport.com.

Eade, who combines his rugby with a role as a development officer with Touch Southland, studied journalism after high school and has an interest in media generally.

He’s also become a fan of the podcast medium and when lockdown provided him with a bit more spare time, the gem of an idea, which he’d had for a while, sprouted.

While working for Rugby Southland as the union’s women’s development officer, Eade had seen the decline in club rugby coverage and began thinking about ways the void could be filled.

“We’ve had a few messages from people who know us or have enjoyed hearing about club footy. There’s quite a few boys who are from Southland but are living in Aussie or the UK, it gives them an idea of what’s going on back here,” Eade said.

“I suppose that’s given myself and now Jeremy and Bryce the motivation to keep going with it. Now that we are about to start the season, it will be good to get into some weekly wraps and get some guys on from different clubs and teams.”

Despite letting itself down somewhat with its unashamed green-and-black bias – full disclosure, I am a Blues supporter – the podcast has struck a delightful balance between the humourous, eg, the selection of a Southland all-time under 85kg team, and the serious, eg. the always contentious debate around the value of the Eastern-Northern Barbarians concept.

Another interesting recent debate centred around whether the standard of club rugby in Southland had declined over the past 20 years.

“When we started, we talked about the fact people don’t just want to listen to serious stuff,” Eade said.

“We have a bit of a laugh about things, but we don’t shy away from polarising topics. We had Ben McKerchar on last week, and he’s never short of a word. We knew that he would give his honest opinion.”

Another strength of a longer-form platform like a podcast is that it creates the time and space to develop a deeper story, as the Brains Trust has done with in-depth interviews with current and former Stags players Javaan Fa’amoe Ioane and Liam Howley.

It’s a chance to let the subject tell their own story, something that’s hard to encapsulate in 500 words.

The podcast has also provided Eade with a rugby outlet at a time when he’s desperately needed one.

His 2019 season came to an abrupt end at a Stags training run when he dislocated his shoulder so badly he had to go to hospital to get it put back in.

Surgery and then a long rehab followed. With the club season beckoning, Covid-19 stepped up and changed the game again.

“It’s felt like forever, to be fair, especially for me because I did my shoulder right back at the start of September last year. I was just in the process of getting back into playing and then [the pandemic] happened,” Eade said.

“There was that period when we weren’t even sure if we were going to play club and there were murmurs that there might not be a Mitre 10 Cup, or that Southland wouldn’t be in it. It’s exciting to be back with the Marist boys and just chucking a ball around really.”

Marist will take on Woodlands in a preseason game this weekend, another tangible sign that some sort of normality is returning to the Southland way of life.

Eade isn’t expecting to take over the world with the Brains Trust, but he’s interested to see where it goes next.

“I don’t really have any expectations of it getting too big, or anything. It was more just about entertaining people who have an interest in Southland rugby, want to listen to a few yarns and get an idea of what’s going on,” he said.

“We’ll just keep plugging away and hopefully a few people tune in.”

2020-06-11|"Bullish sentiment appears to have returned to the stock markets with a vengeance. In a historic rally that has taken even die-hard bulls by surprise, the S&P 500 has managed to claw back all of its 2020 losses, taking just 53 sessions for the index to fully restore the nearly $10T in value it shed in an epic bear market.

The oil markets have been nearly as impressive.

After entering negative territory for the first time in history, U.S. WTI prices have briefly touched $40/bbl amid record production cuts and an uptick in global demand. Oil and gas stocks have doubled from their March 23 nadir, marking a sharp reversal from the precipitous drop that wiped out nearly two decades of gains.

There’s no shortage of bottom fishing opportunities in this market, with shares of bankrupt or near-bankrupt shale companies including Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL), Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), California Resources Corp. (NYSE:CRC) and Valaris Plc (NYSE: VAL) as well as offshore drillers Borr Drilling Ltd (NYSE:BORR), Noble Corp.(NYSE:NE), Seadrill (NYSE:SDRL) and TransOcean (NYSE:RIG) recording triple-digit gains over the past week alone.

But analysts are now saying investors need to pump their brakes.

A cross-section of Wall Street has warned that there’s too much irrational exuberance in the markets, and the oil price rally is not fully supported by fundamentals.







Source: CNN Money

According to Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING, as well as analysts at Goldman Sachs, refining margins, aka crack spreads, across different regions around the globe are still way off their norms, portending continuing weak global demand for distillates.

U.S. crack spreads clocked in at a mere $9/bbl last week, compared to $21 at the same time last year according to Reuters, while crack spreads for European diesel dropped to a record low of $2.90.

Crack spreads are a good proxy for oil demand with falling spreads a sign of weak demand and vice-versa. The badly squeezed margins for refiners is a worrying sign that global demand remains way below normal levels, with the ongoing pick-up in crude prices only serving to worsen the margin contraction for the likes of Valero Energy Corp. (NYSE:VLO), Marathon Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:MPC) and Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX).

WTI and Brent prices have staged a strong rally over the past few weeks after production cuts by OPEC+ and independent producers in the U.S. and elsewhere helped ease a huge supply glut and storage buildup. On Saturday, OPEC and its allies agreed to extend the cuts by an additional month with plans to review progress on a monthly basis. Global oil demand particularly in the giant markets of China and India appears to be recovering at a faster-than-expected clip, with crude imports in China surging 13% in May to a record 11.3 million barrels per day and demand back to 90% of pre-crisis levels. Meanwhile, May sales in India were recorded at ~76% of normal levels while U.S. gasoline demand has seen a 7% uptick during the final week of May to clock in at 75% of pre-COVID-19 levels.

But analysts are now questioning whether the rebound in demand is the result of rising consumption or simply the result of refiners and traders stocking up on cheap crude.

ING’s Patterson and Ehsan Khoman at Japanese bank MUFG say the surge in demand could partly be the result of opportunistic buying by refiners. Consequently, Goldman has predicted that Brent prices will pull back to $35 per barrel in the coming weeks from a recent high of $43. According to Bloomberg, the United States’ largest refiner by capacity, Valero Energy, is currently running its two crude units at just 58% of their maximum rate of 424K bbl/day due to low demand and storage filling up. The refinery's fluid catalytic converter as well as all the hydrotreaters except the distillate hydrotreaters are running at minimum rates while rates on the coker have also been lowered. In a previous article, we reported that giant oil traders have been storing millions of barrels of crude in the seas with a view to selling when prices improve in the coming months, which could also be driving the surge in demand. At this juncture, it’s best for investors to adopt an attitude of cautious optimism. On one hand, the bulls argue that OPEC+ has curtailed production too fast, with some oil executives eyeing the seemingly untouchable WTI prices of $70 in the current year. On the other hand, poor refining margins are telling a different story while oil prices have, worryingly, been strongly pulling back from recent highs on fears that increased production by U.S. shale producers and Libya will offset the OPEC+ cuts. As many analysts have pointed out, the biggest wild card in this market remains the speed at which demand is going to bounce back in the coming months. The current evidence though appears to lend support to the bull camp."|1
2020-06-11|"The nationwide protests against police brutality and systemic racism have caused many long-standing American institutions to look inward and figure out how they can do the bare minimum to support the cause. The Marines have ordered the removal of Confederate flags from their bases; the Army has expressed openness to the idea of renaming bases named after Confederate generals; and now, the Navy has joined in with its own performative gesture .

CNN reports that an order is being crafted to ensure the removal of all Confederate iconography from Navy institutions. “The Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Mike Gilday, has directed his staff to begin crafting an order that would prohibit the Confederate battle flag from all public spaces and work areas aboard Navy installations, ships, aircraft and submarines,” Cmdr. Nate Christensen, Gilday’s spokesperson, said in a statement.



Initially, U.S. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley expressed openness to holding bipartisan discussions to rename approximately a dozen military bases named after Confederate generals—b ut President Trump shut that shit down with the quickness, though. In a series of tweets sent out Wednesday, the president said: “my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations…”

If I seem cynical about these moves, well, that’s because I am. While these are cute gestures, until the military makes active efforts to combat white nationalism within its ranks, the gestures will ring hollow. Last year, a measure designed to combat white nationalism in the armed forces had the phrase “white nationalism” removed. In March, an active duty member of the Army plotted with a white nationalist to bomb a Kansas City hospital as the COVID-19 pandemic intensified. There’s a clear problem here that the military just seems content to ignore."|1
2020-06-11|"Shubhangi, congratulations, you just defended your PhD, what was it on?

“I looked at how the active ingredients in drugs form crystals in liquids. Crystallisation is important for making and formulating many medicines, and I looked at the first step in the formation of these crystals, where I analysed how these molecules of the drug’s active ingredient cluster together.

What did it involve?

I did lots of experiments, thousands of them. I measured the size of molecular clusters of various active pharmaceutical ingredients, which changed with time due to clustering in different liquids under different conditions. It involved lots of calculations from those experiments too.

It is fundamental science, rather than applied, but the applications depend on knowing the fundamental science, so what I found should be helpful for industry.

How did you come to study that?

I did a primary degree and a master’s degree in nanotechnology in India, then I worked in Karlsruhe in Germany. I wanted to do a PhD, and was looking for projects online. I saw this one advertised in Limerick, so I applied, and I went out of my workplace to an internet cafe and did an online interview with Prof Åke Rasmuson in the department of chemical sciences at UL.

What was the toughest challenge of doing a PhD?

I think it was writing up the thesis. In one way, it was good timing because I wrote up a lot of it during the lockdown restrictions for Covid-19, so I didn’t feel I was missing out on a social life and I could get up late in the morning and work right through until after midnight, which suits me. Even still, the writing was challenging, but I think it really helped me to get a deeper understanding of my PhD, I needed to go through that.

Because of Covid-19, you did your PhD defence, or viva, online. How did that work?

Normally a PhD viva takes place in a room, where you have your professor and examiners present. But we couldn’t do that now because of Covid, so we did the viva over Skype. I was in Limerick, and my professor was in Sweden and my external examiner was in France and there were other examiners on the call too. I did a presentation and then the examiners asked me questions.

How did you feel before the PhD viva? I did mine 23 years ago, and I can still recall the terrifying pre-exam nerves!

I was really nervous. I couldn’t sleep the night before. I had prepared well for my presentation, but I felt like I was a different person presenting it, and then I had to answer the questions. It is a long exam, it takes hours, and I was very relieved when it was over.

What was the high point of the exam?

I think it was when they told me at the end that my presentation was excellent, that I got my PhD and that I didn’t have to make any corrections to my project. That means I can relax a bit!

Now that you have finished, what will you do for the next few months?

I had planned to go home and visit my family in India as I have not seen them for a year and a half, but I can’t go because of Covid. So I am going to apply for post-doctoral positions and jobs, and see what comes down the road next.”"|2
2020-06-11|"Once Hertz declared bankruptcy, the rental car company pushed a ton of their inventory onto the used car market. While some industry experts predicted this would cause a blow to used car values, prices have started to stabilize a little, but according to iSeeCars.com, you can still score some great deals buying from Hertz.

Millions of Americans are feeling the negative economic impact of Covid-19, and while states are slowly opening up and folks are returning to work, it’s hard to make up for lost income. Buyers that are in the market for a car would be wise to pivot to a cheaper pre-owned car. Indeed many car shoppers are doing just that, as the used car market is bouncing back while new car sales still lag. If you’re looking for a deal, buying from a rental fleet like Hertz could be a good move.

According to iSeeCars, vehicles in the Hertz fleet can often be a bit cheaper than the average market price for a similar used car.

iSeeCars analyzed over 20,000 used cars from model years 2017 to 2019 listed by Hertz Car Sales® in May 2020, to see which vehicles provide the biggest cost savings. Hertz vehicles can currently be found on average for $1,389 below market value, which is 43.3 percent more than the average discount for Hertz vehicles in April at $969. Some vehicles can be found with savings far greater than average.

However, the cars with the best savings seem to be luxury models, which may not be the right fit for budget-focused shoppers.

You might be surprised to see such low miles on excellent cars like the BMW 7 series or the Infiniti QX50, but renters don’t tend pay for the upgrade for a premium ride. Renting a car is generally just about getting there and getting back for most people.

Here is a sampling of 2019 740 models all with reasonable mileage for a rental car.



Considering the 7 series had a starting price of around $84,000 before options picking up a one-year-old example with plenty of warranty left for almost half-price is a heck of a value.

Hertz’s no-haggle price and return policy can ease the stress of shopping, especially in the more challenging, affordable segment (around $15,000), where dealers will play games and add fees in order to squeeze whatever they can out of the customer.

2020-06-11|"I , Jean-Paul Sartre, everything is complicated by the presence of the other team. Pierre Nkurunziza had ways of simplifying things. Burundi’s president, who died on June 8th, would travel with his football team, Hallelujah . At matches opponents would shy away from tackles. Some who did not were arrested—a terrifying experience in Mr Nkurunziza’s police state.

The despot’s foul play was apparent off the pitch, too. He became president in 2005, at the end of a civil war, ushering in hope that the country of 11m people could, like neighbouring Rwanda, enjoy some stability. But in 2015, at the end of his term limit, Mr Nkurunziza refused to go. His obstinacy set off tit-for-tat violence, assassinations, a failed coup and the displacement of 400,000 people.

“People hate him,” says a journalist in the country. “During his reign so many people died.” Mr Nkurunziza’s regime murdered and tortured opponents. Corruption and punitive taxes have further impoverished Burundians, 72% of whom live on less than the equivalent of $1.90 per day.

The president agreed not to run for a fourth term in elections in May. Instead he agreed to a new job title: Paramount Leader, Champion of Patriotism and Leadership Core. The vote was rigged in favour of Évariste Ndayishimiye, who is not scheduled to take office until August. Pascal Nyabenda, the speaker of the national assembly and Mr Nkurunziza’s first choice as successor, should fill in as interim president.

Mr Nkurunziza had wanted to run the country from behind the scenes. Now possible rivalry between an interim president and the president-elect could create instability. Then there is the regional picture. Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda have long waged proxy wars in eastern Congo. A power vacuum in Burundi presents a chance for further meddling in its affairs.

The president’s death may, though, allow the country to face up to another pressing issue. He ignored covid-19 and turfed out experts from the World Health Organisation, saying that God would protect Burundi. This may have been his downfall. The government says he died of a heart attack, but local sources whisper that he succumbed to covid-19. His wife was reportedly in Kenya for treatment. His death gives Burundi a chance to tackle the pandemic—and, perhaps, of a bit less foul play. ■"|1
2020-06-11|"Public debt has risen to unprecedented peacetime levels, due to policies put into place to address the economic fallout from COVID-19. Nevertheless, as this column reveals, the Centre for Macroeconomics panel was nearly unanimous that the Treasury should not take any action to decrease the deficit in the upcoming budget. The panel is split on when it would be wise to publicly announce long-run plans to address the deficit and the debt. The majority of the panel supports a mix of financing options when action is taken, with tax increases receiving strong support and not a single panellist supporting public spending cuts.

The UK government has supported the economy with a variety of measures in response to the COVID-19 crisis. This has led to an unprecedented increase in public deficits in peacetime. The Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts a budget deficit of £300 billion this year, more than 15% of UK GDP. Public debt is expected to exceed 100% of GDP by the end of the year. Despite this increased borrowing, the UK government is borrowing at negative rates for horizons of up to three years and can currently borrow at 50-year maturities for less than half a percent annually.

Internal Treasury documents indicate that the Exchequer has begun planning measures to reduce the deficit in upcoming years. Goodhart and Pradhan (2020) predict rising inflation if public and private debts aren’t addressed. Others have suggested that it is premature to take action or even commence planning for deficit reduction. Nick Macpherson, a former top Treasury official, said: “You don’t want to have a Budget while the crisis is in full throttle.” Paul Johnson of the Institute of Fiscal Studies suggests waiting until the end of 2021, “once we have a better idea how well the economy has recovered.” The Economist has also opined that “rich-world governments will make a big mistake if they succumb to premature and excessive worries about budgets.”

In this month’s CfM survey, panellists were asked about the urgency of deficit reduction and how this deficit reduction should be achieved.

Question 1 How urgently should the UK government address the rise in public debt?

Thirty panellists responded to this question. The panel was nearly unanimous (one dissent) that no measures should be taken in the upcoming budget. The vast majority of the panel (63%) stated that there was no need to take any action or announce budgetary changes to address public debt until the pandemic subsided. The remaining panellists were split on whether the government should present concrete plans sooner rather than later (20%) or that focus on the public debt was counterproductive (13%).

Uncertainty on the scale and duration of the pandemic and its economic consequences was the main argument for postponing the discussion on public debt. David Cobham (Heriot-Watt University) thinks it “[b]est to wait until some of the dust at least has settled, otherwise we can't see what we're doing.” Thorsten Beck (Cass Business School) elaborated that at this stage, “it is not even clear how long the pandemic will last and how many waves there will be and what the ultimate economic cost will be.” Panellists furthermore didn’t see room for concern that requires immediate action. Wouter Den Haan (London School of Economics) notes that “we know countries like the UK can deal with high debt levels and right now there are obviously more important concerns.” Some participants, like John Van Reenen (London School of Economics) views austerity during the global financial crisis as a mistake, from which we should now learn.

Those supporting long-term plans raised concerns that ignoring the deficit entirely would create uncertainty that might hamper the recovery. Ricardo Reis (London School of Economics) notes that “having a clear long-term plan for fiscal policy would anchor expectations. It would remove one of the usually bigger sources of uncertainty for investment.” Kate Barker (British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme) suggests that instead of a plan, “HMT should introduce a few measures but launch a consultation on the pace of deficit reduction and tax and spend measures.” She also notes that this would be an opportunity to address some longer-term challenges: “The National Infrastructure Statement is needed to help with recovery and the way forward on climate change. And it would be very appropriate for a proper policy on social care finally to get the priority it deserves.” While only 20% of panellists supported long-term plans to address the deficit, a few supporters of the majority view implied in their comments that long-term fiscal plans would be wise.

The minority opposing plans to address the public debt in the foreseeable future instead expressed concern that excessive focus on the public debt would come at the expense of aiding the recovery. Simon Wren-Lewis (University of Oxford), for example, opposes any budgetary deficit reduction unless interest rates begin to rise. Wendy Carlin (University College London) also asked that the discussion be shifted from public debt concerns to “minimizing the damage to education, R&D, investment, start-ups etc. and on supporting incomes until economic activity can resume.”

A debate has emerged on financing methods for the massive increases in government debt worldwide. The most direct way to reduce deficits is by cutting public spending or increasing tax revenues. The Treasury’s internal estimates suggest that freezing public sector pay for two years would lead to savings of £6.5 billion by 2023-24. The Social Market Foundation points to the generous indexing of public pensions (the triple lock) as an attractive target for spending reductions. Although the Conservative Party manifesto promised no increases in income, VAT, or National Insurance taxes, the Treasury is contemplating tax hikes. The Chancellor has indicated that the crisis might be an opportunity to increase self-employment National Insurance tax rates to better align with those of wage earners. The Labour manifesto called for wealth taxation even prior to the pandemic, although support for such measures from Labour’s new leadership is yet to be seen. The Financial Times provides a useful summary and a podcast on the panoply of budgetary measures that could be used to reduce the public debt.

Debt reduction efforts following WWII point to other debt reduction strategies. Public debts of high-income countries eroded through a combination of higher inflation and artificially low interest rates supported by regulatory measures such as capital controls (financial repression). A number of commentators have advocated a return to these practices. Adam Tooze points to these historical experiences and proposes direct monetary financing of deficits: “Under ordinary circumstances one might worry about that causing inflation. But given the recession we face that is a risk worth running. Indeed modest inflation would help us by taking a bite out of the real value of the debt.” Willem Buiter has suggested that increasing inflation targets to 5% would do the trick, but notes little appetite for such policies in high-income countries.

Following the Napoleonic Wars, the UK took a different approach of issuing consols (or perpetual bonds). The US took a similar approach following the Civil War and the UK issued some consols following WWI. These are bonds that never mature, but whose coupons are serviced indefinitely. George Soros has advocated issuing consols to address COVID-19-related public debt and the Spanish government has proposed these debt instruments as a way to finance recovery efforts in the euro area (see also Giavazzi and Tabellini 2020 and Verhofstadt and Garicano’s April 15 editorial; Corsetti et al. 2020 argue against these instruments). Current yields on UK bonds are at unprecedented lows.

Economic growth could reduce the deficit and debt as a share of GDP, but it is unclear which policies would guarantee higher economic growth in current circumstances.

In this regard, the CfM panel was asked:

Question 2 What is the best way to (eventually) reduce public deficits and debt?

Thirty panellists responded to this question. Many respondents supported a policy mix that involves more than one of the proposed policies. Several respondents expressed hopes that economic growth would do its share in reducing the effective size of the public debt. In ranking individual policies, respondents were nearly equally split between those supporting tax increases and those supporting the issuance of perpetual bonds, with 30% support for each, although supporters of tax increases expressed greater confidence. A smaller share (13%) supported higher inflation. Not a single panellist expressed support for public spending increases (or financial repression).

Supporters of tax increases noted that the UK public sector, whose importance the COVID-19 crisis has further underlined, has been stretched for some time. Tony Yates (University of Birmingham) argues that “a larger and more resilient state is likely to be needed to put us in a better position to fight future pandemics, and also to redress some for the regressive aspects of them.” Jagjit Chadha (National Institute of Economic and Social Research) notes that “we have a sustained increase in the demand for the provision of public goods.” Kate Barker (British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme) suggests that higher taxation might be necessary to support the economic recovery. She writes: “There is a high risk that the better-off will continue to save more - taxing in order to support demand may be important - and in the longer run part of the deficit reduction.” Andrew Mountford (Royal Holloway) suggested specific tax measures, including “property tax as the most efficient way to do so and to use the revenues not only for debt reduction but also for substantial public investments.”

2020-06-11|"Northern Ireland’s health minister, Robin Swann, has criticised the Government in Dublin for its failure to keep the Executive in Belfast informed of its plan for easing lockdown restrictions. He has a point.

This has been a recurring problem. After First Minister Arlene Foster complained rather justifiably that she and her colleagues had learned of the Republic’s lockdown plans through the media, and amidst concerns about the divergent approaches to the pandemic on both sides of the Border, the authorities in Dublin and Belfast were eager to show determination to coordinate better.

In April a Memorandum of Understanding was agreed between North and South which recognised a “compelling case for strong co-operation, including information-sharing and, where appropriate, a common approach”. When the Government announced its accelerated roadmap last Friday, it said the Executive was informed in advance. But this appears to have been no more than a courtesy call.

The authorities in Northern Ireland made serious errors early on in the pandemic. Some, such as the failure to carry out community testing and set up a contact tracing system, were the result of a policy reliance on London, whose approach to the pandemic has been muddled and chaotic. But important strides have been made since then.

A rapprochement between Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill produced a useful model that reflected Northern Ireland’s own needs. The compromise was that the DUP accepted a plan closer to the Republic than to Britain, while Sinn Féin accepted the principle of a bespoke plan for the North. No deaths from coronavirus have been reported in the North in four days.

We are in a dangerous moment, reopening society while the virus still circulates among us. Radically differing approaches North and South would leave everyone on the island more vulnerable. If the Government means what it says about the importance of cross-Border coordination, then it should make a genuine effort to work with the Executive."|1
2020-06-11|"The Australian dollar was the greatest beneficiary of renewed risk appetite overnight, as US equity markets were buoyed by the FOMC’s dovish monetary policy statement. The AUD has round-tripped from 0.6980 to touch 11-month highs of 0.7063 before retreating into this mornings’ open with the pair currently oscillating around the 0.7000 handle. Despite the NZD also benefiting from the risk rally, AUD/NZD was able to rise from 1.0680 to 1.0730 overnight.

With the AUD/USD’s tight correlation with global equity markets still intact, the Aussie’s rally was largely unsurprising as the FED’s dovish monetary policy statement stimulated US equities. The US central bank left the policy rate unchanged at 0%-0.25%, delivered lower inflation and growth forecasts and made no mention of slowing down its policy stimulus even as equity markets rally.

Thursday is set to be a pretty quiet day. On the data front, we have MI inflation expectations for June on the domestic docket before retail card spending across the pond. Neither of which are expected to be market movers. Attentions will then turn the May PPI and jobless claims out of the world’s largest economy. Given the AUD/USD’s current consolidation around the 70c mark, a continuation of the Aussie’s recent uptrend could see it test 0.7080 on the topside whilst downside moves are expected to meet initial resistance at 0.6989.

As we touched on above, the major story overnight was the dovish monetary policy statement from the FOMC. The worlds largest economy opted to maintain its current monetary policy stance, continue its COVID 19 stimulus packages and lowered its CPI and growth forecasts. The moves translated into a weaker USD in currency markets, allowing the EUR, GBP and JPY to all rise against the greenback.

The EUR was able to break through the 1.14 mark overnight as it rose from 1.345 to 1.1422, representing a three-month high. The sterling also broke through 1.28 with USD/JPY falling to trade below 107.

Global markets will be looking towards the US may PPI and initial jobs claims numbers which are due out tonight before attentions turn to Friday’s session. Friday delivers Industrial production data out of New Zealand, Japan, the UK and the Eurozone. WE will also see UK GDP and trade balance data for April before US consumer confidence and JOLTS jobs data for April to round out the week.

2020-06-12|"The cost of staying open: Voluntary social distancing and lockdowns in the US

Lockdown policies have been found to be effective in promoting social distancing and slowing down the spread of COVID-19. Yet, such measures are often blamed for downturns in the economy. This column argues that the lockdowns in the US are in fact efficient in minimising the costs of the epidemic, once both the economic and medical burden that would arise in the absence of such policies are considered. Estimates from a controlled SIR model, which includes the possibility for changes in behaviour, suggest that lockdowns reduce the costs of the pandemic by at least 1.7% of annual GDP compared to a no-lockdown scenario.

With few exceptions, governments around the world have implemented lockdown policies in order to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Public debates over the costs of such measures have typically assumed that the extent to which populations socially distance, and the associated economic costs, are mostly within the government's control. What is largely missing in these debates, however, is the recognition that the economic costs of the pandemic will be substantial even in the absence of lockdowns, since the spread of the virus causes a significant increase in voluntary social distancing (Chudik et al. 2020, Brzezinski et al. 2020a). This suggests that the counterfactual additional costs of a lockdown might be lower than commonly assumed.

Indeed, in a recent paper (Brzezinski et al. 2020b), we find that lockdown policies have been economically more efficient than staying open in the US. To obtain these results, we combine microeconometric methods with an epidemiological model that allows for societal and political response to the virus in order to estimate the costs and benefits of lockdown policies.

Our argument builds on two pillars:
• First, we find that the additional economic costs due to lockdowns are relatively low, once accounting for the voluntary response that would occur in the absence of such policies. This is in line with forecasts for 2020, which predict similar contractions in most developed countries (European Commission 2020) even if they did not impose lockdown measures, like Sweden. It also aligns with earlier research that showed credit card consumption only marginally less in Sweden, than in neighbouring Denmark, which did lock down (Andersen et al. 2020). Research on unemployment data from the US further suggests that only one fourth of the claims has been caused by lockdowns (Baek et al. 2020).
• Second, the medical benefits of a lockdown are high because of the high hospitalisation rate of COVID-19. Taken together, our findings indicate that lockdown measures generate efficiency gains in terms of medical expenditures that offset the comparatively small economic losses caused by lockdown policies.

We leverage daily county-level mobile phone data on movement patterns to study the impact of local outbreaks and lockdown policies on mobility. These data are considered crucial in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 (Oliver et al. 2020) and have been used in a wide range of applications (Allcott et al. 2020, Andersen 2020).

Our events of interest are the first county-level case and state-level stay-at-home orders issued over the course of March and April 2020. These allow us to estimate the voluntary and lockdown responses to an outbreak, respectively.[1] Due to the gradual occurrence of these events across the US, we are able to construct viable counterfactual scenarios using difference-in-differences designs. Our outcome variable of interest is the percentage of devices that stay home all day.

Figure 1 shows the estimated uptake in social distancing following the first COVID-19 case by state. The horizontal line indicates the estimated coefficient for the US as a whole, while the points correspond to state-specific estimates. Overall, the share of people that stayed home all day increased by around 1.8 percentage points in the US. This constitutes an increase of 5.1% compared to February 2020. As reduced mobility maps into lower economic activity, this implies that economic costs are inevitable even in the absence of lockdown measures.

Notes: The figure plots the difference-in-differences estimate for the change in the percentage of devices that stay completely at home following the first case in a county. Blue (red) lines correspond to Democratic (Republican) states as per the 2016 presidential election; dashed lines indicate parameters that are insignificant at p<0.05; confidence level: 95%.

This substantial uptake in social distancing is comparable in magnitude to citizens' response to lockdown orders. Using a similar approach, our results show that the additional lockdown-induced impact on social distancing is 5.3%. Thus, governments that rely solely on voluntary social distancing need to take into account that the behavioural change will be significantly smaller without a lockdown policy in place, but will nonetheless still lead to sizeable decreases in activity.

How do these patterns in social distancing map into medical and economic costs? We answer this question by studying a controlled SIR model (Gros et al. 2020) (the acronym stands for Susceptible – Infected – Recovered). In addition to the standard epidemiological SIR model, this framework introduces the possibility for changes in behaviour, such as social distancing, which influence the rate at which the virus reproduces. This additional parameter can be interpreted as the joint social and political effort to promote social distancing and therefore to mitigate the spread of the virus. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the model allows us to split the reaction strength into the components related to voluntary and mandated social distancing. Then, based on the previously estimated coefficients, we simulate the outbreak for both a lockdown and a no-lockdown scenario.

Based on these simulations, we separately estimate the economic and medical costs arising from the pandemic. The medical costs are composed of the production loss due to infected workers going on sick leave and the medical expenses associated with infections. These costs are directly proportional to the number of infections over the course of the pandemic.[2] The economic costs depend negatively on the degree of social distancing, which can be measured by the relative decrease in the reproduction number. Overall, the model reflects the trade-off faced by governments between balancing medical and economic costs. Less-restrictive policies increase medical costs through the total number of infected individuals, while lowering the burden from reduced economic activity.

The medical and economic cost estimates are presented in Figure 2 for a selection of US states that imposed lockdowns. It shows the costs in terms of GDP per capita associated with the estimated total containment response (T) and the counterfactual voluntary response (V).[3] For the US as a whole, we estimate that COVID-19 generates costs of around 13.9% of annual GDP per capita under a laissez-faire scenario compared to 12.2% if a lockdown is imposed.[4] In other words, imposing a country-wide lockdown would reduce the loss incurred by as much as 1.7% over the course of the pandemic compared to a no-lockdown scenario.

The finding that lockdowns are efficient in lowering the overall costs holds consistently across all states considered.[5] Decreasing the measured containment response by lifting a lockdown would only marginally increase the economic costs, while at the same time drastically increasing the medical costs. This pattern is more pronounced in states where the overall containment response was insufficiently effective, such as New York, Delaware and Massachusetts. In these states, voluntary social distancing leads to relatively larger decreases in economic costs compared to states with more efficient containment responses such as Vermont and New Mexico. Yet, the small reductions in economic activity are more than outweighed by the much larger relative increases in medical costs.

Notes: The figure shows estimated costs under voluntary social distancing (V) compared to total social distancing (T) – which includes voluntary (V) and lockdown-induced reductions (L) in movement. Estimated costs for (T) are based on simulations of the discretized C-SIR model. Costs for (V) are re-estimated with α scaled by the estimated ratio V/(V+L) = V/T. Costs are in terms of GDP per capita. Costs for both (V) and (T) are broken down into economic (red) and medical (blue).

We provide evidence for the efficiency of lockdown policies in mitigating both the overall costs to the economy as well as the spread of COVID-19. The reason for this is that individuals engage in voluntary social distancing even in the absence of lockdowns, once the virus takes hold in their area. Hence, substantial economic costs are unavoidable, even when not locking down. Yet, the additional lockdown-induced social distancing plays an important role in preventing further medical costs. Indeed, for our estimates of the voluntary and mandated social distancing responses, all US states that imposed a lockdown would have incurred larger overall costs had they stayed open. Considering the correct counterfactual costs is therefore key in informing policy decisions during potential future waves of COVID-19.

2020-06-12|"After my grant application was rejected, I needed something to cheer me up. I found it in three crucial words in the ‘Going to work’ section of the UK government’s catchily titled document ‘Staying alert and safe (social distancing)’, published on 11 May. The words in question were “and scientific research”. They signalled the phased lifting of some aspects of lockdown in England; specifically, they paved the way for a limited return to work for scientists who work in wet laboratories and cannot work from home.

The priority for reopening the laboratory is ensuring that it is safe for everyone. My lab is lucky to have experience in assessing the risk of infection from viral pathogens because we work with them routinely — admittedly from a safety cabinet and in full personal protective equipment. Importantly, each person’s final decision on whether to go into the lab is down to that individual, and no one is under any pressure to return. The riskiest part of reopening isn’t found in the lab at all: it is the use of public transport, where people are in much closer contact, to get to the lab.

Coronavirus and COVID-19: Keep up to date

I’m excited about the prospect of the lab reopening, even at reduced capacity. I would very much like to return to doing new science now. We have exciting questions that I want to answer: does Sophie’s vaccine work, will Emily’s wonder-drug kill all microbes, will David’s DNA do the deal, is Katie’s RNA stable? And there are numerous side projects and collaborations that, if I had some time, I could restart.

However, not every research scientist across the country will be able to come back immediately. For parents and caregivers in the United Kingdom, until schools and nurseries reopen for all children, it is going to be extremely difficult to physically return to work.

Getting labs up and running again will not be immediate, especially for those that were completely shuttered. Experiments take time to coax back to life. In this respect, my group is in a slightly different situation, because we are not returning to an empty lab. We share space with Robin Shattock, an immunologist at Imperial College London, and his amazing team, who have been leading the charge on one of the United Kingdom’s COVID-19 vaccine candidates. People have been in the lab continually, working at a sensible, safe distance from each other. On the two occasions that I have been back, the lab looked more or less the same as it did before. Even more importantly, Charlie in the molecular-diagnostics lab has, between developing and running COVID-19 detection tests, coaxed my lemon tree back to life.

What does reopening more of the lab mean for me personally? As someone who didn’t spend a significant proportion of their time in the lab, it will not lead to much change. I can do most of my job from home, so am condemned to do so. It certainly doesn’t mean an instant return to pre-2020 work practices, as evidenced by the fact that I wrote the first draft of this from my allotment, while loosely childminding, and not from my office at Imperial, while loosely supervising. Getting back to normal will be a very long process.

For those of you returning imminently, I can share some of my experiences of the limited return to work I have made. On the occasions I’ve returned to the lab, one of the things I have noticed is anxiety. It is like the beginning of the school year after a long summer holiday: will I still know what I am doing, will people still like me, will I still like them, will I remember not to call the teacher mummy? The easiest way around this anxiety is to jump straight in and get to grips with the matter in hand. Being busy is one of the best ways to stop overthinking. If need be, do a small, simple experiment just to blow away the cobwebs of imposter syndrome.

The reopening of some lab activity does mean that, in the United Kingdom, we are moving to a different phase. We are in the end of the beginning. I am not a modeller, so I have no inkling of where this path leads us. There is the distinct possibility that infections will rise again, and we will enter a second cycle of lockdown. I need to manage my own expectations as much as my team’s that, no sooner than picking them up, we might have to down our pipettes again."|2
2020-06-12|"The grudging tone emanating from those involved in the talks on government formation and the glacial pace of progress do not auger well for the future of the three-party coalition struggling to be born. The decision of Green Party deputy leader Catherine Martin to challenge Eamon Ryan for the leadership has added another layer of confusion and distrust to a process that was already being regarded with suspicion by a significant number of people in all of the three parties taking part in the process.

There is still some doubt about whether the talks will finally conclude with an agreement this weekend although the general expectation is that they have gone too far to end in failure. Even if there is agreement there is no guarantee that it will be ratified by a two-thirds majority of Green Party members. That will depend to a large degree on whether the party’s 12 TDs give it their enthusiastic backing.

So far a number of them have given the impression that being in coalition with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil is the last place they want to be and a number of people in the other two parties share that sentiment with regard to the Greens. “Even if Eamon Ryan manages to drag the Greens to the altar this has all the signs of a loveless marriage in the making. You have to ask how long it is going to last,” remarked one Fine Gael politician.

The scale of the problems facing the country in the post Covid-19 world will require a government that has the ability to take decisive action which will inevitably generate vociferous opposition from political opponents and constant media criticism. Surviving the pressure will require strong nerves and strong personal bonds between the party leaders as well as a mood of trust among ministers.

Unless a new cabinet is able to unite in a spirit of solidarity behind a programme for government the tensions which have characterised the negotiating process are likely to re-emerge. That is why a bad start will undermine any chance of dealing successfully with the country’s problems, however long the government lasts.

The record of past coalitions may be some guide to the pitfalls that await if one of the parties lacks wholehearted commitment. A classic example is the Fine Gael-Labour coalition of the 1980s led by Garret FitzGerald and Dick Spring which took over the country after the appalling mismanagement of the public finances by Charles Haughey.

From the beginning a significant element of the Labour Party, most notably current President Michael D Higgins and Kildare TD Emmet Stagg, opposed going into coalition and subsequently did everything possible to make life difficult for Spring and his colleagues in government.

Just 18 months into the lifetime of the government Spring almost lost control of his party at its annual conference when he only defeated the anti-coalition faction by 363 votes to 324. Higgins, then party chairman, led the frontal assault denouncing coalition with “the redneck fundamentalists” of Fine Gael.

Having to deal with such inveterate opponents of coalition meant that Spring effectively had one hand tied behind his back and could not agree to the kind of difficult measures that were needed to drag the country out of recession. The diary of Fine Gael minister for education Gemma Hussey gives a flavour of the kind of tensions that beset that government.

When the worsening state of the public finances prompted cuts in food subsidies in the summer of 1984 there was a political storm. “Appalling flack going on about the food subsidies. The hysteria from Michael D Higgins, Joe Higgins of the Labour left, John Carroll [trade union leader], the housewives, you name it, as well as Fianna Fáil’s Michael O’Kennedy being extremely rude on radio. The media are totally gone off mad.”

The miracle of that government was that it managed to survive four years and did have some notable achievements to its credit but it was unable to do what ministers knew needed to be done about the economy. The lesson is that if the Greens go into coalition divided from the start the government will be distracted by interminable internal party wrangling.

A more hopeful example of how a coalition can work well was the three-party coalition of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left that held office from late 1994 until 1997 after the tumultuous events that brought Albert Reynolds crashing down. Many forecast disaster for the only government formed without an election, particularly because of past tensions between taoiseach John Bruton, tánaiste Dick Spring and Democratic Left leader Proinsias De Rossa.

In the event it was a reasonably happy and a successful government which left the country it a better position than it found it with the first budget surplus in a generation. The key to its success was the level of trust between the party leaders and the discipline shown by the TDs of the three parties in keeping the focus on the big issues and refusing to be panicked by every passing storm. If the new government can follow that example it might succeed but it will need to put the difficult birth behind it as quickly as possible."|1
2020-06-13|"WASHINGTON - In a move applauded by President Donald Trump’s conservative religious base, his administration on Friday finalized a rule that overturns Obama-era protections for transgender people against sex discrimination in health care.

The Department of Health and Human Services said it will enforce sex discrimination protections “according to the plain meaning of the word ‘sex’ as male or female and as determined by biology.” This rewrites an Obama-era regulation that sought a broader understanding shaped by a person’s internal sense of being male, female, neither or a combination.

LGBTQ groups say explicit protections are needed for people seeking sex-reassignment treatment, and even for transgender people who need care for common illnesses such as diabetes or heart problems.

But conservatives say the Obama administration exceeded its legal authority in broadly interpreting gender.

The reversal comes in the middle of LGBTQ Pride Month. Activists and Democratic lawmakers noted that Friday was also the four-year anniversary of the mass shooting at the Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in which 49 people were killed.

Behind the dispute over legal rights is a medically recognized condition called “gender dysphoria” — discomfort or distress caused by a discrepancy between the gender that a person identifies as and the gender at birth. Consequences can include severe depression. Treatment can range from sex-reassignment surgery and hormones to people changing their outward appearance by adopting a different hairstyle or clothing.

Many social conservatives disagree with the concept.

“Under the old Obama rule, medical professionals could have been forced to facilitate gender reassignment surgeries and abortions — even if they believed this was a violation of their conscience or believed it harmful to the patient,” said Mary Beth Waddell of the religious conservative Family Research Council.

But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, “Religious freedom is no justification for hatred or bigotry, and every American has the right to seek and receive care without intimidation or fear.”

The American Medical Association strongly criticized the Trump administration’s action.

“The federal government should never make it more difficult for individuals to access health care — during a pandemic or any other time,“ said Dr. Susan Bailey, the group’s president.

Under the Obama-era rule, a hospital could be required to perform gender-transition procedures such as hysterectomies if the facility provided that kind of treatment for other medical conditions. The rule was meant to carry out the anti-discrimination section of the Affordable Care Act, which bars sex discrimination in health care but does not use the term “gender identity.”

Women’s groups say the new regulations also undermine access to abortion, which is a legal medical procedure.

“No one should fear being turned away by a medical provider because of who they are or the personal health decisions they have made,” said Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women’s Law Center.

The ACLU says it has already moved to try to prevent the rollback of protections for transgender people. The LGBTQ civil rights group Lambda Legal said it will sue.

More than 1.5 million Americans identify as transgender, according to the Williams Institute, a think-tank focusing on LGBT policy at the UCLA School of Law. A bigger number — 4.5% of the population— identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, according to Gallup.

Roger Severino, head of the HHS unit that enforces civil rights laws, said transgender people continue to be protected by other statutes that bar discrimination in health care on account of race, colour, national origin, age, disability and other factors.

“Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and according to the law,” said Severino. “Our dedication to our civil rights laws is as strong as ever.” He cited recent actions to safeguard access to treatment for disabled people in the coronavirus pandemic.

For the Trump administration it’s the latest in a series of steps to revoke newly won protections for LGBTQ people in areas ranging from the military to housing and education.

The administration also has moved to restrict military service by transgender men and women, proposed allowing certain homeless shelters to take gender identity into account in offering someone a bed for the night, and concluded in a 2017 Justice Department memo that federal civil rights law does not protect transgender people from discrimination at work.

The new rule would also affect the notices that millions of patients get in multiple languages about their rights to translation services. Such notices often come with insurer “explanation of benefits” forms. The Trump administration says the notice requirement has become a needless burden on health care providers, requiring billions of paper notices to be mailed annually at an estimated five-year cost of $2.9 billion."|1
2020-06-13|"Principals and deputy principals all around the country are wondering how on earth they are going to re-open their schools at the end of August. While everyone is anxious to facilitate a return to face-to face teaching, the logistics are challenging. Meanwhile, the recent reopening of UK primary schools was a shambles. In the first week, only 52 per cent managed to reopen and only 11 per cent of pupils attended. Several schools reopened and had to close again immediately for deep cleaning because a pupil or teacher was infected.

Irish principals and deputy principals have been working flat out since the lockdown and there is no end in sight. They are currently supervising calculated grades for Leaving Certs, which is an unprecedented pressure even if few parents are attempting to lobby.

Many of them would in other years have the timetable for next year done or mostly done. A normal timetable makes three-dimensional Sudoku look like a snap. Not only is the timetable not ready, but principals have no idea what kind of timetable to formulate.

For example, while it will be very, very difficult for primary schools to reopen, there is one teacher and perhaps a special needs assistant or two per class. In secondary schools with 40-minute class periods, pupils can have nine different teachers in a single day, and no two days of the week are alike. Even in schools with one-hour periods, students will have up to six teachers.

Experts currently believe that, under existing guidelines, schools will only be able to have 50 per cent of their student body in the building at one time.

Some subjects have three periods a week, like history. It is conceivable that if one half of a year is in the school on alternate days, a class might end up with one period in a subject.

The complications do not end there. What about the other half who are at home? There has been vague talk of teachers broadcasting (or more accurately, narrowcasting) their classes as they teach.

How? Teaching is not lecturing. In theory, you could set a camera in a lecture theatre and the lecture could be delivered from one point.

At second level, a teacher talking for 40 minutes or an hour is a very bad class. Students should be active, interacting with the material, each other and the teacher. Good luck with capturing that with one iPad perched on the teacher’s desk.

Schools are not set up to work in this way. They do not have the necessary equipment and some do not even have decent broadband. While online teaching was very demanding and no one wants to go back to it, at least it did not involve engaging with pupils in the classroom while also teaching remotely.

One of the key reasons for going back is to resume productive interaction. Social distancing will make standard classroom strategies like pair work and group work almost impossible. Imagine a migraine-inducing situation where students are merrily yelling at each other from a two-metre distance in the classroom.

Obviously, the 50 per cent who will apparently be at home watching on devices will be very disadvantaged and the pace at which material can be covered will slow to a crawl.

For those in school, what happens at break and lunchtime? Do students stay in a classroom? How do they visit the toilets? Most schools do not have sufficient toilets to allow for queuing in a socially distanced fashion.

I know schools where heating is rationed in the depths of winter because the school cannot afford it. How will they pay for all the additional costs of hand sanitiser, soap, hot water and face masks for staff and so on?

What happens if a teacher or student contracts Covid-19? Teachers and students have underlying conditions, too. Testing and tracing are still not up to speed after months of undelivered promises.

When I wrote recently about my fears for incoming first years, third years and most importantly, sixth years, I was inundated with comments from people annoyed that I had forgotten the particular difficulties facing transition years and second years. Transition year normally involves extensive interaction with the community, for example.

While it is a concession that classroom-based assessments have been modified for third years, much more certainty is needed about what accommodations will be provided for sixth years in terms of adjusted exams and course work.

It already looks like two-metre social distancing is unsustainable for the retail and hospitality industries. I suspect it will be rapidly reduced to one metre and then disappear altogether. (Whether or not that will lead to a second wave of Covid-19 is another day’s work.)

Yet principals and deputies in schools who are already exhausted will spend weeks preparing plans on the basis that social distancing will still exist. Are they supposed to prepare Plan A, Plan B, and Plan C for various contingencies ranging from full social distancing to one metre to none? They will get no break whatsoever. It is poor thanks for all they have given already. They need clear guidance, additional staff and financial assistance. And they need it now."|1
2020-06-13|"“It was a good boost to the morale, because the last few months have been pretty difficult,” Morin said.

While COVID-19 restrictions have shut down many restaurants and bars in downtown Billings, Le Fournil was able to operate as a food producer through the closures. The small entryway into the bakery forced Morin to limit one person in the business at a time. The bread is now wrapped in paper sacks, and a plexiglass barrier separates customers and staff. Morin said delivery and curbside pickup have also been available to customers.

2020-06-13|"Inflation after the pandemic: Theory and practice

The correlation between monetary growth and inflation has an historic pedigree as long as your arm. This column argues that rejecting the likelihood of (eventually) rising velocity following the current massive monetary expansion requires an alternative theory of inflation that has successfully eluded all of us thus far. Ignoring the potential inflationary dangers is the equivalent to an ostrich putting its head in the sand, and while the path towards disinflation may be well known, it simply isn’t available today.

“Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon in the sense that it is and can be produced only by a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output.” Thus, wrote Milton Friedman in 1970 (The Counter-Revolution in Monetary Theory). And for much of the rest of the last century that doctrine was treated as almost self-evident, and taught in most macroeconomic classes at our universities.

Of course, there are many qualifications, to many of which I contributed in my role as a Bank of England economist at the time. Let us take three such:
• First, the money stock is endogenous (even monetary base in a world where central banks use the short-term interest rate as their primary instrument). While inflation requires monetary growth to facilitate and enable it, it may not be the ultimate cause of that pressure. Using monetary measures alone to offset inflationary, or deflationary, pressures may be somewhat of a blunt instrument, and sometimes with undesirable side-effects, whereas focusing on the treatment of the deeper causes, though in concert with complementary monetary measures, could be preferable.
• Second, there are numerous definitions of monetary growth, and they frequently move in divergent ways.
• Third, and related to the second qualification, the velocity of each, or any, of these can change quite dramatically, even over short periods. An obvious example of the latter is the total collapse of the velocity of M0 in the aftermath of its huge expansion, via quantitative easing, following the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), in some large part because a combination of interest on excess reserves (IOER), regulation and a desire for liquidity moved commercial banks into a liquidity trap, where they were prepared to mop up excess reserves almost without limit, thereby disrupting the transmission mechanism to the broader monetary aggregates and the real economy beyond.

We are, of course, currently in a context where the velocity of broad money is dropping just about as fast as its overall supply is being expanded. This arises from a combination of massive involuntary saving (people cannot go on holiday, attend theatres, buy new clothes, etc.), equivalent falls in the incomes of those supplying such services (offset by various forms of fiscal expansion, such as paid furloughs), and precautionary savings. Yes, indeed, but that will not last. Sometime in the foreseeable future, shops, hotels, even theatres, will reopen and the related workers will be rehired. At this point, velocity will revert back towards normality. And what then?

The correlation between monetary growth and inflation has an historic pedigree as long as your arm. Rejecting the likelihood of (eventually) rising velocity following the current massive monetary expansion requires an alternative theory of inflation that has successfully eluded all of us thus far. Ignoring the potential inflationary dangers is the equivalent to an ostrich putting its head in the sand.

But to mix my metaphors, our typical central bank ostrich has another barrel to their gun. Thus, our typical central bank ostrich will say that, even should there be some resurgence in inflation (and it goes beyond a welcome offset to prior undershoots), “we know how to deal with it”. That position strikes me as an a-historical one, perhaps a consequence of economic history in our universities being relegated to a subsidiary status compared, for example, to mathematical mastery of DSGE models.

Even if the path towards disinflation is well known, it simply isn’t available today. The great difficulties that central banks had in raising interest rates sufficiently to conquer inflation in the 1970s are a stark reminder of the difficulties of lowering inflation. Remember Arthur Burns’ (1979) “Anguish of Central Banking”. It took the alignment of three key people – Steve Axilrod, a master monetary tactician/strategist at the Fed; Paul Volcker, a brave and determined Fed chairman; and Ronald Reagan, an understanding, patient and competent president – to bring off that difficult exercise, and what a difficulty it was! Nominal short-term rates went above 20% and real short-term rates were above 5%; there was a short-sharp recession; many less developed countries got into massive difficulties and almost defaulted; and the global systemically important banks were almost all, on a mark-to-market basis, insolvent. And that was at a time when the debt ratios, both in the public and private sectors, were far, far lower than today. Should we see inflation come back, and become expected – if only for a relatively short period of years – at a time when unemployment is likely to remain quite high and the debt ratios have gone through the roof, with over extended and fragile financial markets, is it really sensible to expect that central banks would be politically and socially allowed to raise interest rates on their own account sufficiently to bring inflation back to target? After all, the vaunted independence of the central bank remains in the gift of each national government, except in the case of the ECB where it is protected by a treaty. But even there, should the ECB try to take back the subsequent inflationary surge by sharply raising interest rates, it would be sensible for the Mayor of Frankfurt to invest in equipment to deter riots and demonstrations.

Indeed, in the context of massive government deficits, and debt ratios rising sharply over 100%, (well over the level of Reinhart and Rogoff feared would normally cause serious economic problems), we may need to rethink how to adjust and protect the concept of central bank independence. A few brave economists have begun to think along such lines (e.g. Bianchi 2020, Cukierman 2020). I happen to believe that there are other and better ways to make such adjustments. But that is for another column.

2020-06-13|"“It was a good boost to the morale, because the last few months have been pretty difficult,” Morin said.

While COVID-19 restrictions have shut down many restaurants and bars in downtown Billings, Le Fournil was able to operate as a food producer through the closures. The small entryway into the bakery forced Morin to limit one person in the business at a time. The bread is now wrapped in paper sacks, and a plexiglass barrier separates customers and staff. Morin said delivery and curbside pickup have also been available to customers.

But while the new coronavirus added some stress in business operations, the road construction on First Avenue North has been a bigger issue. Curbside pickup hasn’t been available for the past two months as the City of Billings reconstructs parts of the roadway in the area.

2020-06-13|"China waited more than a week before publishing the genome of the coronavirus in January, an AP investigation claims.

The widow of Li Wenliang, the Chinese doctor who first sounded the alarm about a potential Covid-19 outbreak, has given birth to a son four months after her husband's death.

Doctor Li died aged 33 after contracting the novel coronavirus in February, but first alerted the Chinese authorities to the dangers of the disease back in December 2019.

He was initially ignored by the Chinese government, which played down the threat of the virus after it was first detected in Wuhan. Dr Li was the first person to link the outbreak of the disease to the Huanan seafood market.

Doctor Li's wife, Fu Xuejie, shared an image of her new son on the Chinese social media site WeChat, describing him as a final gift from her late husband.

""Husband, can you see this from heaven? You have given me your final gift today. I will of course love and protect them,"" Mrs Fu told local news outlet Litchi News. Dr Li, an eye doctor, first noticed the virus after reading a report from a colleague which highlighted a patient who was displaying influenza symptoms, but the disease was proving resistant to conventional treatment. Dr Li noted the problem in a further seven patients and sent a note to fellow doctors alerting them that the virus he had found closely resembled SARS. The SARS outbreak in 2003 claimed 774 lives around the world.

Dr Li was told by local Chinese state police to ""stop making false comments"". In a note to fellow doctors on WeChat, Dr Li wrote: ""The latest news is, it has been confirmed that they are coronavirus infections, but the exact virus strain is being subtyped.""

He was a subject of an official investigation along with eight other employees for ""spreading rumours"". Police warned him that unless he stopped he would be prosecuted. He was forced to sign a statement acknowledging his ""misdemeanour"" and promising that he would cease from committing future ""unlawful acts.""

His death in February was greeted with outrage in China. The government was accused of downplaying the severity of the initial outbreak.

Many in China demanded greater freedom of speech following his death, and government censors struggled to delete the avalanche of criticism on sites including WeChat and Weibo.

An internal investigation by Beijing resulted in a formal apology for Dr Li's family and a rare admission of ""shortcomings and deficiencies"" in their response.

Dr Li has since been labelled a ""martyr"" by the Chinese state, which makes any public criticism of him a criminal offence.

His wife said that she could not initially tell her other children that their father had died, preferring instead to say that he had ""gone abroad""."|1
2020-06-13|"ST. LOUIS — The city’s plan to spend federal coronavirus relief cash hit a bump this week after confusion delayed an aldermanic bill to approve Mayor Lyda Krewson’s spending plan.

The hiccup started on Thursday after some amendments, though generally agreed upon, confused an aldermanic committee, leading aldermen to hold up the bill. And that meant it missed a reading in front of the full board on Friday.

Krewson’s chief of staff, Steve Conway, said the delay shouldn’t affect the substance of the $64 million emergency measure.

“It doesn’t slow down anything at all,” Conway said.

The city has already started bidding some of the contracts paid for via the pandemic response money, he said.

The measure — which appropriates $35.3 million in funding from the federal CARES Act and close to $30 million from other federal sources — has drawn little dissent from aldermen. Despite the week’s confusion, aldermen have kept funding where Krewson initially proposed spending it when she released her plan for the emergency funds in late May.

Unlike in St. Louis County, where the council opted to give County Executive Sam Page’s administration unfettered authority over the money, the Krewson administration sent aldermen a plan with over 30 line items for spending the relief money. Among the largest spending categories are $8.1 million for testing kits and personal protective equipment, $5.4 million for rent and mortgage relief and $5 million for affordable housing construction."|1

2020-06-12|"A campaign for a new Royal Yacht to be commissioned to help Britain secure post-Brexit trade deals has growing support from politicians and captains of industry.

There is, however, one crucial flaw: I hear that it does not have the backing of the Queen.

During a conversation with a close friend who had observed that the idea of a new Britannia was gaining momentum, the Monarch’s response was described as ‘lukewarm’.

I’m told: ‘Her Majesty said the last thing she wanted was for the Royal Family to be seen as “angling” for something that detractors could claim was just another royal bauble. She was effectively saying she did not want the hassle.’

And although Prince Philip had been initially keen on the idea of a ‘floating embassy’, he now holds the view that the subject has just become the ‘inevitable political football’.

Reports last weekend said Philip would welcome a go-ahead for a new Britannia as the ‘ideal present’ for his 100th birthday next year, but a royal source tells me: ‘HRH does not believe the concept of a state yacht is feasible at this time.’

John Major’s Government announced in 1994 that it would be decommissioned. Watching it being taken out of service in 1997 was one of the few times the Queen was seen to shed a tear in public. The yacht is now a tourist attraction, berthed in Leith, Edinburgh.

A new yacht, which would cost at least £100 million, was backed by Boris Johnson when Foreign Secretary. He said it would ‘add greatly to the soft power of this country’.

Car parks tycoon Sir Donald Gosling, who was close to the Queen, had pledged £50 million. But shortly before his death last year he said: ‘It would have to be paid for by industry. It could only be deemed a “Royal Yacht” if it had the support of the Queen and the Navy.’

In the acclaimed recent film version of Little Women, Florence Pugh’s character, Amy March, became the model of refined elegance. But in real life, the actress is fed up with her generation’s poor table manners.

‘I know how to go to a dinner and be my most polite self,’ declares the daughter of Oxford restaurateur Clinton Pugh. [But] ‘when you go for a dinner with strangers and someone is not listening to you whatsoever, and talking at the top of their voice, that really bothers me.’

Dinner-party bores are not the only bugbear for Florence, 24, (left) who’s courting Zach Braff, an American actor 20 years her senior.

‘Also, chewing with your mouth open is not good,’ she says. ‘It’s so easy just to close it.’

Earl Spencer has generously allowed his private chef to use the kitchens at his Northamptonshire stately home, Althorp, to spend the past six weeks preparing more than 11,000 meals for NHS staff.

‘Cooking for the people working day in, day out to fight Covid-19 was an incredible experience,’ says chef Danny Tompkins.

‘It was one of the biggest challenges I’ve ever undertaken, but definitely the most rewarding.’ Lord Spencer, brother of Princess Diana, says it’s ‘the least we could do’.

Of all the hospital exits by Covid survivors, none can have been so dramatic as that of Oscar-winning songwriter Don Black.

He’s revealed that nurses lined up to sing one of his most famous tunes as he was pushed out of Chelsea & Westminster Hospital in a wheelchair.

‘The door opened and about 30 nurses clapped me and sang Born Free,’ the lyricist tells me. ‘It was an incredible goosebump moment I’ll obviously never forget. I wasn’t expecting applause, let alone the song.’

Black, 81, whose classics include the James Bond themes Diamonds Are Forever, fought a ‘touch-and-go’ battle against the disease for nine days.

‘I owe them my life,’ he says of the NHS staff. ‘They took all the terror out of it. A nurse would come and squeeze my hand and say: “You’re doing very well.” When I went to bed, a nurse would stroke my hair and say: “Sweet dreams.”

Chat show host Alan Carr, who is 44 on Monday, is not sure middle age suits him.

‘When you’re not the best-looking person in the world, you hope you’ll age like a fine wine,’ he says.

‘That hasn’t happened — I’m like that last bag of peppers that’s been left on the shelf after some stockpiling.’"|1
2020-06-12|"(Reuters) - The top U.S. infectious disease official on Friday cautioned that the “blips” of rising coronavirus hospitalizations being reported by some states could get out of control if robust contact tracing regimes are not put in place.

As restrictions on economic activity are lifted, the United States was bound to see increased infections, Anthony Fauci told CNN.

“But when you start seeing more hospitalizations, that’s a sure fire sign that you’re in a situation where you’re going in the wrong direction,” Fauci said.

So far, more than 114,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the United States, according to a Reuters tally. About half a dozen U.S. states are grappling with a rising number of coronavirus patients filling hospital beds.

Texas and North Carolina on Friday reported their highest hospitalization rates since the pandemic began. But officials in both states point out they also have among the lowest rates of deaths from COVID-19.

Fauci underscored that increased hospitalizations was a worrying trend, however, and a sign that “maybe we need to slow down a little” on reopenings.

North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said on Friday that while his state’s rise in hospitalizations and new cases was sobering, moving ahead with more reopenings was not off the table.

Texas has been at the forefront of states’ efforts to reopen their economies and Governor Greg Abbott on Friday said in an interview with KYTX TV it would remain that way “because we have so many hospital beds available to anybody who gets ill.”

“For every person in a hospital bed, there are 10 open, available hospital beds available for them,” Abbott said. “So there’s plenty of hospital capacity to be able to deal with COVID-19.”

He added that there is “no real need to ratchet back the opening of businesses in the state.”

A handful of states and cities have paused or slowed reopenings.

Oregon Governor Kate Brown said she would put county applications to reopen on hold after the state reported a record daily rise in new coronavirus cases on Thursday.

“This is essentially a statewide ‘yellow light,’ it’s time to press pause for one week before any further reopening,” Brown, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Utah’s Republican Governor Gary Herbert on Friday ordered most of the state to halt reopening while it investigated a jump in cases.

“I don’t want to go forward and then take a step backward,” Herbert said of the order that remains in effect until June 26."|1
2020-06-12|"The voices are ringing out across the sporting landscape. From Austin to Iowa City, from Clemson to Columbus, the cries for change are pleading to be heard.

College athletes are demanding equality and creating kinetic and dynamic change. In the wake of George Floyd’s homicide by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, the sports world has been indelibly altered in just a few short weeks. And the most promising part is that this feels like the beginning.

Should we start at Clemson? President Jim Clements announced on Friday morning that the board of trustees passed a ruling to rename an honors college and requested a building on campus be renamed because both namesakes had direct links to slavery. This came just days after former Clemson stars Deshaun Watson and DeAndre Hopkins petitioned on social media for changes.

Should we look at Texas? A group of football players and other athletes announced via social media that they want the school to rename buildings on campus and change the school song played at athletic events because of ties to racism.

The Texas athletes also want to add a black athletic history exhibit to the school’s hall of fame. The players threatened to not take part in recruiting visits for incoming players and other alumni events until the changes are made.

“We aim to hold the athletic department and university to a higher standard by not only asking them to keep their promise of condemning racism on our campus, but to go beyond this by taking action to make Texas more comfortable and inclusive for the black athletes and the black community,” said the Texas athletes in a statement.

Should we go to Iowa City? Coach Kirk Ferentz held a news conference with three players on Friday to speak about the “raw” conversations within the program in the wake of a wave of accusations that strength coach Chris Doyle fostered an environment where black players felt degraded. (Doyle is suspended pending an investigation.)

The changes, stands and shifts are happening in myriad ways. The NCAA, an organization that operates glacially, announced that they are “encouraging all member schools” to assist students in registering to vote in the upcoming election and designate Nov. 3 as a day off to accommodate that. (Last year, college basketball held one of its marquee events, the Champions Classic, on Election Day.)

College sports isn’t alone. The changes are rippling through other sports. The Confederate flag has been banned in NASCAR. NBA players are rallying together to make sure they are treated fairly when they are quarantined in the bubble for the conclusion of their season. A coup in the NFL offices led to Michael Thomas, Patrick Mahomes and a slew of other top stars guilting the NFL and commissioner Roger Goodell into saying that Black Lives Matter.

It’d be naïve to celebrate this evolution as a revolution, as there’d been too many decades of systemic racism in our country to get too excited about a few weeks percolating with promising changes. (After all, President Trump is still using Colin Kaepernick’s kneeling to protest police brutality as a cultural prop to rally his base.) But it’d also be naïve to ignore the significance of the baby steps toward change, and root hard for them to become bigger and more pronounced.

This is especially true in the college athletics community as the unpaid stars have found their voice, channeled their power and begun steps to make sure that they’re heard.

“You’re seeing a lot more student-athletes speaking up, and it’s great,” Clements told Yahoo Sports in a phone interview Friday afternoon. “I’m really proud of my guys who are taking a stand and using the platform.”

That includes star quarterback Trevor Lawrence, who has begun forging a compelling identity the past few months. He’s raised thousands for charity in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and spoke vocally and eloquently about racial injustice in the wake of Floyd’s killing.

“I’m siding with my brothers that deal, and continuously deal, with things I will never experience,” Lawrence said on Twitter. “The injustice is clear… and so it the hate. It can no longer be explained away. If you’re still ‘explaining’ it – check your heart and ask why.”

Lawrence has comported himself better than his own head coach, Dabo Swinney, who so far has failed to fully exploit his platform to affect change by talking in circles. Lawrence and three teammates — Mike Jones, Darien Rencher and Cornell Powell — are leading a peaceful protest this weekend designed to bring the community together in the Clemson area.

There have almost been too many important moments to rattle off without this story becoming a list. Athletes with ties to a bevy of schools — Utah, Clemson and Iowa, to name a few — have detailed racial incidents with coaches on social media. Then there was Marvin Wilson, the star Florida State defensive tackle, calling out coach Mike Norvell for airbrushing the truth about reaching out to all his FSU players in the wake of Floyd’s death. There’s former Harvard star Seth Towns, who transferred to Ohio State, speaking out after getting detained at a peaceful protest in Columbus.

“I was standing up for what I believe in,” Towns told Yahoo’s Jeff Eisenberg. “I wasn’t stopping whether I was being detained, arrested or beaten.”

Longtime observers can’t recall a similar moment to what we’re in right now.

“I think this going to change athletics,” former college basketball coach and ESPN analyst Fran Fraschilla said on Friday. “We’re in an amazing period of time. It’s obviously historic.”

Amid the dizzying flood of news on Friday was the reminder from Florida, which signed a name, image and likeness bill into law, that suggests just how different college sports will look in nearly a year.

What started as a flurry of statements from coaches two weeks ago in the wake of Floyd’s death has been followed up by much more significant actions by athletes around college sports. The paradigm shifts are just beginning.

Here’s hoping that we remember this time as the start of something much bigger.

 Sunday, Channel 4, 9pm

 This documentary focuses on the events of 1953, when Queen Elizabeth, just a year into her reign, was deployed in a US plot to topple Iran’s democratic leader in favour of an all-powerful shah. Planned by MI6 and carried out by the CIA, it would have a huge impact on relations between Iran and the West, which continue to be problematic. However, as the documentary discovers, even the queen herself didn’t know the truth about her role. Drawing on newly declassified secret documents, this programme reveals what really happened for the first time.

Two years ago, Russian nationals Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were targets of a bizarre assassination attempt, using the highly toxic drug Novichok. When the pair were found unconscious on a park bench in the English town of Salisbury, police were baffled, and this three-part drama re-enacts the series of events as authorities, realising with horror what has happened, move to lock down the town to prevent the deadly toxin infecting more people. Rafe Spall stars as DS Nick Bailey, who becomes ill soon after he visits the Skripals’ home in search of clues. Anne-Marie Duff plsyd Tracy Daszkiewicz, the public health director who must move fast to save the people of Salisbury from becoming infected.

Macbeth: Royal Shakespeare Company

 Sunday, BBC4, 9.30pm

 This 2018 contemporary production of Shakespeare’s darkest psychological thriller, directed by Polly Findlay, marked both Christopher Eccleston’s RSC debut in the title role, and the return of Niamh Cusack to the company as Lady Macbeth. Returning home from battle, the victorious Macbeth meets three witches on the heath. Driven by their disturbing prophecies, the rugged soldier sets out on the path to murder. The supporting cast is on fine form, with three standout performers: Edward Bennett as a moving Macduff, Luke Newberry as Malcolm and, perhaps most impressive of all, Raphael Sowole as a thoughtful Banquo.

Come Dine with Me

 Monday, Channel 4, 5.30pm

 It might not do much for those lockdown diets, but this ever engaging series is always a tasty confection, especially if you fancy a break from the endlessly bleak news. Now the cooking contest is back for a new run, and in Hertfordshire, bargain-seeker Heidi (33) serves up a bold Asian menu. The cost-conscious host cooks a cheap meat alternative for her starter. But will it – and a game that mimics her shopping habits – satisfy her guests? Bon appetit!

Murder in the Car Park

 Monday, Channel 4, 9pm

 In March 1987, the body of private investigator Daniel Morgan was found in the car park of a south London pub with £1,000 in his pocket and an axe buried in his head. More than 30 years on, who killed him remains a mystery. Channel 4 tries to outdo Netflix with this true crime documentary series, which delves into Morgan’s murder. The case has been linked to the News of the World investigative journalism scandal as well as London’s criminal underworld, police corruption and even the British establishment. For the first time, those once suspected of killing Morgan, the investigating officers and his grieving brother tell their side of this disturbing story.

From labyrinthine bazaars to Persepolis – the seat of Persia’s ancient kings – to a temple where a holy fire has burned for 1,000 years, broadcaster and journalist Samira Ahmed goes on a remarkable journey to places rarely seen. The Persians once ruled a vast empire from Egypt to northern India, but their culture was very nearly lost. While the history of their ancient kings was almost forgotten, waves of conquering dynasties brought a new language and a new religion. But despite subjugation, blood and revolution, Persia’s culture flourished. Iranians’ sense of identity helped them weather the storms of conquest, and their art and language became weapons of resistance and defiance.

Making a Museum: The Story of MoLI

 Tuesday, RTÉ One, 7pm

Holy MoLI! Can it be a year since the Museum of Literature Ireland opened its doors on Dublin’s Stephen’s Green, providing a splendid Georgian space where people could celebrate Ireland’s great writers? MoLI houses hundreds of years of great Irish literature, including the first-ever copy of Ulysses. To celebrate Bloomsday (for it is today), RTÉ is screening this half-hour documentary by Luke McManus, who followed the MoLI from the beginning, rolling the cameras while this unique project was being rolled out. McManus has worked the camera for Dermot Bannon’s Room to Improve, and it soon becomes apparent that this is one renovation job for the books.

Tutankhamun in Colour

 Tuesday, BBC 4, 9pm

 Oxford University Egyptologist Elizabeth Frood is our guide to the discovery of the tomb in 1922 by Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon. It provided much-needed good news, following the Great War and the Spanish flu pandemic of 1919 and we’ve been transfixed ever since. From bringing to life the young Carter from an old family photo, documenting Egypt’s transformation during the Great War, to the great operation excavating the tomb and the grand revealing of Tutankhamun itself – colourisation brings a new element of realism to this great moment in history.

24 Hours in A&E

 Tuesday, Channel 4, 9pm

 The hospital documentary returns, focusing on the stories of two motorcyclists, which reveal how the bonds between loved ones can be strengthened through adversity. Prezmek may have life-changing spinal injuries following a high-speed motorcycle crash on the M4, forcing his wife Tatia to reflect on how their plans for the future may have to change. Teenager Leon undergoes a CT scan after crashing. While waiting for the results, his mother Janey thinks back to his school days.

There’s a new party drug in town. It’s called Blis, and all the cool kids in Berlin are getting off on it. The drug is sweeping the German capital’s club scene, but there’s a nasty side-effect: anyone who ingests it has their body taken over by aliens from outer space. Bummer. The adventure begins when Berlin woman Nora isn’t feeling quite herself after a wild night out. Meanwhile, investigators Nique Navar and David Leonhart are investigating why teenagers are suddenly vanishing – is this another side-effect of Blis? Sounds like good, clean bodysnatching fun.

Hawks & Doves: The Crown and Ireland’s War of Independence

 Wednesday, RTÉ One, 9.35pm

You may be surprised that Diarmaid Ferriter is not presenting this new two-part documentary on a seminal event in Irish history. You may be even more surprised that the presenter is none other than former Tory MP and British defence secretary Michael Portillo. But Portillo brings a unique insight into this time of turmoil, exploring how his predecessors at Westminster reacted to seismic events across the Irish Sea. Turns out that many English politicians at the time were less concerned with the Irish question and more interested in furthering their own political careers. Portillo gets into the mindset of Britain’s parliament of the day, and how the Conservatives used the War of Independence as a weapon to empower their own party. Unsurprisingly, it doesn’t seem a million miles away from all the intrique and chicanery that went on in the House of Commons during Brexit.

If you thought Earth needed millions of years to change, it’s time to think again: this film uses the latest science to reveal how much our planet can change in just one single day. Fact: Earth makes a mountain of new rock every hour and is not only constantly changing shape but is also losing weight. In fact, every day you wake up on a completely different planet.The documentary starts on the island of Stromboli, where geologist Chris Jackson climbs a volcano to see how much lava a single volcano can produce on a daily basis and how it builds new land. In Iceland we find out how the entire country is growing as the inner Earth forces the continents apart and creates new land in between. (The moving of continents causes around 300,000 earthquakes each day.)

Keeping Britain Fed

 Wednesday, BBC2, 8pm

 Cast your mind back to February and March. People were going about their daily lives, and perhaps stopping off at the corner shop or supermarket to pick up our groceries on their way home. Suddenly that all changed, and during the lockdown, our perception of those who keep us fed shifted dramatically. For this one-off documentary, Sara Cox and Ade Adepitan are given access to some of Britain’s biggest food retailers and their suppliers to see how their systems stood up to the most testing time in their history. Cox finds out what goes on in one supermarket, while Adepitan witnesses how the UK’s farms, factories and depots rose to the challenge of producing and suppling food in the exceptional circumstances.

Architect George Clarke delves into the world of small builds, meeting people taking tiny, unpromising spaces and creating places to live, work and play. In the first episode, Clarke talkes to a couple who are creating a disappearing bathroom and a man squeezing a camper into a Reliant Robin. He also discovers Chile’s stunning architecture, and plans his hardest-ever build: an observatory. The full series will be available on All4 after this episode is broadcast.

O’Casey in the Estate

 Theatre has a grand tradition of posh people pretending to be ordinary folk – they win Tony awards for it. But imagine if the plain people of Ireland got to be in the plays of O’Casey while the luvvies had to wait in the wings. In this two-part documentary, the people of Dublin’s East Wall prepare to stage a production of The Plough and the Stars, which depicted life that area 100 years ago. What’s changed in the community in the past century? Well, they may no longer be living in tenements, but the people of East Wall still feel they don’t have a voice in modern Ireland. So what better platform than the Abbey stage? Director Caitriona "|2

2020-06-14|"IT WAS BY digital video shared in May that global attention first turned to the killing of George Floyd. In a striking parallel, it was again by video that Derek Chauvin, the white police officer filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, made his first appearance in court as a murder suspect. Handcuffed and in an orange jumpsuit, with a protective mask over his mouth, the 44-year-old cop was beamed into Hennepin County court in Minneapolis on June 8th for around 15 minutes from a maximum-security prison. From there, through the lens of a digital video camera, Mr Chauvin looked on as a judge told him his bail would be set for at least $1m.

The coronavirus pandemic has forced courts around the globe to modernise with unprecedented haste. America’s covid-19 stimulus package includes a provision for federal judges to use teleconferencing. Its Supreme Court conducted hearings by telephone for the first time. India’s Supreme Court began hearing all cases on an app called Vidyo on March 23rd. Spain held its first internet trial in May. Britain’s Supreme Court changed its rules to require all evidence to be submitted digitally. A branch of government built on precedent is now procedurally breaking it. The speed with which it is doing so means the effects are hard to predict but certain to reshape the judicial system, even after covid-19 has subsided.

Legal reformers have long advocated digitisation. Technology can make justice cheaper and more accessible, streamlining systems already stretched to their limits. Hearings in digital conference rooms can be easier to attend than physical ones for reporters covering the courts. Remote proceedings also prevent the spread of disease. The best way to get people into otherwise packed courtrooms without the risk of contagion is by video link. Although speaking on services such as Zoom feels awkward, some research has shown that digital platforms have little effect on verdicts. Defendants in a simulated criminal trial who testified on camera in a recent Australian study were no more likely to be found guilty than those who appeared beside their lawyers in court.

But such technology is untested at scale. Research so far on its impact has been inconclusive. Slow internet speeds, bad hardware and confusing software can negate the time and expense supposedly saved. Human-rights advocates argue that delivering harsh sentences remotely is “inhumane”—if society is going to condemn someone to death, it should have the courage to do it face to face. Indeed, in May a man in Singapore received his death sentence (for drug smuggling) by Zoom.

Further, digital justice threatens to upend the ancient understanding that courts should be open to the public. Spectators remind courts that their decisions have bearing on society. Video access could make courtrooms more accessible by extending the number of people who might attend from a few dozen to thousands or more. But as internet users have discovered over the past decade, the web is easy to wall off. Courts could block access with passwords and private Zoom sessions, or leave proceedings open but difficult to join, on hard-to-find web pages. So video justice needs rules ensuring some public scrutiny.

For legal systems, the pandemic has amounted to an unexpected, months-long experiment into digital procedure. Richard Susskind, author of “Online Courts and the Future of Justice"", said at a recent British parliamentary committee meeting that the adoption of remote hearings around the world has for the first time produced a significant amount of data for researchers. Both civil-law and common-law countries appear to be adopting remote courts at similar rates, he says. Countries with a greater openness to alternative dispute-resolution processes, such as mediation or conciliation, may be more open to new technologies.

Initial findings suggest a divergence between the branches of the justice system. Civil cases—those without juries—appear to transfer easily to cyberspace. On June 5th Britain’s Civil Justice Council published a report that surveyed more than 1,000 lawyers, journalists and members of the public who had taken part in remote civil cases since mid-March. Some 71.5% of respondents said they had had a positive or very positive experience with remote hearings.

Yet anecdotal evidence suggests that participants in family courts have been less positive. In Britain judges have spoken out about the difficulty of handling delicate matters such as child custody remotely. Family-court justices often speak directly with lay participants at the end of trials to explain their decisions. The internet curtails opportunities to offer empathy outside a hearing’s regular formalities. In criminal courts, meanwhile, the need for juries has posed big challenges. It would be difficult to ensure the impartiality of jurors logging in from their kitchen tables, where they could be influenced by outsiders.

As countries relax social-distancing restrictions, courts may face new and potentially even more difficult questions. Young demonstrators newly alive to the inequities of the justice system—its great costs, its slowness, its procedural complexities and robed formalities often alien to those of humbler backgrounds—may bring greater scrutiny to courts. Many have amassed backlogs of cases put on pause during the pandemic. To cope, authorities may have to keep more of the emergency digital measures than they might have imagined.

2020-06-14|"What will be the political legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic? This column uses data from the 2006-2018 Gallup World Polls to show that epidemic exposure during an individual’s ‘impressionable years’ of 18 to 25 has a persistent negative effect on trust in political institutions and leaders, especially in democracies. Combined with other evidence that trust is important for limiting the spread of infection, this raises the spectre of a circular, self-reinforcing spiral in which poor public health policy leads to deeper distrust, further undermining the effectiveness of public health policy.

It is widely argued (e.g. Fukyuama 2020) that the keys to success in dealing with COVID-19 are “whether citizens trust their leaders, and whether those leaders preside over a competent and effective state.” By way of example, Rothstein (2020) ascribes the greater success at containing the COVID-19 in the Nordic countries than in Italy in part to greater trust in government.

Trust in government is not a given, however (Dustmann et al. 2017, Grosjean 2019). Specifically, there is reason to ask whether COVID-19 itself will affect trust in political institutions and leaders.

In a new paper, we provide the first evidence on the effects of epidemics on political trust (Aksoy et al. 2020). We use individual-level data on confidence in political institutions and leaders from the 2006-2018 Gallup World Polls (GWP), fielded in nearly 140 countries annually. Our data cover some 750,000 respondents from 142 countries. We analyse responses to questions about confidence in the government, confidence in elections, and approval of national leaders. We link these individual responses to the incidence of epidemics since 1970 as tabulated in the EM-DAT International Disasters Database (see Figure 1). By incorporating a wide range of fixed effects, controlling various observable characteristics as well as past exposure to other economic and political shocks, we can address potential concerns with omitted variables.

Figure 1 Average number of people (per million) affected by epidemics, 1970-2017

Notes: This figure shows the number of people affected by epidemics (per million), averaged across all available years. 

Source: EM-DAT International Disaster Database, 1970-2017, UN Population Database, 1970-2017, and authors’ calculations.

Building on previous work suggesting that attitudes and behaviour are durably moulded in what psychologists and sociologists refer to as the ‘impressionable’ late-adolescent and early-adult years, we show that exposure to epidemics at this stage in the life course durably shapes confidence in political institutions and attitudes toward political leaders. (On the ‘impressionable years’, hypothesis, see Dawson and Prewitt 1969 and Krosnick and Alwin 1989; for an economic application, see Guiliano and Spilimbergo 2014.)

Specifically, we find that individuals who experience epidemics in their impressionable years (specifically, ages 18 to 25) display less confidence in political leaders, governments, and elections. The effects are substantial: an individual with the highest exposure to an epidemic (relative to zero exposure) is 7.2 percentage points less likely to have confidence in the honesty of elections; 5.1 percentage points less likely to have confidence in the national government; and 6.2 percentage points less likely to approve the performance of the political leader. (The respective averages of these three variables in our sample are 51%, 50%, and 50%.) These effects represent the average treatment values for the remainder of life. They decay only gradually and persist for two decades: the difference between the median age during impressionable years (21.5) and the median age in the last subsample (40.5) corresponds to 19 years (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Effects of epidemics in impressionable years over subsamples with rolling age-windows

Note: This figure shows the persistence of the effects on three main outcome variables by restricting the observations to the respondents who are in the 26-35 age range at the time of the survey (Base sample) and then repeatedly rolling this age window forward by one year for each separate estimation. The plotted coefficient is Exposure to epidemic (18-25) in Equation (1) in Aksoy et al. (2000). Confidence intervals are at 95% significance level. 

Source: Gallup World Polls, 2006-2018 and EM-DAT International Disaster Database, 1970-2017.

There is significant heterogeneity in these effects. Less-educated individuals respond more strongly, adopting even more negative attitudes towards political institutions and leaders. Residents of urban areas respond more negatively than those residing in rural areas. Women display larger drops in confidence. The negative impact of epidemic exposure is larger in middle- and high-income countries.

We then explore amplification and transmission mechanisms. We show that the effects we identify are specific to communicable diseases, such as viruses, which can spread contagiously and where a timely and effective public policy response is critical for containment. For non-communicable diseases, in contrast, we do not see the same impact of past impressionable-year outbreaks on subsequent views of the trustworthiness of governments and leaders.

In addition, individuals exposed to epidemics in their impressionable years are less likely to have confidence in the public health system and the safety and efficacy of vaccination. The former is indicative of trust in the overall health policies of the government, while the latter can be taken as reflecting attitudes specifically toward pharmaceutical interventions. These findings suggest that the perceived (in)adequacy of health-related government interventions during epidemics, both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical, are important for trust in government more generally.

In addition, the magnitude of the effect we identify depends on the strength of the government at the time of the epidemic. When individuals experience epidemics under weak governments, the negative impact on trust is larger and more persistent. This is consistent with the idea that such governments are less capable of effectively responding to epidemics, hence leading to a long-term fall in political trust.

We substantiate this conjecture by considering this same conditioning factor, government strength, in the context of COVID-19. We show that government strength is associated with statistically significant improvements in policy response time (the number of days between the date of first confirmed case and the date of the first non-pharmaceutical intervention). This supports the notion that government strength at the time of the epidemic is a predictor of effective policy responses and that its absence amplifies the negative revision of political trust in response to epidemics.

Finally, we show that our results are driven by the reaction to epidemic exposure in democracies. In democracies, residents sharply and persistently revise (downward) their political trust in the event of impressionable-year epidemic exposure. The same is not true in autocracies. Evidently, citizens expect democratic governments to be responsive to their health concerns, and where the public-sector response is not sufficient to head off the epidemic, they revise their views in unfavourable ways. In autocracies, in contrast, there may not exist a comparable expectation of responsiveness and hence no impact on political trust. In addition, democratic regimes may find consistent messaging more difficult. Because such regimes are open, they may allow for a cacophony of conflicting official views, resulting in a larger impact on trust when things go wrong.

Trust and confidence in government are important for the capacity of a society to organise an effective collective response to an epidemic. Yet there is also the possibility that experiencing an epidemic can negatively affect an individual’s confidence in political institutions and trust in political leaders, with negative implications for this collective capacity. We have shown that this negative effect is large and persistent. Its largest and most enduring impact is on the attitudes of individuals who are in their impressionable late-adolescent and early-adult years when an epidemic breaks out.

In addition, epidemic exposure in one’s impressionable years matters mainly for residents of democratic countries. Residents in democracies sharply revise downward their confidence and trust in political institutions and leaders following significant exposure, whereas the same is not true in autocracies. It may be that citizens expect democratic governments to be responsive to their concerns and that where the public-sector response is not adequate, they revise their attitudes unfavourably. In autocracies, there may not exist a comparable expectation of responsiveness. In addition, democratic regimes may find consistent messaging more difficult. Because such regimes are open, they may allow for a cacophony of conflicting official views, resulting in a larger impact on confidence and trust.

The implications are disturbing. Imagine that more trust in government is important for effective containment, but that failure of containment harms trust in government.1 One can envisage a scenario where low levels of trust allow an epidemic to spread, and where the spread of the epidemic reduces trust in government still further, hindering the ability of the authorities to contain future epidemics and address other social problems. As Schmitt (2020) puts it, “lack of trust in government can be a circular, self-reinforcing phenomenon: Poor performance leads to deeper distrust, in turn leaving government in the hands of those with the least respect for it.”

2020-06-14|"Those common, vibrating “thwip” helicopter sounds arrived well before they showed up, as 413th Flight Test Squadron personnel turned to look to the north at Eglin Air Force Base, May 19.

Seconds later, two helicopters appeared and the sounds and vibrations intensified. The Air Force’s newest combat search and rescue helicopter, the HH-60W Jolly Green II, led the way down the Duke Field runway. It was followed by the Army’s multi-role combat helicopter, the AH-64 Apache.

The two aircraft landed at Eglin AFB completing their first flight and combined test mission together.

The Apache, from Redstone Army Test Center, Alabama, flew in for system testing with the HH-60W.

“The unique configuration of the AH-64 Apache gave our team the opportunity to test capabilities of the HH-60W in ways normally not possible here,” said Christopher Martin, 413th FLTS HH-60W lead test engineer “Tests like these will ensure the Jolly Green II will be able to perform its critical combat search and rescue mission when fielded in the joint warfighting environment.”

The joint service test-effort marks another milestone in Jolly Green II’s development. This year, the new helicopter has completed extreme environment, communications and defense system testing just to name a few.

The 413th FLTS leads the HH-60W integrated test team along with members of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, 88th Test and Evaluation Squadron, Detachment 2, and Air Force Operational Test Center.

“We are very proud of the work our integrated test team accomplished in 2020 despite a myriad of operational restrictions due to COVID-19,” said Shawn Hammond, HH-60W test program manager. “The team’s success is due to a mission-focused mindset to ensure the crews flying the Jolly Green II into combat have the most reliable and capable helicopter for the job.”

2020-06-14|"The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns about the future of work. The pandemic may become recurrent and necessitate repeated adoptions of social distancing measures, creating substantial uncertainty about worker productivity. This column presents a theoretical framework suggesting that such job uncertainty reduces aggregate demand, and dampens business investment in general. However, automation may provide one way for businesses to cope with the uncertainty about worker productivity. It appears that pandemic-induced job uncertainty could stimulate automation investment, despite declines in aggregate demand.

The Covid-19 outbreak is leading to a steep decline in global economic activity as countries around the world use social distancing measures to avoid exposure to the coronavirus or to limit its spread. The pandemic has also led to a surge in uncertainty. The ‘VIX’ – a frequently used measure of uncertainty – spiked to levels surpassing even those experienced during the 2007-2008 global crisis (see Figure 1). While the VIX has declined since its March peak, its level remains elevated by historical standards, suggesting that households and businesses are still facing a highly uncertain environment.

An important source of this uncertainty stems from the unknown evolution of the virus and the effectiveness of social distancing measures. Absent the discovery of an effective vaccine with widespread availability, additional waves of infections remain a possibility. Thus, social distancing measures and lockdowns may need to be periodically reintroduced to deal with future infection flare-ups, which may portend a ‘new normal’ in which viral infections become more pervasive and forceful. Such an uncertain environment is highly challenging for businesses that need employees to be on site, since workers may be exposed to potential health risks or have to stay home due to lockdowns. Thus, businesses may need to consider alternative strategies to minimise the impact of future production disruptions.

For some businesses, automation may be an attractive option (e.g. Kilic and Marin 2020). By reducing the need for on-site human interactions, investing in robots, for instance, could help address concerns about future viral outbreaks (and the associated production disruptions). On the other hand, businesses typically refrain from investing in the face of heightened uncertainty, preferring to wait for more clarity (e.g. Bloom 2009, Leduc and Liu 2016). As a result, while automation may provide one way to cope with the production uncertainty induced by the pandemic, it also necessitates investment spending that firms may be reluctant to actually make. Given the rarity of serious viral outbreaks in much of the world in recent decades, empirical results describing how firms adapt to such situations are limited. Ma et al. (2020) provide evidence for the impact of epidemics in Asia over the past 20 years, but their analysis does not apply to the rest of the world. In this context, estimated theoretical models can provide a useful alternative, complementing some of the emerging work on uncertainty and the pandemic. For some recent empirical studies on pandemic-induced uncertainty, see Baker et al. (2020), Leduc and Liu (2020a) and Dietrich et al. (2020). Further, the new eBook by Baldwin and di Mauro (2020) contains additional essays on a wide range of topics related to COVID-19 economics.

In a recent paper (Leduc and Liu 2020b), we develop a quantitative New Keynesian model of the labour market. In this model, firms face uncertainty about future labour productivity and have the ability to automate jobs. We focus on one channel of pandemic-induced uncertainty that we label job uncertainty, emphasising the impact that future outbreaks may have on worker productivity. For simplicity, we assume that productivity is impacted by labour-specific productivity shocks that are subject to ‘second-moment’ disturbances, capturing variations in uncertainty.

We build on our earlier work (Leduc and Liu 2019) and study the role of automation in an economy with ‘search and matching frictions’ in the labour market. Firms create, and post, job vacancies to hire workers and produce goods. Firms that are unsuccessful in finding a worker can decide to automate the job with a robot. Robots can perfectly substitute for workers, therefore differing from physical capital in standard macro models. In this sense, automation is a form of labour-saving technology.

Adopting a robot entails a fixed cost, and using a robot also incurs an operating cost. A firm’s decision to adopt a robot depends on the relative benefit of automating versus keeping a vacancy open. If a firm decides to keep a vacancy open, it can decide to fill it with a worker or a robot in the future. Importantly, in contrast to workers, robots and their productivity would not be susceptible to epidemics, since viruses do not impede their ability to produce. Hence, whether to automate or not will partly depend on current, and expected, future worker productivity, and pandemic-induced job uncertainty would be an important factor underlying automation decisions.

To assess the quantitative effects of job uncertainty, we first estimate our model to fit quarterly US time series data from 1985:Q1 to 2018:Q4. In addition to the unemployment and vacancy rates, we fit the model to the time series of real wages, labour productivity, inflation, and nominal interest rates. Since the rate of automation has important implications for productivity and wage growth, including these variables helps discipline the importance of automation. In our estimation, we do not consider pandemic-induced uncertainty, since pandemics are not observed in our sample. After we estimate the model, we introduce uncertainty shocks to worker productivity to examine its macroeconomic effects.

We show that an increase in pandemic-induced job uncertainty operates through two channels: a demand-reducing channel and a technology-switching channel. First, the job uncertainty raises precautionary saving and reduces household consumption. Since prices are sticky, firms cut production to meet the reduced demand for their products. All else being equal, the decline in economic activity reduces a firm’s incentive to invest in automation. However, through the technology-switching channel, the job uncertainty would incentivise a firm to automate, since robots are not susceptible to viruses and can continue to operate during epidemics.

Figure 2 shows that a pandemic-induced uncertainty shock raises the unemployment rate whilst also boosts automation in the benchmark model (the blue solid lines). These impulse responses reflect that the technology-switching channel dominates the demand-reducing channel under our estimation.

In general, increased automation can have ambiguous impacts on employment. Since robots substitute for workers, increased automation tends to reduce employment. However, given the option of automation, a firm would have a stronger incentive to create new job vacancies because of the reduced risks associated with hiring workers. Under our estimated parameters, this latter channel boosts employment and outweighs the labour-substituting effects of automation.

To illustrate the interactions between automation and unemployment in our model, we consider a counterfactual model in which automation is kept constant at its steady-state value. Figure 2 shows that, with no fluctuations in automation, a pandemic-induced job uncertainty shock would have led to a deeper recession with a sharper increase in unemployment (the red dashed line). Therefore, endogenous automation decisions help alleviate the recessionary impact of the job uncertainty shock. An alternative way to interpret our results is that automation reduces some tasks done by workers, whereas it facilitates other tasks, which boosts overall employment (e.g. Acemoglu and Restrepo 2019).

Figure 2 Impulse responses to job uncertainty shock in the estimated model

In our model, the effects of an increase in job uncertainty differ markedly from a realised decline in labour productivity such as that occurring in the current pandemic. Since social distancing measures and health concerns during a pandemic can hinder a worker’s ability to work, the fall in labour productivity primarily acts as a negative supply shock that reduces potential output and increases inflation. As a result, firms automate less. In contrast, pandemic-induced job uncertainty leads to a recession by reducing aggregate demand, such that both output and inflation decline. Despite the decline in demand, firms still increase automation investment because of the positive technology-switching channel.

Overall, our finding suggests that pandemic-induced job uncertainty shocks can have a positive net effect on automation investment, despite its negative effects on aggregate demand. Although robots can substitute for workers, the increased automation (stemming from the technology-switching channel) can still mitigate job losses. The option of automating reduces the risk of hiring workers and thus boosts a firm’s incentive for creating new positions.

2020-06-14|"Eight hundred and ten students graduated from the Oregon Institute of Technology on Saturday through a virtual ceremony with pre-recorded messages from university President Dr. Nagi Naganathan, U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley, Oregon Health and Sciences University President Dr. Danny Jacobs and other student and university leaders.

“Graduates, as the class of 2020, an imperative has fallen on you that you did not ask for and did not expect. Our world changed so dramatically and so quickly, almost overnight, in ways that have affected just about everyone, not just in our neighborhoods or our states or even our country, but globally,” said Naganathan in his virtual address to students. “While you likely have some strong feelings about having to miss the important rite of passage of an in-person commencement ceremony as we do, I must tell you something very important and very real: This is your time.”

After several speakers, faculty read the names of graduates while their names appeared on screen on an image of an Oregon Tech diploma. Faculty for the various departments students received degrees in appeared on screen after all of the gradates for that department, where the instructors sent well wishes and congratulations to the students they worked with throughout the years.

While Naganathan acknowledged the change of course for spring term due to COVID-19, which was held remotely through online classes, he told the H&N that he felt both faculty and students met the challenge well.

Merkley, in his virtual address, highlighted some of the achievements of graduates, along with some noteworthy alumni activities.

“When the world says ‘how?’ those who specialize in technology say ‘here’s how,’” he said. “That’s where you, the Oregon Tech class of 2020 come in. Each of you has the instincts and the training to take on the challenges of this moment and the years to come.”

“You are in a unique position to use what you’ve learned and the knowledge that you can overcome any obstacle in your way, including a global pandemic, to create those ideas that will change the world.”

Jacobs encouraged graduates to remain resilient as they being their careers.

“I feel hopeful and inspired that you will play a significant role in shaping the bright future that is sure to come, and you should take great pride in what will be an extraordinary place in history as you work together to rebuild an even stronger, more prosperous, equitable and community-minded nation,” Jacobs said.

Student speaker Clark Anderson encouraged his fellow gradates to be more than just acceptable as they enter their careers.

“However, I want to encourage you to be more. More than just productive, more than just another cog in the machine, more than just another average employee. Be bold. Be brave. Be confident. Speak up. Stand out. Ask questions. Make yourself indispensable,” he said. “In short, leave every place you go better than when you found it. Make an impact. Leave a legacy that will make you proud of yourself, everyone around you proud to have known you and Oregon Tech proud to have been part of your story.”

Although Naganathan acknowledged that it was disappointing that they couldn’t have their traditional in-person ceremony, he still feels Oregon Tech’s virtual ceremony was memorable for the graduates.

“We have done our best, we are not sparing any effort, as a matter of fact, as a matter of symbolism, the provost, the dean and myself are going to be on campus, celebrating our students. We have taken care of as many details as possible so that this is a great celebration for our students,” he said. “While there are disappointments for that not being traditional, in some ways we are also making it special in our own way. I think people will remember this commencement in a unique way.”

Graduates could also come by the Klamath Falls campus to get pictures with Nagathan and other university leadership on Saturday. According to Oregon Tech, more than 1,300 people viewed the virtual ceremony in the first four hours on Saturday.

While COVID-19 made it more challenging for Oregon Tech students to finish their degrees, Naganathan said that it also created more opportunities for students to be involved in how their field changes through this pandemic, particularly health care fields.

“Instead of looking at it as only a challenge, I keep asking myself and asking my colleagues, so where are the opportunities?” he said. “Remote care may take a different level of achievement and this changes how we get cared for, and there lies the opportunities in innovating new programs and new opportunities for our students and our society.”

“I do not look at all of this as only a challenge. I think there are great opportunities to redefine education for the next fifty years by doing the right things right now.”

While whether or not students will be able to return to campus come fall term remains uncertain, Naganathan said they are planning for an in-person year in case it is possible.

Oregon Tech already had quite the catalog of online classes, so Naganathan said he felt they were more prepared than others for the required move to distance learning for spring term. Still, he said the university is known for its lab classes, and not being able to have those classes was tough.

“Considering all the challenges, I feel it was an amazing year in a sense of accomplishment, having overcome the challenges.”

Although the second part of the year took a challenging turn, Naganathan said that other achievements like the largest freshman class in the university’s history, new degree programs and new construction projects on campus helped make this year a success.

Naganathan described this graduating class as one that will utilize the adversity they faced this year to change the future.

“I know you are prepared to go out and transform the world, and so do all of your professors and staff who have supported you, as well as your families and friends,” Naganathan said in his commencement speech. “And when you help the world overcome this tremendous time of challenge and struggle, you will know that you have been part of bringing us back. And that, class of 2020, is your legacy. That is your 20/20 vision.”"|2
2020-06-14|"Hi folks, if you remember, recently I published a website for COVID 19 Tracker with React . How about we explore our strengths in WPF.

Almost everything is different in these 2 projects. They follow different implementation techniques with respect to their technologies.

Let's create a WPF application with an attractive UI. This project is for education purposes only.

I can't attach source code here due to the maximum size limit, but you can directly download it from Github.

Find the following Github repositories for both, and feel free to tag along on Github, leave a star if you like.

Things you will learn in this project:
• Using a material design with WPF to enhance the user experience
• Calling Web-API in any C# backed project with a HttpClient

We will learn each of these steps one by one.

Open Visual Studio & create a new WPF app, Name it as you wish.

First, we are going to add some basic panels.

Now, we need the beauty for our project. Let's add Material.Design.

Go to NuGet Package Manager & do the necessary requirements.

Now that we have added Material design in your project, we still need to import some of the styles. We can directly add them to App.xaml so that they will be available across the application.

Now let us begin with looks.

This is the code behind the add ButtonExit_Click method to add following code:

Now let's add ResourceDictionary in our project, Simply right-click on project & select ResouceDictionary. Name as a Styles.xaml

This is where we are going to keep all styles.

Add this entry in App.xaml as well.

We have divided our page into 3 sections, header which we already added, now we need...

The left panel is kind of navigation control across your entire application.

The right panel is where all 3 cards for confirmed, recovered & deaths count will be displayed, Plus the data of the last updated date & our attractive doughnut charts specifying recovery & fatality rate.

Here is the complete screen,

Now that we are done with designing a UI, Let's move further ahead and add that API class in your project:

We are going to use WebAPI class to make a call to API, For now, we are only using the get method.

This class is responsible for getting our data.

Of course, we are going to follow MVVM architecture. Let's add DataContext for our MainWindow.xaml.

StatusDetails is responsible for storing our API's response. We need to have the same property name as the JSON response that we get from our API.

For now, we are concerned about 4 specific properties:

This class acts as a controller. This is where your UI gets its data & functionalities.

Well, that's just beautiful. Hold on though, we are still missing something.

We forgot to add Itemsource for our Doughnut charts!

The doughnut is partitioned based on numbers and every number has its description associated with it, We need to have a class who can fulfill these needs.

We are going bind 2 properties of this class:

We are sending numbers that we received from API to doughnut chart to calculate the recovery & fatality rate:

Very well done, guys!

So far so good. Now just hit that Start button & embrace the happiness of successfully implementing Covid-19 tracker with WPF & Material design.

Here is the final outcome of your hard work:

We are not done yet, in the future, we will update our left panel and add more screens on the right panel.

This is going to be a good project if you desire to learn WPF.

In this article, we learned how to develop a WPF application with Material design and how to use WebAPI & How to bind properties to UI.

I really hope you have come away from this with a real grasp on how to develop a WPF application.

Thank you all, and I wish you the very best. Keep Learning & Keep Coding!

2020-06-14|"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a massive increase in the demand for essential medical equipment. This column discusses recent findings on the role of international trade of essential medical goods in exacerbating or mitigating the impact of a pandemic. The effects depend crucially on the countries’ trade imbalances in essential medical goods. Net importers of these goods are relatively worse off during a pandemic than net exporters. Although the welfare losses of net importers are lower in a world with high trade barriers, they benefit from reducing barriers once the pandemic arrives.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a massive increase in the demand for essential medical equipment to combat the spread of the disease. For instance, goods such as masks, gloves, respirators, and COVID-19 tests are playing a key role in allowing healthcare workers to respond to the ongoing pandemic. While supply has been gradually increasing to try to satisfy the high demand for these goods, countries continue to face supply shortages and are increasingly forced to ration these goods.

Amidst the growing fear of these supply shortages, countries have been resorting to trade policy to meet domestic demand. According to Evenett (2020), “a growing number of governments have been sickening their trading partners by banning or limiting the export of medical supplies.”

In our recent paper (Leibovici and Santacreu 2020), we document that the heterogeneous response of trade policy across countries is systematically related to the extent to which countries are net importers or net exporters of essential medical goods. We then develop a general equilibrium model of international trade to study the role of trade of essential goods in mitigating or exacerbating the effect of a pandemic like COVID-19.

We combine data on import liberalisations and export restrictions from Global Trade Alert with international trade flow data on essential medical products to fight COVID-19 from UN COMTRADE. We find that, of 109 countries studied, 29 countries have implemented some type of liberalisation on essential medical products since April 2020, whereas 59 countries have imposed restrictions. Moreover, recent changes to trade policy for essential medical goods appear to be systematically related to countries’ positions as net suppliers or net importers of these goods. As of 24 April, 86% of the countries with a trade surplus in these goods have recently imposed restrictive export policies, while this has been the case for only 46% of the countries with a trade deficit.

These findings suggest that international trade plays a fundamental role on the cross-country impact of a pandemic. In Leibovici and Santacreu (2020), we investigate the role of international trade of essential goods in mitigating or exacerbating this impact.

We ask two questions:

1. To what extent does the impact of a pandemic depend on whether countries are net exporters or net importers of essential goods?

2. What is the role of international trade in mitigating or exacerbating the impact of the pandemic?

We address these questions using a dynamic quantitative general equilibrium model with two countries and two sectors: one sector producing essential goods (i.e. medical equipment) and the other sector producing non-essential goods. There are adjustment costs to capital and labour in each sector.

We assume that both countries are symmetric throughout except that one country is relatively more productive in essential goods while the other is relatively more productive in non-essential goods, leading the former to be a net exporter of essential goods and the latter to be a net importer of essential goods.

To what extent does the impact of a pandemic depend on whether countries are net exporters or net importers of essential goods?

We find that, in our model, a global pandemic has significant heterogeneous effects across countries: net importers of essential goods are relatively worse off during a pandemic than net exporters. There are two main forces at play. First, given that it is costly to reallocate production inputs across sectors, producers of essential goods cannot sufficiently boost production, leading to a substantial increase in their relative price. Then, while the price of essential goods increases similarly in both economies, the effect on welfare depends on the countries' sectoral trade imbalances. Both countries earn relatively more for their sales of essential goods, and both countries have to spend relatively more for their purchases of these goods. However, given that the net importer is less productive in essential goods, this country sells less than it purchases, while the reverse is the case for net exporters. As a result, net importers of these goods are relatively worse off.

In Leibovici et al. (2020) we document that the US relies heavily on imports of essential medical goods. Thus, according to the model, the US is likely to be relatively worse off from the supply shortages of medical products amid the COVID-19 pandemic than if it were to be a net exporter of these goods.

What is the role of international trade in mitigating or exacerbating the impact of the pandemic?

We find that the level of international trade barriers at the onset of a pandemic can significantly alter its economic implications. In our model, higher initial trade costs imply that the net importer runs a smaller trade deficit of essential goods than in a world with lower trade costs, while the net exporter runs a smaller trade surplus in these goods. Therefore, while a pandemic continues to lead to a substantial increase in the relative price of essential goods, the relative impact on the home and foreign countries is mitigated. We thus conclude that while higher trade barriers on essential goods may reduce the amount consumed of these goods, they mitigate the potential vulnerability of net importers of these goods when a global pandemic hits.

These findings have important implications for the design of international trade policy. Even if countries may benefit on average from having cheaper access to goods, the reliance on international trade might put these countries in a vulnerable position if these goods are essential and either the supply or demand of these goods is subject to global shocks.

While these findings are informative about the ex-ante design of international trade policy, they are silent about the impact of trade policy changes implemented once a pandemic hits. We thus conclude our analysis by asking: What is the impact of raising trade barriers in response to a pandemic?

In contrast to the previous findings, we now find that raising trade barriers when the pandemic hits can significantly exacerbate the welfare cost faced by net importers of essential goods. As a net importer, the home country's production structure is such that it relies considerably on the foreign country for its consumption of essential goods. Thus, an increase in trade barriers on these goods exacerbates the already painful situation faced by the net importer, making the relative price of essential goods even higher.

These results suggest that the design of international trade policy for essential goods may suffer from a time-inconsistency problem. Net exporters of essential goods may ex-ante prefer to live in a world with low trade costs, but when a global pandemic hits they might be tempted to renege on their previous commitments and increase trade barriers. The reverse is the case for net importers of essential goods, as they ex-ante prefer to live in a world with high trade costs on these goods; but, when a global pandemic hits, they would be tempted to renege on their commitments and instead decrease trade barriers.

Events such as the current pandemic can lead to increased sentiment against international trade openness. Our research suggests there are no blanket solutions. Trade openness can be effective at addressing local shocks such as domestic pandemics, but it can raise tensions in the context of a global shock such as COVID-19. The design of trade policy agreements needs to be considered carefully to ensure we get the benefits of trade while minimising the potential pain when global shocks hit. This is a key challenge raised by COVID-19—one we should try to meet to avoid falling back into a world with high trade barriers and the large costs that it would entail. In Baldwin and Evenett (2020) several contributors discuss how governments should react to this type of crisis.

Finally, although we do not explicitly model supply chains, our column is related to an ongoing discussion on the disruption of global value chains amid COVID-19. The current pandemic raised questions on the potential vulnerability of relying on foreign supply chains during a global shock, leading to a surge in arguments for protectionism and self-reliance (Bonadio et al. 2020). As Pinelopi Goldberg argues, global coordination is important, given that global value chains can diversify risks through international trade.

2020-06-13|"It pains me to say this but Boris Johnson, exhausted and looking increasingly forlorn, appears to have a few short weeks to salvage his reputation and save his Government from ridicule.

Still recovering from his near-death experience with Covid-19, the Prime Minister faces unprecedented obstacles to prevent Britain slipping into a deep recession.

With so many cards stacked against him, our sallow-faced and hollow-eyed leader has squandered much of the goodwill he accumulated after his landslide Election victory in December.

Even his friends whisper that there is no captain on the bridge steering the ship. According to a YouGov poll, Johnson’s handling of the virus is rated as the worst of all world leaders.

Many will discount the criticism as unfair. Contrary to predictions of doom from the Left, the NHS has performed brilliantly.

Eight million workers have been protected by the Chancellor’s £80 billion furlough package. Most of the country is becoming free of Covid. Despite our economy shrinking by 20 per cent in April, it still ticks over.

Johnson’s misfortune is that those achievements have been drowned out by the impression of defeat. Hampered by Downing Street’s cack-handed communications, Johnson is mischievously blamed for orchestrating a shambles.

Some believe his seeming impassivity, sporadic public appearances and blustering press conferences are proof he’s still suffering the after-effects of Covid, combined with sleepless nights with a six-week-old baby.

Some of his harshest critics have boldly stated that if he had still been married to Marina, his long-suffering ex-wife ‘who was unafraid to dispense home truths’, Johnson’s life would be more stable than with a fiancee 23 years his junior.

Such censure, though, ignores Boris’s strength. Over the years, he has successfully compartmentalised his private and public lives.

And since there is no obvious leading Tory who might put themselves forward as an alternative Prime Minister, his supporters are convinced that not all is lost.

Just as his hero Winston Churchill led Britain out of its Darkest Hour in 1940, Johnson needs to summon the courage, ideas and energy to enthuse the nation with a blueprint that will stop us coming out of lockdown in tatters.

He also needs to fire failing Ministers – of which there are several – and Civil Service time-servers on whom he has mistakenly relied.

The fact is he has little time. No later than July 1, just 18 days away, Johnson needs to address Parliament and then the nation on TV to give the country confidence to believe that his Government machine is firing on all cylinders.

We all need to be reassured that we can rely on the Prime Minister to restore normality as quickly as possible.

Johnson’s priorities must be to revive the economy; reopen all schools; launch a major resurgence of Britain’s cultural institutions such as cinemas, museums, concert halls and theatres; encourage pubs and restaurants to reopen; and finally, to rebuild his Government with inspiring and gifted politicians.

It is exactly five weeks ago that Johnson lost his halo. His disastrous TV address changing the slogan from ‘Stay Home’ to ‘Stay Alert’ was confusing, vague and greeted by widespread irritation.

Accused of confusing the message, Johnson lost a huge amount of public goodwill.

Until then, many had tolerated the failure to provide NHS staff with sufficient protective gowns, for example, blaming the global shortage. Many also understood the crisis in privately owned care homes was not politicians’ fault.

But Johnson’s reputation took a second battering. His apparently flippant dismissal of the allegations against Dominic Cummings for breaking the spirit of the lockdown was a self-inflicted disaster that exposed a gross misunderstanding of the national mood.

In the past, he had listened to the advice of loyal friends outside the Downing Street bunker. Suddenly, to avoid criticism, he is shunning their calls.

In explaining his plan to relax the lockdown, the PM needed senior civil servants to deliver a clear, common-sense scheme. But they failed.

In truth, Johnson has been let down by Whitehall’s perennial bunglers. Then he refused to identify and remove the guilty parties.

By character, Johnson has an aversion to confrontation. To date, he has accepted all the scientists’ advice. That must end.

We now know that their advice until mid-March was muddled or even wrong. We also know that the scientists now disagree on the best course forward.

Johnson, in his DNA a libertarian and free-marketeer, must follow his instincts and unshackle himself from the scientists’ chains. He should gamble that the risk of a few extra deaths is outweighed by the urgent need to reopen the country.

Admittedly, confrontation often ends in bloodshed but this is the only way for Johnson to restore his credibility. Simultaneously, he must change his way of governing. Until now, he has delegated most critical decisions to Ministers.

Unwisely, he allowed Home Secretary Priti Patel to announce a 14-day quarantine on travellers entering the UK – something that is unenforceable and has been widely ridiculed.

Similarly, he relied on Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, but he has blundered embarrassingly over the reopening of schools.

And, most alarmingly, he has depended on Health Secretary Matt Hancock to mastermind the ‘war’ against Covid. It is shocking that Britain is third in the world death league from the virus despite only having the 21st largest population.

The public has lost trust in Hancock, of whom retired Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption wrote last week: ‘With his hectoring manner, authoritarian assumptions and snarling threats, [he] has resembled nothing so much as the petulant headmaster of a third- rate school.’

It’s not just ministerial incompetence. No 10 is staffed by people of mixed ability. At its heart is Sir Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary.

Having trained in the Home Office, his specialism is security, which means he’s been poorly equipped to mobilise the Whitehall machine to tackle Covid.

He also neglected to point out to Johnson the dysfunctional performance of senior officials in Public Health England, the Department of Health and hospital trusts.

Johnson should ignore his benign instincts and fire Sir Mark, replacing him with a thrusting agent of change. At the same time, he should replace the senior civil servants at health, education and defence. All have failed to deliver.

Whitehall needs to be revolutionised to get Britain back on its feet.

A litmus test of whether the medicine is working will be when we hear the screams of protest by the Luddite civil service trade unions.

Just three months ago, pre-Covid, the Johnson Government’s first Budget spelled out an exciting One Nation vision.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled a visionary £30 billion plan to rebuild our infrastructure and finance a huge expansion to reboot Britain. The Government should double that investment.

Ministers must learn that we over-relied on the power of globalisation and on China. Of course, that will need an army of experts – so, in the short term, Britain should recruit from around the world.

Spending money to rebuild is easy compared to the parallel task of winning the political battle.

Covid aside, Boris Johnson is under attack by those in denial that the Tories won a landslide Election victory just six months ago and who want to reverse Brexit.

Defeating those enemies requires courage and conviction. No one doubts that Johnson had both these qualities before his illness, but now there are worrying signs he is lacking the energy to fight simultaneously on many fronts.

Indeed, his enemies smell blood. Militant teachers have seized the upper hand and shown that their selfish interests are more important than the education of the nation’s children.

Anarchist mobs have hijacked the Black Lives Matter protests. Michel Barnier, the EU’s Brexit negotiator, thinks he can bully Britain over our exit deal. The BBC has become a mouthpiece for anti-Tory criticism.

Wales, run by Labour, and the Nationalist government in Scotland, are defiantly following different policies from those pursued in London.

Boris Johnson, an acute student of history, will recall he has experienced a similar hiatus. Six months into his time as London Mayor, in 2008, his administration was mired in chaos. Key appointments were exposed as disastrous.

After their swift dismissal, the arrival of a new chief of staff, Simon Milton, transformed Johnson’s mayoralty.

Now, to up his game, it’s not City Hall that Johnson must rejuvenate, but his Cabinet and Downing Street team.

On a personal level, too, Johnson needs to change gear. He must show he is in charge. He must offer a vision and a big strategy.

Above all, it is imperative that the man who has been seen for years as a great communicator actually communicates better.

At least, for the present, he knows that whatever his critics – and they are growing in number daily – throw at him, he is the only politician with the capacity to unify and lead Britain. But even that certainty can quickly disappear.

2020-06-13|"World number one Novak Djokovic lost one of his two opening singles matches on Saturday at the charity tournament he organized, and his day got worse when news broke that one of the event's four legs has been scrapped due to coronavirus concerns.

Shortly after beating fellow Serbian Viktor Troicki in his opening match, Djokovic said he was disappointed that the Adria Tour's third leg in Montenegro, scheduled for June 27-28, had been called off.

""I am so sad for the Montenegro leg,"" he told the Balkan nation's Sport Klub television in a courtside interview in front of a capacity 4,000 crowd.

""We tried everything, but the borders are still not open and we don't have time to organize it all.""

With 12,251 confirmed cases and 253 deaths related to COVID-19, Serbia is among the countries whose residents are not allowed to travel to its southern neighbor Montenegro.

Earlier on Saturday, Djokovic's younger brother Djordje and the Adria Tour director, released a statement saying the event's board had decided to scrap the Montenegro leg.

Asked at a news conference after his defeat by Filip Krajinovic whether there was an alternative host nation able to replace Montenegro in a fortnight, Djokovic said:

""We are looking at several alternative options and locations which I don't want to reveal at this point. We are running out of time so we will know where we stand either tomorrow or the day after.""

The second leg will be held in Croatia's coastal resort of Zadar on June 20-21 and the final one in Bosnia's Banja Luka on July 3-4.

The tournament, organized by Djokovic while international tennis remains suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has drawn some household names and adopted a more streamlined format than the main tour events.

Sets have been slashed to the best of seven games, with eight players competing in two pools on a round-robin basis.

Having beaten Troicki in straight sets, Djokovic lost 4-2, 2-4, 1-4 to Krajinovic.

Second seed and Austrian world number three Dominic Thiem beat Damir Dzumhur in minutes as the Bosnian retired in the opening set with a hamstring injury, but had to save a match point in his 1-4, 4-1, 4-3 win over Dusan Lajovic.

Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov beat Lajovic in three sets but was stunned 4-1, 4-3 by home crowd favourite Nikola Milojevic - drafted in to replace Dzumhur.

World number seven Alexander Zverev beat Krajinovic 0-4, 4-3, 4-3 and was playing Troicki in a late match starting after midnight local time.

The third-round pool matches will be played on Sunday afternoon followed by a final between the group winners."|1

2020-06-15|"The worst is over. Hopefully, we will never again see such a terrible death toll from an infectious disease in Ireland. The response of the public, North and South, has been fantastic. When it comes to safeguarding health, the public has always proven to be more than willing do what is needed to avoid catastrophic illness.

As Shaw wrote over a century ago, the public “dreads disease and desires to be protected against it”. As we have seen, sometimes communities took the initiative themselves, with parents keeping their children out of school and heads closing schools ahead of central instruction.

The numbers of deaths and of new positive cases in Ireland have fallen steadily North and South. As they have reached a low level there is an understandable clamour to get back to normal. The effects of the restrictions on all aspects of life have been immense.

The damage done to businesses and individuals will have health consequences that have yet to materialise or be fully appreciated. The very restricted operation of health services will take time to restore and even longer to deal with the backlogs of routine and even urgent care that have built up.

Psychiatrists have predicted a “tsunami” of mental health problems following the crisis arising from conditions exacerbated or created by all that we have been through.

The bit that no one really wishes to hear and those dutybound to deliver the message keep saying, is that we are not done with this coronavirus yet. As long as the virus is present and is still being transmitted in our communities, workplaces and institutions we risk significant flare-ups.

Importantly, if those flare-ups are not stamped out immediately, the highly infectious nature of the virus has the potential to cause substantially more deaths and disruption.

What is needed, with great urgency, is a concerted effort to achieve a “Zero Covid-19 Ireland”. This will involve getting to zero new cases in both parts of the island and then maintaining and if necessary restoring that position. The resulting economic and social benefits would be enormous.

Arguments about distances of 1, 1.5m or 2m would be a thing of the past and our schools, theatres, arts centres, clubs and pubs could get back to enhancing our lives and reconnecting our communities. There is absolutely no reason why this cannot be achieved.

Two things about this task are very clear. Firstly, lifting a high proportion of restrictions in a country before eliminating the virus is a recipe for playing an ongoing and exhausting game of cat and mouse with this deadly foe. The consequences could be continued, and possibly massive disruption.

The global number of new cases per day continues to grow and resurgence is apparent in some places that have ended lockdown prematurely.

Secondly, as far as Ireland is concerned the task of eliminating all new cases of the virus occurring through domestic spread, ie not coming from newly imported cases, can only realistically be carried out on an all-island basis.

The endgame for Covid-19 is not yet in sight. Researchers around the world are working on the development of more than 135 separate vaccines. There is no guarantee that an effective vaccine will be found and we would be unwise to plan on that basis.

The best option for Ireland is a joint North-South initiative empowered and resourced to hunt down the remaining cases and hot spots for the virus and deal with them as swiftly as possible.

Learning the lessons from countries, such as South Korea and Germany, that are further along the path shows that the capacity to react urgently to any flare-ups must be strengthened and maintained for the foreseeable future.

Changes are, of course, needed to harmonise efforts on the island. These include details that should have been sorted out by now anyway, such as the different isolation times of seven and 14 days on either side of the Border and the fact that “shortness of breath” is a recognised and listed symptom of Covid-19 in the South but not the North. But getting a jointly agreed case finding, testing, contact tracing, isolate, and support (FTTIS) system is the big priority.

In Border counties in particular, the ability to deal with cases and contacts on both sides of the Border in a seamless way is crucial. In doing the job well speed is everything.

Serious east-west issues will arise. As the island gets close to “zero” status the focus will be firmly on stopping the importation on new cases. Agreed measures to prevent the virus being reintroduced via ports and airports will be crucial.

These are not constitutional issues – they are public health issues. They are not about sovereignty – they are about human lives and the preservation of jobs and a functioning economy.

We can revert to tribal allegiances in due course if we really want to, but in the meantime let’s get the job done. Dr Gabriel Scally is president of epidemiology and public health at the Royal Society of Medicine in , London"|2
2020-06-15|"East Vancouver parent Christa Wagner was a bit hesitant to send her twin eight-year-old boys back to school after being off since March break due to the pandemic, but she can't argue with the results.

""Obviously it's a little bit different, but honestly they loved it. They had so much fun,"" Wagner said.

The boys are back in class for two full days a week. Normally they share their teacher with 23 other children, but since they've been back at their school, St. Francis of Assisi, classrooms are limited to only eight students.

""It's been fantastic,"" Wagner said. ""The school has done an amazing job.""

In March, the provincial government shut down schools to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

Starting June 1, elementary students could return for 50 per cent in-class instruction, while middle and secondary school children were limited to one day a week. Children of essential-service workers and those needing additional supports have been able to attend full-time.

The province says less than a third have returned with more children in elementary school and fewer in secondary school. Numbers also vary from school to school, the province says, and class to class.

Parents, children and teachers are reporting mixed experiences with how that shift has gone so far. One thing that most agree on is that it's been a teachable moment for everyone, with hints of what may come this fall.

Some parents say the routine and structure of school has been helpful for their kids.

Rae-Anne Schneider, whose 15-year-old daughter Neve has Trisomy 9 Mosaic, a rare chromosomal disorder that causes physical and cognitive impairments, says her daughter's been glad to return to school full-time.

""Without the routine it's really difficult for her,"" Schneider said. ""Behaviorally, that gets challenging.""

Schneider has been off work for the past couple of months to care for Neve full-time.

As the parent of a child with complex needs, she had support available, but was concerned about the risk of her daughter catching the coronavirus because her immune system is compromised.

When schools opened up again, she felt it was time for Neve to go back.

""I love her to death, but I think sometimes it's good that we get a little break from each other,"" she said.

For many children who have returned to school, the best part has been reconnecting with their friends and teachers.

""I was really happy to see my friends again and it was easier to work when my brothers weren't annoying,"" said Lord Selkirk student Oscar Needoba.

In school, children like Oscar have faced what will likely be the new normal for months to come.

Teachers wearing masks, lines painted on the ground to enforce social distancing and desks pushed apart in classrooms are just some measures schools have put in place.

Despite those precautions, many parents say the risks are still too great for their kids to return to school.

Like the majority of parents in B.C., Vancouver mother Victoria Harper chose to keep her twin 10-year-old girls at home. One of them has asthma, she says, and the other was terrified of catching the coronavirus.

""It was such an emotional decision,"" Harper said.

Life at home, Harper says, has been a surprisingly enjoyable change from the fast pace of pre-COVID life when the family juggled cooking classes, badminton lessons and swimming.

But schooling at home and over the Internet has become a challenge.

""Both of them are at the point where they don't even want to do online schooling right now,"" she said. ""They're just losing interest.""

Luckily for Harper, the end is in sight as most classes break for summer on June 25.

Teachers too have had some relief with the return to in-class instruction, but also new challenges.

Terri Mooring, president of the B.C. Teachers Federation, says many teachers say they're glad to see their students again. The new safety protocols were strange for teachers and students alike at first, Mooring says, but everyone has adapted quickly.

The biggest issue Mooring says she is hearing from teachers is that with some students back and others still at home, teachers are doing double duty preparing two types of instruction for the same class.

""It's been incredibly labour intensive and not sustainable,"" Mooring said. ""Their workloads have exponentially increased.""

Mooring says it will be important for planning to take place this summer to help teachers better manage their course loads and work schedules.

Like education and school officials, Mooring doesn't yet know what September will bring in terms of in-class instruction. She thinks there will continue to be a mix of online and in-person learning, but she's hopeful conditions for teachers will improve.

""We anticipate that things will be better than they are right now,"" she said."|0
2020-06-15|"Those selected to be privately sponsored refugees must now wait until the Canadian border re-opens before they can commence international travel to Canada. This protracted waiting situation has left many people stranded. Some sponsored refugees have been living in or forced to return to overcrowded refugee camps. Others are waiting in hotels near airports and transit centres. Still others are searching for shelter after relinquishing accommodation prior to their cancelled departure. These already deemed refugees who have been selected for resettlement are being pushed back, which is prolonging their trauma. In these situations, they may face financial challenges, underserved accommodations, and health risks. The suspended settlement operations have also halted family reunification for those privately sponsored refugees awaiting the arrival of family members to Canada.

While sponsored refugees selected for resettlement to Canada are now blocked from entering the country, there are other privately sponsored refugees who have lived in Canada for more than one year and are experiencing the re-bordering of their lives. Since they no longer receive financial support from their sponsors, they are facing employment instability, unable to pay rent, access health care or adequate food for their families due to the coronavirus. Some are relying on their savings, child benefit payments, food banks, welfare, or financial support from family in order to survive.

Since many privately sponsored refugees are engaged in service work, they are particularly impacted as a consequence of reduced openings of several businesses due to the official ban on large gatherings in Canada. For example, some sponsored Syrian refugees who have lived in the Kitchener-Waterloo region have recently experienced unemployment. One Syrian taxi driver was unable to drive a taxi due to the coronavirus. This jobless situation created difficulties for him to pay rent and access adequate food for his family. A Syrian single-mother of three who cleans houses for low wages was unemployed for several weeks. She too has suffered from a lack of income and, until recently, relied on child benefit payments to pay household bills. A Syrian father of four was forced to close his small sewing business for two months. This situation enabled him to apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), but still left him with inadequate funds to support his family.

The eligibility requirement for CERB – that the applicant should earn a minimum employment income of $5,000 in the previous year, creates challenges for those privately sponsored refugees who work intermittently or earn low wages. A representative from the Salmon Arm Refugee Group in British Columbia stated that it is “difficult and time-consuming for privately sponsored refugees to fill out forms for CERB, even with the assistance of their sponsors.” The representative stressed that privately sponsored Syrian refugees are using their child benefit payments to pay for food, clothes, and other expenditures. Yet, many other sponsored refugees have constricted options to look for other jobs and are compelled to work despite growing health risks.

In addition to their precarious employment, sponsored refugees may also face health challenges. Some privately sponsored Syrian refugees living in the Kitchener-Waterloo Region are hesitant to access health care because of their fear of contracting the virus at clinics or hospitals and infecting their family members. Due to practicing physical distancing measures, some sponsored refugees have experienced the triggering of previous mental health issues, including anxiety, solitude, or limited access to support networks."|1

2020-06-15|"If there is one voice that has permeated lockdown, it’s Joe Duffy’s. Liveline is of course an Irish institution, but like many things it has taken on an elevated meaning during the pandemic. Its hearth-like ability to form a space where people can gather around and hear a diverse range of voices has once again excelled when it is most needed. Spending a lot of time inside, we look for connections to the outside, and Liveline provides.

Duffy has steered many excellent conversations throughout, be they on racism, education equality, the human cost of the pandemic, and everything in between. The lockdown initially made us appreciate the so-called simple things, but it also allows us to consider what is “simple” as actually complex. Duffy is the most empathic presenter at RTÉ, with the kind of authenticity, sophistication and intuition that validates public service broadcasting as almost beyond an essential service."|2
2020-06-15|"[We repeat the reviewers’ points here in italic, and include our replies point by point, as well as a description of the changes made, in Roman.]

We want to thank the editor and the reviewers for their excellent comments and suggestions. We have gone over them all and made changes accordingly. Most importantly, some of the comments have caused an update of the data set, which changes some of the findings and allows us to fine-tune the analysis. Since we initially harvested data in April 2020, PubMed has changed its interface and now provides better (and more consistent) information on author affiliations. This allows a much more precise analysis of author country, as requested by one of the reviewers. This was not possible previously.

We address this data update in the paper, in an effort to be as transparent about the process as possible, but for good measure, we would like to mention here the original sample, which was 9,050 COVID-19 papers, of which 1,179 had gender for first and last author, and at least one US-based author. These numbers are now 15,839 and 1,893 respectively. When analyzing first-authors, we restrict to US-based first authors and vice versa for last authors.

Below, we list the comments from the reviewers and editor in italics and our responses in regular font face.

We have uploaded the data and the analytical scripts to OSF. The project is private right now, but we will make it public when/if our paper is published. An R script is provided, which will allow full analysis from the most raw data set we are able to provide (gender is inferred and information from PubMed is extracted into a table).

2) The robustness of author gender determination is not clear, and the methods should be described in more depth. For example, the text states ""Gender was reliably estimated for 81.9% of the entire sample"": what does ""reliably estimated"" mean here? How is the accuracy of the gender estimation tool established? What is the likelihood that a given gender was determined correctly? Doing spot checks of a random sample of authors can be helpful. Additionally, adding more information on the specific methods used for inferring gender from author names would be useful.

Checking the correctness of gender assignment is of course important. Our data relies on an algorithm, which we have previously used and checked for robustness. We realize that this was not apparent from the very short comment in the paper, and have added a little more detail about which algorithm we used and that robustness checks have previously been performed.

We have adjusted the method so that we now only compare US first and last authors. We believe this is a strength of the study because it allows us to isolate the effect to a single country and the timing of both disease and social constraints. For the analysis of the full author group, there could potentially be a bias, which we address in the limitations.

4) I am not convinced by the authors' argument that the observed differences are not due to a specialty bias. By looking at COVID-19-specific papers only, they are looking at the gender distribution of authors in a specific field, and comparing them to the gender distribution of authors in a variety of other fields who happen to publish in similar journals. It is entirely possible that there is a gender bias in coronavirus research, for example- this would not be captured by journal specialty, but would be seen in gender proportions for COVID-19 papers. Please add additional columns to table 1 looking at all research published in these journals in 2020 (not just COVID-19-related research), and/or discuss at greater length the possibility of specialty bias in your results.

While this is certainly an important point, we also have to disagree, for two reasons. COVID-19 specific papers are not from a specific field. On the contrary, the vast majority of medical specialties have picked up research on COVID-19 in one way or another. The search for cures or vaccines are likely limited, but discussions about implications for treatment of other diseases span all of clinical medicine. Secondly, our reason for using COVID-19 research as the “treatment” case was not to look specifically into this, but rather to have a sample of papers where we knew the research would have to be done in 2020. If we introduced a new column of “other” 2020 papers from the same journals, it would be impossible to know which of these had been in the pipeline since 2019 or earlier, and which were actually based on research from 2020.

5) The authors limited their samples to papers with at least one US author. It could be useful to know, of the 1179 papers in the treatment group, how many papers had more than one US author? I'm concerned that this limitation may introduce confounding factors. Knowing how many of these papers were published by teams of scientists primarily working in the US, vs a single scientist working in the US with a larger international team, would address this concern and more strongly support the authors' point that the disparity in female authorship can be potentially linked to the social restrictions in the US.

We hope that the changes to how we analyze first and last authors (analysis of first/last author gender restricted to first/last authors from the US) also addresses this point. For the share of women in the full group, this remains a valid concern, but not one we are currently able to address. While PubMed has now introduced per-author affiliations, it is not realistic to use these to make statistical analyses. When we claim to look only at papers with US-authors, this is really a conservative claim; there are certainly more papers with US addresses, but where the country or state is not included in the affiliation, or included in non-standardized forms. Our database contains more than sixty thousand “countries” from the affiliations, as there is no standard formatting of PubMed affiliations. We have trawled all of these for combinations of “USA”, “United States”, “America”, state names, names of major cities etc., to find the most complete set of affiliations related to the USA. However, we are not able to provide a reliable estimate of the national distribution of affiliations of all authors."|1
2020-06-16|"We thank the reviewer for this comment. Unfortunately, we did not manage to knock out PKR in Huh7.5 cells before the lab was closed due to COVID-19. As the reviewer suggests, we do not expect this to make a difference to HCV replication but we have not managed to test this. We have therefore not been able to further study the role of PKR in distinguishing HCV permissivity of Huh7 and 7.5. We believe that this omission does not impact the conclusions in the manuscript. We have re-iterated that the differences between Huh7 and 7.5 cells are multifactorial with the following text:

“Furthermore, our results suggest that a deficiency in PKR-dependent responses, as well as defective RIG-I (Sumpter et al., 2005), may contribute to Huh7.5 cell permissivity for HCV replication, which is consistent with previous observations showing that RIG-I does not play a role (Binder et al., 2007). Indeed, differences in permissivity between Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells are likely governed by a combination of factors, including RIG-I (Sumpter et al., 2005) and CD81 (Koutsoudakis et al., 2007), among others.”

We did over-express PKR in Huh7.5 cells, which inhibited HCV replication. However, we observed that overexpressed PKR was highly active (autophosphorylated) even in the absence of a stimulus, which does not accurately recapitulate the situation in unmodified cells (e.g. Huh7 cells, Figure 7—figure supplement 2A), where PKR is normally inactive (unphosphorylated) until a stimulus is added. Thus, we have not included these particular data in the manuscript as we believe this would complicate the story, without affecting our conclusions about the CypI mechanism. Moreover, these data are similar to those we obtain in the Huh7 PKR KO cells (Author response image 1), which we have included. We have also discussed the issue of over-expressed PKR being constitutively active as relates to these data.

We thank the reviewer for this important comment. The question of re-expression of PKR in the knockout lines is one we had considered. In the original study, we did not test this because we expected that PKR over-expression would induce translation shutdown as has been described previously (e.g. Grolleau et al., 2000), and would confound our results. Nonetheless, we have now stably over-expressed PKR in Huh7 PKR KO cells and evaluated HCV replication and its sensitivity to CsA inhibition. Over-expressed PKR was highly active, as shown by its robust autophosphorylation even in the absence of a stimulus (Western blot in new Figure 7—figure supplement 2). We found that PKR expression had an inhibitory effect on HCV replication, possibly through suppression of host and viral translation (as evidenced by the autophosphorylation of over-expressed PKR). For this reason, this experiment does not strictly recapitulate the situation in Huh7 cells. That is, the over-expressed PKR is already phosphorylated and activated (see Figure 7—figure supplement 2) instead of un-phosphorylated as in Huh7 cells. Therefore, while PKR over-expression reduced HCV replication, it did not affect HCV sensitivity to CsA. We propose that over-expressed PKR cannot enhance CsA sensitivity, because PKR is already activated and suppressing HCV replication independently of CsA-induced antiviral signaling. We had hoped to examine this further, but did not have time before the COVID-19 closure of the lab.

These data are now shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 2, and we have added the following text:

“We also sought to confirm the role of PKR in CypI activity by over-expressing PKR in Huh7 PKR knockout cells. However, PKR over-expression in itself led to PKR activation, as evidenced by its autophosphorylation (Figure 7—figure supplement 2A). […] This is consistent with previous observations of translation shutdown on PKR overexpression (Grolleau et al., 2000; Barber et al., 1993; Chong et al., 1992; Thomis and Samuel, 1992).”

In the manuscript (originally Figure 6D, now Figure 7D), we observed highly similar results in two PKR KO clones, which were prepared by single-cell cloning. Furthermore, treatment of cells with a PKR inhibitor (originally Figure 6G, now Figure 7G) led to the same phenotype. We also have more new C16 data supporting a role for PKR (Figure 7G). Thus, while the PKR reconstitution experiment did not yield clear results, we propose that together, these data are sufficiently compelling.

As described above, PKR over-expression does not accurately recapitulate the situation in naïve cells in that overexpressed PKR is highly active (autophosphorylated) even in the absence of a stimulus. This makes it difficult to evaluate the effect on the sensitivity of HCV to CypI, which we propose relies on more subtle PKR-mediated activation of IRF1, in the absence of translation shutoff. We have instead focused on an alternative approach to provide further evidence for a role for PKR using the PKR inhibitor C16 (Figure 7G).

This is a very helpful suggestion. We have now compared the effect of the C16 PKR inhibitor in Huh7 and Huh7 knocked out for PKR. The result was as expected and PKR knockout prevents the effect of C16 on CsA sensitivity.

These new data are included as Figure 7G. We have added the following to the text:

“C16 decreased CsA potency in Huh7 cells, but not in Huh7 PKR KO cells (Figure 7G), and only minimally affected CsA potency against HCV in Huh7.5 cells (Figure 7—figure supplement 1).”

This is another important point. We have now evaluated the antiviral activities of daclatasvir (NS5A inhibitor) and telaprevir (NS3/4A protease inhibitor) in Huh7 and Huh7 PKR KO cells. As expected, the presence or absence of PKR did not affect HCV sensitivity to these other inhibitors. These data are now shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 3. We have added the following text:

“We next tested whether the absence of PKR broadly affects the sensitivity of HCV to the antiviral activity of telaprevir (NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and daclatasvir (NS5A inhibitor) in Huh7 and Huh7 PKR KO cells. […] Collectively, these data are consistent with a specific role for PKR in the enhanced antiviral activity of CypI in Huh7 cells.”

We have now re-structured the manuscript to present the IFN-β/ruxolitinib data earlier, in what is now Figure 4. We have also sought to clarify that the observed phenotype is not dependent on IFN-β signalling and IFN induced gene expression, but is rather a cell-intrinsic response (i.e., gene expression dependent on PKR-IRF1 activation) with IFN-β being one of many antiviral genes induced upon CypI treatment of Huh7, but not Huh7.5 cells. We now show the activation of other antiviral genes, which are predominantly IRF1-dependent, in Figure 4. To confirm that the effect is not mediated by IFN, we performed further experiments using an interferon receptor (IFNAR) blocking antibody. As for ruxolitinib, IFNAR blockade did not affect the CypI potency against HCV, although it did rescue HCV replication from the inhibitory effect of IFN. This data is presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 3.

We have added the following text:

“The notion that IFN was not required for maximal CypI activity was also supported by an experiment using antihuman interferon alpha/beta receptor chain 2 antibody (IFNAR) to inhibit IFN activity through receptor blockade. […] However, in vivo, IFN induction would be expected to influence HCV replication and adaptive immune responses and thus the antiviral activity of CypI in patients.”

Unfortunately, we did not manage to complete this experiment before our qPCR machine was requisitioned for COVID-19 testing outside UCL. Nonetheless, RLR/MAVS-dependent antiviral responses have previously been documented in Huh7 cells and we have now cited these studies more prominently. We have added new text reiterating this point:

“Huh7 cells are capable of responding to cytosolic RNA and initiating antiviral signalling through RIG-I, MAVS and IRF3 (Sumpter et al., 2005; Binder et al., 2007). […] Therefore, we first hypothesized that the active RIG-I pathway in Huh7 cells contributes to the antiviral signalling induced by CypI.”

We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We attempted to evaluate replication of the Con1 (genotype 1b) replicon (Lohmann et al. 2003 J. Virol. 77: 3007-3019). Despite significant effort, we were unable to get the Con1 replicon to replicate in our Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells. In the past month, we obtained the Huh7-Lunet cell line, which better supports Con1 replication. We were able to observe weak replication in Huh7-Lunet cells, but ran out of time before the COVID-19 lab closure and were unable to evaluate the effect of CypA depletion or CypI treatment in the presence or absence of PKR in the Huh7-Lunet cell line.

Importantly, Kaul et al., 2009, evaluated replication of the Con1 replicon in CypA-depleted Huh7-Lunet cells and Huh7.5 cells. CypA depletion in Huh7-Lunet cells profoundly inhibited HCV replication by approximately 3 logs at 48 hours, and had a lesser impact in Huh7.5 cells (Kaul et al., 2009, Figure 2B). These data suggest that our findings are relevant for other HCV genotypes and we now cite this study to make this point in the Discussion as follows:

“Notably, a differential requirement for CypA in Huh7-Lunet and Huh7.5 cells has also been observed for replication of genotype 1b (Con1) and genotype 2a (JFH-1) replicons (Kaul et al., 2009), suggesting that these mechanisms are consistent across HCV genotypes.”

We agree with the reviewer that we had over-generalized our conclusions and in fact the mechanisms we have identified here may or may not be applicable to other viruses. To address this concern, we have limited our discussion in the current manuscript to HCV, with the exception of where we have cited literature describing other viruses and CypA.

We thank the reviewer for pointing out this lack of clarity in our Discussion. This was partly due to a typographical error where we had mixed up CypA and CypB in the"|2

2020-06-16|"“I in my chair with such a crew,” says the captain of a cargo vessel in the South Atlantic en route from Bermuda to Singapore. He is eight months into a four-month contract, and almost everyone on board has also already worked at least double his contracted time. He hopes Singapore will accept that sailors who have seen almost no one but each other for months pose no infection risk and permit a crew change. If not, some may refuse to keep working. On June 16th an industry-wide agreement to allow emergency contract extensions expired, but that is no guarantee that ports will open up. “Believe me,” he says, “the situation is critical.”

When Rose George, a journalist, wrote about the shipping industry in 2013, she called her book “Ninety Percent of Everything” to convey its importance to global trade. But during the covid-19 crisis almost none of the mariners who keep the world fed, warmed and entertained have been allowed on shore. At any moment 1.2m are in cargo vessels on the high seas. (Half as many again work on cruise ships or vessels transporting goods within a single country’s territory.) At least 250,000 have finished their contracts and have no idea when they will be relieved. Similar numbers are stuck at home with no idea when they will next get work. Both totals are rising by tens of thousands each week.

In normal times, crewing the world’s merchant fleet is a logistical miracle. Ship-management firms handle the rosters, signing crew on, flying them from their home countries to a convenient port, and getting them off their ships again and on a plane home. Many mariners are from developing countries, in particular India, Indonesia and the Philippines. They often start and end their contracts in hubs such as Dubai, Hong Kong and Singapore. Contracts are typically of three to nine months, with one month’s variation in either direction to make planning easier.

The virus has thrown an almighty spanner in the works. Countries that classified lorry drivers, pilots and cabin crew as essential workers overlooked merchant seamen, even though their work underpins the global economy. Some will accept their citizens, but ships may not be calling at a suitable port, and management companies may not be able to line up relief. With few scheduled flights, the sailors who manage to disembark may not be able to get home.

At first they were proud to be able to help in the global emergency, says Lars Robert Pedersen of , which represents the owners of about 60% of the world’s merchant fleet. They are used to hard work and long contracts. But when official neglect continued, sailors’ morale became a problem. “They are fed every day, and they are getting paid, but that’s not the point,” he says. “They are effectively imprisoned on board their ships.”

Owners and managers are trying to make confinement more bearable with free internet and wage top-ups, says Andreas Hadjipetrou, the managing director of Columbia Shipmanagement. “One captain asked for gym equipment and karaoke,” he says. “The crew created a band and sent us a video clip.” More importantly, they are doing everything they can to facilitate crew changes—which take not just planning, but a hefty dose of luck.

Among the merchant seamen relieved during the lockdown is Hrisheet Barve, a ship’s captain and an Indian from the state of Goa. By the end of May he and 16 crew members, also Indian, were months over contract. Since they were sailing along India’s coast, he proposed to the ship’s management company, Anglo-Eastern, that it divert to the port of Cochin in the state of Kerala for a crew change. The company agreed, despite the cost and delay. Even though the men were all nationals, disembarking required lengthy negotiations with the shipping ministry and port and state officials. They had seen no one else for months, but still had to spend two weeks in quarantine.

By the end, says Captain Barve, he was very worried about his men’s mental state. “When you’re all in the same boat—pun not intended—you can pull each other down.” And tired, miserable sailors are unsafe, he adds. “It just takes one captain to make a mistake and run a tanker aground and cause an oil spill. They will say it was a navigational error but the real culprit will be that he was working way longer than he should have been.”

The International Maritime Organisation, the arm of the that deals with shipping, has drawn up a protocol for crew changes during the pandemic. It requires governments to classify merchant seamen as essential workers, thus enabling them to travel and cross borders. Ports and airports need facilities for testing and quarantine, and safe connections. “We have the standard operating procedure ready to act on,” says Bjorn Hojgaard of Anglo-Eastern. “We just need help from regulators.”

The industry hopes that governments will be prodded into action by the sudden expiry of so many seamen’s contracts. The International Transport Workers’ Federation ( ) says it will support any seamen who refuse to work. If that leaves too few people to operate a ship safely, its insurance policy could lapse, and full liability fall on the captain and owner, who might then decide it was too risky to keep going. The trade that has flowed so smoothly throughout the pandemic might finally gum up. “Everyone is happy to reap the benefits of global trade,” says Stephen Cotton, the ’s general secretary. “But no one seems willing to step up when it comes to safeguarding those who deliver the things they need every day.” ■"|1
2020-06-16|"HEATHER QUINLAN and Adam McGovern, a couple from Parsipanny, New Jersey, intended to marry in October, amid family and friends. But as covid-19 outbreaks swept through America, that looked unrealistic. “We decided that, since we had no idea when the actual, traditional ceremony would take place, there was no time like the present,” says Ms Quinlan, a writer who, fittingly, has just finished a book about pandemics. Looking for alternatives, they settled on Zoom, the video-calling software that in lockdown has facilitated everything from work meetings to birthday parties. Mr McGovern contacted Parsippany’s mayor, Michael Soriano, who in turn spoke to New Jersey’s governor. He signed an executive order allowing civil marriages to happen remotely. The marriage license was then mailed back-and-forth to witnesses. The couple were married in their home on May 20th by Mr Soriano, dialling in from his office.

In normal times, weddings are big business. Worldwide, the industry is estimated to be worth $300bn a year. Each wedding feeds a constellation of businesses, from caterers and photographers to florists and entertainers. International “destination weddings”, as well as stag and hen parties, are a boon to the travel industry. Those in the wedding business often boast that it is “recession-proof”: people will always want to celebrate getting married. But it is not pandemic-proof. Couples have been forced to choose between delaying their nuptials and finding new ways to wed.

In some countries, disruption began before official restrictions were imposed. An estimated 80% of the world’s wedding gowns are made in China, and those made elsewhere are often reliant on Chinese fabrics and materials. In February, as China closed factories to try and curb coronavirus outbreaks, brides in America and Europe found themselves suddenly dress-less. By April, most nations had instituted lockdowns. Bans on people gathering put paid to conventional weddings: the average American nuptials are attended by 140 guests, according to The Knot, a wedding planning website.

For those set on a big day, the only option is to postpone. Katrina Otter, a planner of luxury weddings in Britain, says that almost all the couples on her books with spring or summer weddings have deferred them until 2021. This is hard on vendors and suppliers, many of whom are self-employed, but the most entrepreneurial have adapted: florists switch to deliveries of flowers and produce; photographers do socially-distanced family portraits; Ms Otter has been training other wedding planners.

Drought now may lead to deluge later. Ms Otter notes that demand for wedding dates next year has rocketed; many venues are already booked up from April to October. (More people may end up marrying on Sundays and weekday weddings.) In post-lockdown China, couples have rushed to wed. On May 20th, China’s own Valentine’s Day, more than 200,000 would-be-weds registered for marriage licences. In the eastern province of Anhui, registrations were up 47% from the same day last year.

Some couples won’t wait. Many of India’s 12m annual weddings are scheduled for astrologically auspicious dates. Plenty fall in the autumn but there is also a cluster in spring, especially in western India. In the state of Gujarat, a reported 30,000 weddings have already been postponed or cancelled. Those determined to keep their dates have begun getting married privately or by video. Shaadi.com, a popular online matchmaker, is running a “weddings from home” service which provides everything from a pandit (Hindu priest) to tutorials from make-up artists. Guests can join in: Anupam Mittal, Shaadi.com’s chief executive, recently participated in a ceremony with 300 online attendees, plus a livestream to thousands more. Such initiatives aid marrying couples but do little to help the informal labourers and vendors who rely on weddings for their livelihood.

Weddings have pivoted to the web elsewhere too. In April New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, issued an executive order, nicknamed “Project Cupid”, allowing couples to apply for marriage licences online from May 7th. (Previously, they had to turn up at the state’s marriage bureaus.) Annie Lawrence, a minister in New York City, is now conducting several Zoom weddings each week. She notes that many couples are motivated, both existentially and practically, by the pandemic. For some, being with the one they love suddenly feels more urgent; and even among romantics, the desire to share health insurance can be a factor. Project Cupid has proved so popular that no more marriage-licence appointments are available until September. Other states, including California and New Jersey, have adopted similar policies.

The speed at which “normal” weddings will resume will depend on how countries ease lockdown measures. Many European countries are beginning to relax the rules about how many people can congregate; Denmark plans to permit social gatherings of up to 500 over the next few months. Some Indian states now allow gatherings of 50 (though, in a country where guest lists can run into the thousands, this will hardly be business as usual). In America, Ohio will allow weddings and receptions of up to 300 people from June 1st, provided guests follow social-distancing guidelines. Weddings without dancing or mingling will not be quite the same.

Yet some may welcome forced simplicity. In Gaza, where the groom traditionally pays, weddings can be ruinously expensive. Thrifty men are reportedly using venue closures as an excuse for smaller, cheaper ceremonies. A Kenyan couple who wed in private, spending a fraction of their original budget, told the BBC that they have been inundated with calls from young people saying they had inspired them not to fall into debt over their weddings. Others may do well to heed their example, even when restrictions lift. One-fifth of the average Indian’s wealth is thought to go to “wedding services”, including matchmaking. In 2018 China’s ministry of civil affairs called for an end to costly weddings, which it said were incompatible with socialist values. In Latin America too, many couples go into debt to get hitched in style.

It is not clear when the global wedding industry will be up and running again. In the meantime, the act of marrying has proved itself adaptable. For her Zoom wedding, with her dress stuck in the shop for alterations, Ms Quinlan wore her mother’s bridal gown and ring. Mr McGovern borrowed his father-in-law’s class ring. During the ceremony, Mr Soriano read a familiar text from St Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians: “Love is patient, love is kind.” The passage continues: “Love...always hopes, always perseveres.”■

2020-06-16|"The magnitude of the COVID-induced economic downturn is forcing central banks around the world to rethink the set of monetary policy tools available to them. Many central banks have long shied away from negative interest rates, concerned about the impact on bank profits and financial stability. This column explores how negative interest rate policies can be used by central banks to signal a commitment to a prolonged period of monetary accommodation. Using a quantitative monetary model, it shows that the signalling channel of negative interest rates can result in a rise in banks’ net worth even if net interest margins shrink.

Negative interest rate policies have until now been off the table for many central banks. With the COVID-19 shock and its economic repercussions, however, central banks such as the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve are again putting these and other policies back on the table for discussion.

While the European Central Bank has pursued a negative interest rate policy since 2014, influential papers such as Eggertsson et al. (2017) and Brunnermeier and Koby (2018) have argued that negative interest rates can be counterproductive because of the bank lending channel of monetary policy. The story goes like this: The central bank pays negative interest rates on reserves, while the banks are unwilling (or unable) to pass these onto depositors. As a result, banks’ net interest margins are squeezed, and because of agency frictions in financial markets, there is a contraction in credit creation in the economy.

However, negative interest rates, like conventional monetary policy, work through many channels, including an expectations (or signalling) channel. For a central bank that has a preference for smoothing policy, a cut in policy rates today also signals lower policy rates tomorrow. In our recent paper (de Groot and Haas 2020), we study the signalling channel of negative interest rates and illustrate the conditions under which the expansionary signalling channel dominates the contractionary net interest margin channel.

The qualitative trade-off between the signalling channel and the net interest margin channel faced by an optimizing central bank can be captured in simple variant of the canonical New-Keynesian (NK) model. To do so, we make just two assumptions. First, policy rates can turn negative but household deposit rates cannot. This is a reasonable assumption given empirical evidence from the euro area. The second assumption is that, all else equal, this wedge between a negative policy rate and a zero deposit rate shifts down aggregate demand via a net interest margin-type channel.

The question, in this environment, is whether it is optimal for a central bank to ever set negative interest rates. We establish three results:

1. If the central bank can fully commit to future policy actions, then it has no need of negative rates as a policy tool. It can induce the necessary private sector expectations of the future path of (deposit) interest rates via ‘open mouth’ forward guidance, without resorting to a policy that imposes a cost on banks.

2. Even if the central bank has no ability to commit to future actions (often referred to as discretion or time-consistent policy), it won’t make use of negative rates. In this case, a negative policy rate provides no signal about its future actions and only imposes a cost on the banking system.

So far, the case for negative interest rate policies seems rather bleak. However, these results capture two extreme scenarios. While both are useful benchmarks, neither is likely to be a good description of monetary policy in practice. Our third result builds on work by Woodford (2003) and Nakata and Schmidt (2019) on monetary policy delegation:

3. For a central bank that cannot commit, it is welfare improving to delegate monetary policy to a central banker with a preference for smoothing policy. This policymaker may find it optimal to set a negative interest rate since its preference for smoothing results in an expansionary signalling effect on the future path of interest rates.

Figure 1 illustrates this result. The parameter φ captures the strength of the net interest margin channel. Consider the black line when the signalling channel is weak (i.e. the preference for smoothing in the policymaker’s objective is low) relative to the effect of a squeeze on net interest margins. In this case, the optimal policy (given by the reserve rate), does not turn negative. Consider next the red-dash line when the signalling channel is relatively stronger. In this case, optimal policy prescribes a negative policy rate. While the negative rate does not lower deposit rates on impact since they are constrained by the Zero Lower Bound (ZLB), the signalling channel lowers the future expected path of the deposit rate, boosting aggregate demand today and mitigating some of the fall in output and inflation.

Since Figure 1 is based on a variant of the canonical NK model, it only provides a qualitative insight into the monetary policy trade-off. In the other half of de Groot and Haas (2020), we employ a carefully calibrated medium-scale DSGE model that quantifies the magnitude of the two channels. A key feature of this model is the banking system, which we discuss in more detail below. We also replace the optimal policymaker with an inertial Taylor-type rule.

Figure 2 highlights our baseline result from this quantitative exercise. In this exercise, we introduce a 25 basis point cut to the policy rate which moves it into negative territory, leaving the deposit rate constrained at zero. The policy in our baseline (black line) is expansionary with both output and inflation rising in response to the monetary policy cut. Output rises by eight basis points whereas inflation rises by a little over three basis points. These responses are around 40% of the effect of an interest rate cut in ‘normal times’. The figure decomposes the baseline response into the signalling and net interest margin channels. While the net interest margin channel (red-dash) causes a contraction in both output and inflation (consistent with Eggertsson et al. 2017, Brunnermeier and Koby 2018), the signalling channel (blue-dot) is expansionary and dominates.

Note: Impulse responses to a -25 basis point monetary policy shock at the ZLB. Inflation is annualized.

Figure 3 provides sensitivity analysis. It plots the effect on output of a -25 basis point monetary policy shock for different durations of the ZLB (x-axis); different Taylor rule inertia parameter values (left panel); and different levels of excess central bank reserves in the banking system (right panel). The baseline results correspond to a ZLB event of 4 quarters, a Taylor rule inertia parameter of 0.8 and a reserve-to-deposit ratio in the banking system of 0.2. The effect on output is scaled relative to an unconstrained monetary policy shock rather than in absolute terms, thus removing any “forward guidance puzzle” type effects from the analysis.

There are two takeaways from this figure. First, while under the baseline negative interest rates are expansionary, this is not always the case. If the Taylor rule exhibits less inertia or the economy is expected to remain at the ZLB for longer, the signalling channel is weakened, and negative interest rates may become contractionary. Second, when the quantity of reserves in the banking system is large, the net interest margin channel is stronger and negative interest rates are less effective. This is because negative interest rates act as a tax on banks’ reserve holdings, and when the banking system is awash with reserves (after QE), the tax base is commensurately large.

Note: The x-axis scales with the size of the negative aggregate demand shock that brings the economy to the zero lower bound (ZLB). The y-axis reports the absolute peak response of output to a -25 basis point monetary policy shock in period 1 relative the outcome of the unconstrained (UNC) scenario. The scaling relative to the unconstrained scenario ensures that the results are not a consequence of the ‘forward guidance puzzle’.

A key feature of the larger, quantitative model is the modelling of the banking sector, which closely follows Gertler and Karadi (2011). As such, it is net worth of the banking sector, rather than the net interest margin per se that is key to understanding the effect of negative interest rates.

Figure 4 decomposes the response of bank profits (the change in net worth) to negative interests into several components. Two things stand out: First, while a shrinking of net interest margin pushes down on net worth (yellow bars), irrespective of whether policy features inertia, the signalling channel can have a significant effect on banks’ balance sheets, especially in terms of asset valuations. When there is no inertia and no signalling (right panel), banks’ assets experience a capital loss (blue bars). In this case, bank net worth falls, lending rates and credit spreads rise, choking off investment demand. In contrast, with policy inertia and signalling, despite the contraction in net interest margins, banks’ net worth rises on impact, coming mainly from a capital gain in assets values. In this case, agency frictions in the banking sector ease, allowing lending rates to fall and supporting investment demand and further credit creation via a financial accelerator type mechanism.

Note: The red-dot line plot the impulse response of bank pro

fits to a -25 basis point monetary policy shock at the ZLB. Stacked bars decompose the impulse response for every period.

The current COVID-19 crisis will test central banks’ toolkits to the limit. Negative interest rate policies may help central banks signal their commitment to a prolonged period of monetary accommodation and thus be a beneficial additional policy tool that can be employed.

2020-06-16|"How we should deal with the lockdown learning loss in England’s schools

As policy attention in countries around Europe shifts to mitigating the longer-run impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, a central concern will be to prevent this one-off event from permanently blighting the life chances of the millions of children who missed weeks of school due to the lockdown. Focusing on the UK, this column suggests a way to repair some of the educational damage using small group tutoring, a method with widely proven effectiveness, at a modest cost, and on a rapid but feasible timescale.

Around Europe, it seems that the immediate public health crisis is beginning to fade, although all are braced for a potential second wave of infection. The most intense policy attention needs to focus on mitigating the longer-run impacts of the pandemic. A central concern is to prevent this one-off event from permanently blighting the life chances of the millions of children who missed weeks of school due to the lockdown in the UK. Missed school means lost skills and reduced earnings potential.

Economic analysis suggests the cost of doing nothing is huge. At a personal level, this is manifested in lower earnings potential for the affected cohorts (Portes 2020, Jaime and Willén 2019). This will be reflected at the national level in lower skills: from the mid-2030s, and for the following 50 years, about a quarter of the labour force will have lower skills, implying a 50-year period of lower growth if we do nothing (Burgess and Sievertsen 2020, Hanushek and Woessman 2012). As well as a fall in income, all the evidence to date points to a widening of inequality. One among a number of very recent analyses, the EEF (2020) for example suggest that the attainment gap between poor and non-poor students might widen by 36%. The cumulating nature of skill formation (and skill loss) means that we need to tackle this now. In this column, I suggest a policy solution.

1. The policy intervention must come soon. The process through which skills are formed is dynamic – knowledge builds on knowledge, or as Heckman and colleagues put it, “skills beget skills” . If we do not attempt to catch up the lost learning quickly, that loss will compound and essentially become untreatable. The skill complementarity over time means that if we invest in a 10 year-old today, it will cost less than if we invest when that child is 15 years old to get to the same outcome at age 16.

2. Over the period of lost schooling, schools have provided online resources to children to continue learning at home. There is already evidence (Andrew et al. 2020, Bol 2020) that this has not been very successful, with many families reporting little learning has taken place. So, despite the cost temptation to try to simply catch-up lost skills at home, this will not work. This implies the policy intervention must be school-based, not home-based.

3. It also has to be something new, something extra, and something temporary. This differs from the usual policy question of simply ‘making schools better’. The quest for those policies should go on, but the current situation requires something much more immediate, and immediately effective.

4. While of course it is not true to say that the cost does not matter, we must anticipate that a policy intervention at such scale will not be cheap. Skills have been lost that were to be taught over a 12-week period. Replacing that necessarily takes time, and resource. However, it is clear that the cost to individuals affected and to the UK of doing nothing is dramatically higher.

5. Finally, we must use an intervention that already has substantial causal evidence supporting its effectiveness. This is by no means a trivial requirement. For example, the hundred-plus randomised controlled trials funded by the Education Endowment Foundation show that, in fact, many much-hyped education policies have no effect.

The policy that best fits these criteria is small group tutoring, based in schools.

My proposal is an extensive but time-limited use of small group tutoring in as many of the school years as possible, to remediate the learning loss suffered by the missed months of schooling.

I proposed the use of small group tutoring earlier in this crisis, and here I provide details and cost estimates. Support for a very similar idea is also building in the US, following an earlier proposal from Robert Slavin, Director of the Center for Research and Reform in Education at Johns Hopkins University, and support from leading education economist Susan Dynarski.

Small group tutoring is a flexible approach, with several parameters varying the ‘dose’: the number of pupils per group, the amount of time per session, and the number of sessions. It is fair to say that not all of these dimensions have been fully explored by suitably well-designed experiments. There is robust evidence showing that one-to-one tutoring works, and we can build from there. While effectiveness declines the bigger the group, it seems there are only marginal falls in impact from two in the group to six in the group, and steeper falls thereafter.

Taking a ‘dose’ of the intervention to be half an hour a day, for each weekday, for 12 weeks, there is good evidence that this has an impressive effect on learning. The EEF evidence toolkit estimates that such a ‘dose’ of small group tutoring typically yields an extra four months’ progress in school. Of course, these are all averages, but the rough equivalence between a gain of an extra four months’ progress from the intervention and a loss of three months’ schooling from the lockdown seems appropriate. A thorough and wide-ranging meta-analysis of effective educational interventions with robust evidence in the US (Fryer 2016) also concludes that interventions that “implement ‘high-dosage’ tutoring tend to demonstrate large effects” (p. 6), reporting very high pooled impacts from 0.78 to 1.58 standard deviations.

It is not possible here to set out how it would all work. But in Burgess (2020) I have provided some ideas on what some of the main features might look like, including who the tutors would be, the timeline, the selection of pupils, and so on.

Most of the cost of this scheme is the time of the tutor. The extra tuition would take place in the pupil’s usual school, after school, and while this would likely generate additional costs, these would be relatively minor. The EEF have estimated a cost for small group tutoring: for the dose noted above, they estimate a cost of £700 by adding up the time and taking it relative to the annual workload of a regular teacher. This is clearly subject to a number of uncertainties, not least how the different groups are bundled up into jobs, and the level of training of the tutor (discussed below).

Table 1 presents some rough estimates of what the overall cost might be.

They key parameters to be chosen are:
• First, what fraction of a cohort would be involved? I have chosen here 40% since we know from the accumulating evidence that not many families and pupils made a success of home learning.
• Second, group size obviously has a clear and straightforward impact on costs and a much vaguer effect on learning; I have chosen five in the example.
• Third, we need to decide which cohorts to include, within schooling up to year 11. Ideally, all cohorts would be helped, but for this example I have chosen six: years 1, 2 and 3 in primary schools and years 7, 10 and 11 in secondary schools. For the cost per group, I have taken the EEF figure of £700 per group per ‘dose’.

The total is £222 million. This figure is very modest – less than 1% of the overall schools’ budget. It suggests that the possibility of involving all the cohorts should be considered, raising the cost to around £410 million.

There are other ways of approaching this, also with merit, but I believe that this proposal has the greatest likelihood of success; I briefly discuss those in Burgess (2020).

Younger generations will pay a heavy price for our response to this virus. In this column, I suggest a way to repair some of the educational damage using small group tutoring, a method with widely proven effectiveness (four months extra learning), at a modest cost (less than 1% of the schools budget), and on a rapid but feasible timescale (start in October, finish by Easter). Many details would need to be decided, but the bones are here to make a start.

2020-06-16|"The Australian dollar rallied overnight having slipped back below 0.68 US cents throughout the domestic session. Risk assets suffered early as investors grappled with reports out of the US and Beijing citing new coronavirus hotspots. In the US 20 states recorded an increase in the spread of Covid-19 cases while Beijing reported a string of new cases after almost 2 months without new infections. The news served as a stark reminder of the risks of opening to quickly and forced markets to check expectations for H2 economic activity. Further downward pressure came following rumours China is considering targeting Iron Ore as diplomatic tensions increase. China’s dependence on the raw material has meant it was considered free from heightened diplomatic hostilities, however if China’s program of restrictions and tariffs does extend to Iron Ore the Australian Economy almost certainly suffer more than China. Having slipped to intraday lows at 0.6780 risk assets found support overnight as the FED announced it will begin buying individual corporate bonds, increasing the scope and scale of its bond buying program. With additional cash set to be in play markets bought the dip and pushed the AUD back through 0.69 to intraday highs at 0.6920.

Attentions today remain squarely affixed to risk. Investors will be keenly attuned to the RBA minutes for any guidance on monetary policy. A sustained risk on move could help the AUD edged back toward 0.70, while a shift in sentiment will likely prompt a move back below 0.69 US cents.

The risk on move overnight saw haven assets close the day lower as investors jumped back into to risk and growth correlated currencies. The USD was the weakest of the majors with the dollar index falling half a percent, while the JPY and CHF also shifted lower. The Dollar came under heavy selling pressure after the FED announced it would expand its bond buying program to include individual corporate bonds. The expansion of its monetary policy program emboldened investors to buy the dip and jump back into risk correlated assets as the availability of cash and central bank funding will seemingly continue through the medium term.

With little of note on the macroeconomic docket today attentions will remain with the broader risk tone. The Bank of Japan’s monthly policy meeting will likely pass without incident while US retail sales are unlikely to tip the scales. The market continues to largely ignore backward looking fundamentals instead looking to sentiment and forward guidance as markers of future performance and signals guiding the speed of any economic recovery. That said a strong retail sales print could bolster risk appetite as consumer spending increases amid easing restrictions.

The UK claimant count will also provide a valuable insight into the health of the labour market. A front runner to official unemployment numbers it offers a sneak peak as to the trend of labour market performance. A print above 400,000 will add mounting pressure to the GBP as it continues to struggle with the coronavirus and opening up the broader economy.

2020-06-16|"Inequality and poverty effects of the lockdown in Europe

Enforced social distancing and lockdown measures to contain COVID-19 restrict economic activity, especially among workers in non-essential jobs who cannot ‘telework’. These have implications for inequality and poverty. This column analyses the capacity of individuals in 29 European countries to work under lockdown and the potential impact of a two-month lockdown on wages and inequality levels. There will be substantial and uneven wage losses across the board and poverty will rise. Inequality within countries will worsen, as it will between countries although to a lesser extent.

The economic impact of COVID-19 is dramatic. The global economy is expected to shrink by 3% this year. Asia will not have economic growth for the first time in 60 years, the US and European economies are projected to contract between 6% and 8% (International Monetary Fund 2020), and global job losses are estimated to be over 200 million (International Labour Organization 2020).

The economic effects of the pandemic, however, will not be equally distributed (Dorn et al. 2020, McKibbin and Fernando 2020) and are likely to have distributional implications (Furceri et al. 2020, Lustig and Mariscal 2020).

Our findings strongly support this statement (Palomino et al. 2020). We estimate that the burden of the pandemic will be disproportionately borne by low-wage earners which, in the absence of compensating policies, will significantly increase poverty and inequality across Europe.

The lockdown and partial closure of economic activities were crucial to stop the pandemic and save lives, but their economic effects are likely to diminish economic cohesion between and within European countries.

Teleworking and lockdown ability to work in Europe

Even without considering the subsequent effects that may occur on the demand side (del Rio-Chanona et al. 2020), the lockdown and social distancing imposed by governments to limit the spread of COVID-19 have direct asymmetric effects on the labour market: in principle, only the jobs that can be done from home (‘teleworkable’) are unimpeded by the lockdown. Some occupations like health services and food sales are considered essential, so workers are not affected by their capacity to work from home. Meanwhile, certain economic activities like hospitality are closed under a lockdown and working is not at all possible.

To measure the capability of each worker to keep active under the lockdown, we calculate a ‘lockdown working ability’ index of workers (see Palomino et al. 2020). This measure takes into account the level of teleworking for each occupation (Dingel and Neiman 2020) and whether the occupation is considered essential or closed.

As shown in Figure 1, the average lockdown working ability index varies significantly across European countries with the Netherlands (0.61) the best prepared and Bulgaria (0.37) the worst prepared.

In Table 1 we highlight that our index varies significantly not only by country but also by:
• Gender: Women are less affected by social distancing than men.
• Type of job: Temporary and part-time workers are in general worse-prepared than their permanent and full-time counterparts.
• Education: There is a strong positive relationship between the level of education and the capacity to work under a lockdown in all European countries.

Teleworking capability is strongly correlated with higher wages both across occupations and across average levels by country (r = 0.76). However, the correlation between the lockdown working ability index and the average annual salary in a country is positive but very small (0.06).

Once essential and closed occupations are taken into consideration, the changes in wage inequality caused by the lockdown are difficult to foresee based only on the average level of ability to work under lockdown, and one needs to look at how potential wage losses are distributed.

Because not all workers are able to perform their job at home and some activities are closed, there will be potential wage losses for a significant part of the labour force that cannot fully work during the lockdown.

To simulate these wage losses, we consider several possible scenarios. Here, we show the results for (i) two months of lockdown and (ii) two months of lockdown plus six additional months of de-escalation with only partial functioning of the closed activities (80% of capacity).

Although each European country may have followed slightly different lockdown and de-escalation strategies, we simulate the same scenarios for all countries to ensure that differences across countries are exclusively due to their productive structure.

After ordering workers by wage centiles, we represent the relative change in their wage in ‘lockdown incidence curves’ (Figure 2), which makes it easy to appreciate which part of the wage distribution (low, middle, high) suffers the largest relative wage losses.

For a lockdown of two months, wage losses are sizeable across the wage distribution but vary significantly with the centile, being above 10% (of the annual salary) at certain percentiles in some countries.

Figure 2 Lockdown incidence curves in Europe (two months of lockdown)

Notes: The four panels show lockdown incidence curves (wage distribution versus wage loss, two-month lockdown scenario) for different groups of countries with similar curves.

As noted above, there is no straightforward relationship between the average wage of a country and its distribution of wage losses. Thus, we observe that the distribution of wage losses is similar for Norway and Greece (panel b), and Ireland and Cyprus (panel c), despite the fact that these countries have significantly different average wages.

Changes in poverty and wage inequality

The lockdown increases poverty in all countries. First, we find a 10.0% mean loss rate (P) for poor workers − those below 60% of the median wage − for the average of European countries under a lockdown of two months. This mean loss rate for poor workers goes up to 22.5% when an additional 6-month period with partial functioning of closed activities is considered. The mean loss rates are also sizeable by country (Table 2).

Second, the proportion of poor workers (headcount index, H) increases significantly for all European countries. The average increase is 4.9 percentage points under two months of lockdown and 14.5 percentage points with an additional partial closure period of six months.

These values imply that − in the absence of counteracting government measures − the percentage of poor people in Europe may substantially increase, even if lockdown does not last long.

By country, under the two-month lockdown scenario, we find the highest increase in poverty in Croatia by the headcount index, and the smallest increase in Switzerland.

When comparing wage inequality after the lockdown with the baseline, we observe that inequality increases in all European countries (Table 2). The countries with the lowest increases in the Gini coefficient under a two-month lockdown are the Netherlands (2.2%), Norway (2.3%), France (2.3%), Switzerland (2.6%), and Germany (2.6%). On the other extreme of the spectrum, we find Cyprus (4.9%), Czechia (4.8%), Hungary (4.7%), Slovenia (4.7%), and Slovakia (4.6%).

With an additional six-month period during which closed activities are functioning at 80%, the countries with the lowest increases in the Gini coefficient are Denmark (9.5%), France (9.9%), the Netherlands (10.5%), the UK (10.8%), and Germany (10.9%). Countries with the highest increases are Slovakia (21.2%), Cyprus (20.0%), Hungary (19.6%), Czechia (16.0%), and Slovenia (15.9%).

Table 2 Poverty and inequality changes in Europe

Notes: P is the mean loss rate for the poor, H is the headcount index, and G is the Gini inequality index. CL is partial closure, while 2m refers to 2 months. ∆RG is the relative change in the Gini index.

Finally, wage inequality both within and between European countries increase under a two-month lockdown, but inequality of wages inside countries increases more (5.04%) than inequality between countries (2.44%). Countries’ average wages diverge with the lockdown, although the main change in wage inequality happens within (not between) European countries.

In sum, our analysis reveals that the lockdown and de-escalation periods will potentially increase poverty and inequality sizeably in all European countries, even without accounting for second-round effects. Given that early relaxation of containment measures could have devastating effects for the health of citizens, we advocate for public policies that alleviate the distributional consequences that the lockdown may otherwise have.

2020-06-17|"Recent academic discussions have sought to understand whether the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis and associated lockdown should be ascribed to demand or supply shocks. This debate is of some importance since the underlying shock can have significant implications for stabilisation policy. This column tries to answer these questions by using data on hours worked and wages to estimate labour demand and supply shocks for the aggregate economy and for different sectors through an econometric model. It finds that while labour supply shocks accounted for a larger share of the fall in hours, both shocks were important.

In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, governments and public health authorities around the world implemented confinement and mitigation measures such as social distancing. These measures effectively led to the controlled shutdown of entire sectors of the economy, especially those that supply economic activities and services involving high physical contact with other people, such as restaurants, hairdressers, airlines, etc. On one hand, authorities forced many such establishments to close and send their workers home (the so-called lockdowns). On the other hand, consumers themselves also reduced their consumption of these services, regardless of public health policy recommendations. Furthermore, as workers in some of these services lose their jobs and income, they also reduce their purchases of other goods and services. This, combined with uncertainty about the evolution of the pandemic, leads to a reduction in demand for goods and services across the board, affecting not just these locked down sectors (Gourinchas 2020).

For this reason, most economists would agree that the economic effects of the outbreak and mitigation measures combine aspects of so-called ‘supply’ and ‘demand’ shocks (Baldwin and Weder di Mauro 2020). A supply shock is something that reduces the economy’s ability to produce goods and services at given prices. Public health authorities and employers preventing service workers from doing their jobs can be thought of as a supply shock. A demand shock, on the other hand, is something that reduces consumers’ ability or willingness to purchases goods and services at given prices. People staying at home and not going to restaurants or movie theaters for fear of contagion is an example of a demand shock. Additionally, as service workers lose their jobs they may stop purchasing other goods such as cars or appliances, which can also be thought of as a demand shock in those specific sectors.

Conventional monetary and fiscal policy can be used to offset aggregate demand shocks, but other policies may be more appropriate to stabilise the economy after a supply shock. Understanding whether a shock is caused by supply or demand is therefore very important for the design and implementation of stabilisation policies. Due to the nature of this specific shock, it is not clear that the government wants to stimulate/stabilise activity in certain service sectors, as that could run counter to the objectives of public health policy. The government could, however, target policies (such as fiscal or credit policy) to sectors that are not part of the lockdown but are subject to aggregate shocks. This implies that it is not just important to understand whether this shock in the aggregate has to do with supply and demand, but it is also crucial to understand this at the sector level (Guerrieri et al. 2020).

In a recent paper (Brinca et al. 2020), we try to answer these questions by using data on hours worked and wages to estimate labour demand and supply shocks for the aggregate economy and for different sectors, using an econometric model. The basic assumptions we use for identifying supply and demand shocks are very simple: if we observe hours and wages (prices and quantities) moving in the same direction, we assign more probability to those movements being caused by a demand shock. On the other hand, if we observe hours and wages moving in opposite directions, we assign that to a supply shock.

Figure 1 plots the shock decomposition we estimate for March 2020, when the lockdown began, for the growth rate of hours worked. The sum of the red and blue bars is the percentage point change in the growth rate of hours worked relative to its historical average; the size of the red bar relative to the blue bar shows how important supply shocks were relative to demand shocks in that sector. The first ‘sector’ is total private employment, and our results show that two-thirds of the decline in hours were attributable to supply shocks. By far the most affected sector was leisure and hospitality, where the growth rate of hours worked fell by almost ten percentage points. Again, supply played a slightly larger role than demand. While most sectors experienced negative supply shocks, some sectors experienced positive demand shocks; for example, retail trade likely benefitted as people stopped going to restaurants and started buying more groceries and cooking at home. The information sector also benefitted, likely due to increased interest of firms by telework software and arrangements.

Figure 2 repeats the exercise for April 2020, the first full month of lockdown. The total effect on hours worked during this month was much larger across sectors, with total private employment falling by almost 17 percentage points. Again, for most sectors, two-thirds of the decrease seemed to be associated with supply. Also, during this month, the positive demand shocks in sectors such as retail and information vanished, or even reversed.

There are some potential caveats with our approach, ranging from potential nonlinearities caused by such large shocks (our model is linear), and composition effects driving the joint dynamics of hours and earnings. To address these, we take our estimated measures of shocks in April 2020 and compare them to a sectoral measure of how many jobs can be done at home (Dingel and Neiman 2020), something that should affect labour supply more than labour demand. We show that there is a stronger (positive) correlation between the April 2020 supply shocks and the fraction of jobs that can be done at home. We believe that this helps validate our methodology and decomposition.

All in all, our results seem to suggest that labour supply shocks accounted for a larger share of the fall in hours caused by the pandemic shock in the months of March and April, but that both shocks were important. In particular, there were significant demand shocks in sectors that should not be directly affected by the lockdown, such as manufacturing.

2020-06-17|"On 15 April 2020, WHO received information regarding a confirmed case of yellow fever in Magandi village, Tchibanga city in Nyanga Province of southern Gabon, 590 km from the capital, Libreville.

The case is an 83-year-old male with no known vaccination history for yellow fever. He had onset of symptoms on 30 January 2020 and presented to a health facility on 2 February 2020 with abdominal pain and jaundice. Between 2 February and 9 April, he consulted the Urban Health Centre in Tchibanga, the Christian Alliance Hospital in Bongolo and the University hospital in the capital Libreville where the case received anti-malarial treatment and remained hospitalized until his death on 9 April 2020. On 14 April 2020, the laboratory results received from the WHO Regional Reference Laboratory at the Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, confirmed yellow fever infection, by seroneutralisation test. The additional differential diagnostic tests performed were negative for dengue, West Nile fever, chikungunya, Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic fever, Zika and Rift Valley fever.

On 15 April 2020, a multi-disciplinary investigation was conducted in Tchibanga by the Ministry of Health (MoH) with technical support from WHO. According to the field investigation report, the case had no recent travel history prior to the onset of illness and no additional cases were found in the community despite extensive case finding activities.

The last cases of yellow fever in Gabon were detected in 2019. These two confirmed cases of yellow fever were in unvaccinated international workers in the health district of Mitzic, Woleu-Ntem Region.

The yellow fever vaccine was introduced into routine immunization in 2000. Yellow fever vaccination coverage in Gabon is reported to be suboptimal (less than 85%) (WHO/UNICEF estimates, 2018). The case is from Mongo health area, where vaccination coverage is 76% in 2020.
• An epidemiological investigation was conducted in the case’s village of residence.
• An entomological survey is being planned.

Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease that has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact in unvaccinated populations.

The detection of the confirmed case of yellow fever in Nyanga Province shows the possibility of spill-over of sylvatic yellow fever in endemic areas to unvaccinated people in a rural area even in the context of moderately high population immunity (70%). This highlights the importance of achieving and maintaining high population immunity in all high-risk areas for yellow fever.

There is currently a risk of disruption to routine immunization activities due to COVID-19 related impacts on the health system and a decreased demand for immunization due to physical distancing requirements or community reluctance. Disruption of immunization services, even for brief periods, will increase the numbers of susceptible people and the likelihood of outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases. As of 12 June 2020, there have been 3,463 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Gabon.

Gabon is a high priority country for the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemic (EYE) strategy. Vaccination is the primary intervention for the prevention and control of yellow fever. In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. WHO and partners will continue to support local authorities to implement these interventions to control the current outbreak.

WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travellers to Gabon, from nine months of age.

Yellow fever vaccination is safe, highly effective and provides life-long protection. In accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005), the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever extends to the life of the person vaccinated. A booster dose of yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry.

WHO has published guiding principles for immunization activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and has developed specific operational guidance for conducting mass vaccination campaigns in the COVID-19 context. The EYE Strategy will support rapid resumption of preventive yellow fever activities according to WHO guidance.

WHO encourages its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures, including vaccination. Travellers should also be made aware of yellow fever signs and symptoms and instructed to rapidly seek medical advice if experiencing signs and symptoms suggestive of yellow fever infection. Travellers returning to Gabon who may be infected with yellow fever may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present.

WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to Gabon on the basis of the information available on this outbreak.

The world’s most sensitive dark-matter experiment might have found a hint of the stuff — although the data it has collected so far could be a statistical fluctuation or a spurious signal. The data collected in 2017-18 by the underground XENON1T experiment have revealed an excess in the number of particles hitting its liquid xenon, with a relatively low energy. The finding suggests the possible existence of a hypothetical particle called the axion. “You cannot overstate the importance of the discovery, if this is real,” says particle physicist Adam Falkowski. But another possible explanation is the presence of radioactive impurities. An upgraded version of the detector called XENONnT could solve the riddle next year.

Even if a screening test is very accurate, if it is not 100% perfect then it will deliver some false positives and some false negatives. And the lower the infection rate, the more likely it is that a positive result is wrong. An imperfect antibody test for COVID-19, for example, could leave a lot of people thinking that they are possibly immune to the disease, when they have never even had it. Scientific American explains, with a very handy graphic, how this mind-bending fact arises.

In early April, the international response to the coronavirus pandemic slashed daily global carbon emissions from fossil fuels by roughly 17%. Now emissions are rebounding, with China almost back to pre-pandemic levels. The European Union is leading the way to a green recovery with a proposed US$826-billion recovery package aimed at expanding renewable-power generation, retrofitting old buildings and investing in cleaner fuels. Experts estimate that 2020’s global emissions will be down around 5% compared with last year’s — the biggest drop since the Second World War, but still not nearly enough.

In this Nature video, we test a home testing kit that is being sent out across the United Kingdom as part of the government’s testing programme for coronavirus antibodies. And we speak to public-health researcher Christina Atchinson about the REACT (real-time assessment of community transmission) study, run by Imperial College London. (Nature | 4 min video)

The masses of user data collected by technology companies are providing social scientists with tools to do studies they have been dreaming about for more than a century: from the psychology of morality, to how misinformation spreads, to the factors that make some artists more successful than others. The goldmine of information has produced controversies and raised privacy concerns. And part of the community is resisting the flood in “a power struggle within the social-science camp”, says analytical sociologist Marc Keuschnigg. “Who in the end succeeds will claim the label of the social sciences.”

Many of the drugs under scrutiny for fighting COVID-19 are anti-inflammatory agents. Researchers hope that these could keep in check the runaway immune responses — called cytokine storms — that seem to cause dangerous respiratory problems in some people. But a growing number of frontline critical-care physicians are advocating a more nuanced approach. They say the goal should be to nudge people towards a ‘Goldilocks’ level of immune activity: not so hot as to cause organ failure, and not so cold that the virus can run amok.

By failing to support their universities, countries are undermining their own plans to boost research, argues a Nature editorial. It calls for students and universities to be eligible for the same kinds of temporary emergency funding as other industries are asking for. In the meantime, senior academics need to speak up for staff on short-term contracts. And everyone should look out for students, who are the ‘guinea pigs’ for the new normal.

Mass violence and unjust laws have affected the productivity of African American inventors, found economist Lisa Cook when she analysed patents filed between 1870 and 1940. But Cook came away baffled when reviewers showed no understanding of the history of Black people in the United States, or how their experiences could be meaningful to other people. The experience revealed how economics’ lack of Black representation and disdain for research about racism is inhibiting the field."|0
2020-06-17|"Linda Djougang listened and learned how to pronounce Saoirse, Aoife, Caoimhe, Siobhán. She has a simple request. Say her name like she can say yours.

In Djougang’s essay, reacting to the murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement, the international prop and frontline nurse succinctly captures life as an immigrant growing up in 21st century Ireland.

The 24-year-old arrived from Cameroon on August 15th 2005.

“That day changed my life forever,” she writes. “I flew here by myself at the age of nine. Ireland was a completely different world. I had to grow up so much that day.”

Djougang, who joined her father’s family in north county Dublin, believes her “childhood was taken” by the change.

“Where I was raised [in Cameroon] our family are your neighbours! You can’t say you don’t have a family because your neighbours are your family, your neighbours are like your parents, like mom and dad. That’s how I was raised.

“I remember my first day in Ireland and I was asking my dad, ‘can we go and play with the neighbours?’ and my dad was like, ‘no, you can’t play with the neighbour, this is not Cameroon.’ It was really like, ‘this isn’t how life here works’.”

Now in the final year of her nursing degree, Djougang has been working in Tallaght Hospital on a ward that treats positive cases for Covid-19.

Her first experience of racist abuse happened while playing football with the boys in primary school.

“It’s really sad because I felt like I really wanted to respond back but I can’t because I will get in trouble. You can’t fight back because you already know that you’re different.

“When you open your eyes, you see that there is not enough diversity in everything that we do. Sometimes I feel uncomfortable because people will look at you, probably asking, ‘what is she doing here?’ And that’s hard. That is so hard. That’s why I tell people, ‘try and live in my shoes just for one day and see what it feels like being black, being different’.

“I have sat down on buses and someone asked me, ‘are you black? The colour of your skin is so dark!’ and I’m thinking, ‘are you ignorant or what?’ But you can’t talk. I just go on about my day.”

Djougang, whose words were published on the Leinster website alongside a piece by Ireland winger Adam Byrne, touches upon a repetitive theme when it comes to racism in Ireland: “If some people have put in their head that they are not racist then you’re putting it in your head that you don’t need to change or you’re refusing to consider it. This is a bigger issue than ourselves.

“George Floyd’s life shouldn’t have been taken for people to start talking. ‘This is not right’ – it hasn’t been right for generations.

“You either want to make a change or you just don’t. This thing will never go away. For centuries, my grandma, her grandma, and her grandma have relived it.”

Byrne is more hopeful racial equality can become a reality in his lifetime – stating his “experiences have been 99 percent positive” growing up in Kildare – and he believes “from America to Ireland, and worldwide” that some day there will be “no inherent bias.”

But Djougang keeps returning to a lack of willingness by Irish society to educate children about African culture.

“We are not born to be racist. We’re not born to harm others. But it’s the system that we live in that affects us. People say here they want to educate themselves but where do you even start?

“For example, my hair. People are like, ‘can we touch your hair? How come your hair is long today, how come it’s short?’ Because you don’t understand my culture. You don’t understand my hair texture. You’re not educated about me. But I know everything about your hair.”

Echoing the lyrics of Zambian-Irish rapper Denise Chaila’s new song (C.H.A.I.L.A), she concludes with a cutting observation about how white people refuse to learn how to say her name.

“I would try and pronounce your name right. Names, like Caoimhe, Saoirse, Aoife. I will pronounce your name right but please pronounce my name too. I go home and I practice your name. I don’t tell you that I’ll go home and practice your name, but God damn, I do it.

“Because I want to treat you the same way as I would like to be treated too. So when I go home I will write your name several times and pronounce it and come to you the next day and pronounce your name.

“Saoirse. Aoife. Caoimhe. Siobhan. Oh God, you better pronounce my name right too. But that has been a topic where I’m just like, ‘it’s fine’. I have to accept it. I don’t understand how people can pronounce ‘Djokovic’ and can’t pronounce ‘Djougang.’

“My simple name cannot be pronounced or written properly.”"|0
2020-06-17|"AUD/USD struggles to retain the rebound from earlier this week amid renewed cases of COVID-19 in China, Australia’s largest trading partner, and recent developments in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) warn of a larger correction in the exchange rate as the indicator falls back from overbought territory and offers a textbook sell signal.

AUD/USD pulls back from the weekly high (0.6977) after showing a limited reaction to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Minutes, but the update to Australia’s Employment report may influence the exchange rate as the economy is expected to shed 125K job in May.

At the same time, the jobless rate is projected to increase to 7.0% from 6.2% in April, which would mark the highest reading since 2002, and the ongoing slump in the labor market may drag on the Australian Dollar as it puts pressure on the RBA to further support the economy.

However, it remains to be seen if the data will influence the monetary policy outlook as RBA “members agreed that the Bank's policy package was working broadly as expected,” with the minutes from the June meeting revealing that the “Bank had purchased government bonds on only one occasion since the previous meeting.”

It seems as though the RBA has little intentions of implementing more non-standard measures as “it was possible that the downturn would be shallower than earlier expected,” and Governor Philip Lowe and Co. may continue to tame speculation for additional monetary support amid the success in keeping the yield for the 3-year Australian Government bonds around 25bp.

In turn, the RBA appears to be on track to carry out a wait-and-see approach throughout the remainder of the year as the central bank pledges to “not increase the cash rate target until progress is made towards full employment,” but the threat of a protracted recovery may force the central bank to further support the Australian economy as fiscal stimulus programs like the Jobkeeper Paymentis set to expire on September 27.

With that said, AUD/USDmay struggle to hold its ground ahead of the next RBA meeting on July 7 as the renewed cases of COVID-19 in China undermine the scope for a V-shape recovery in the Asia/Pacific region, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) warning of a larger correction in the exchange rate as the indicator falls back from overbought territory and offers a textbook sell signal.

2020-06-17|"In 2005, Hurricane Katrina drowned New Orleans, Louisiana, killing hundreds of people, destroying thousands of homes and ejecting more than 90,000 African American residents. Then-president George W. Bush called it “a tragedy that seems so blind and random”. Not so, as historian Andy Horowitz documents disturbingly; much of it was human-led. New Orleans has seen 92 hurricanes or tropical storms over 300 years, including one in 1915 that prompted the city’s expansion. Most housing built after 1915 flooded in 2005, unlike most built before.

Butterflies charm like no other insect. The “real butterfly effect”, argues journalist Wendy Williams in her enthusiastic portrayal, is “the joining together of countless people of many different nations” to protect this creature — including many scientists. In 1862, naturalist Henry Walter Bates came to the rescue of Charles Darwin’s recent, controversial On the Origin of Species. He showed that harmless Amazon butterflies mimic the colours of toxic species to protect themselves. “Deceptive dress”, said a delighted Darwin; “scam artists”, writes Williams.

From the 1940s, radiocarbon dating gradually transformed archaeology. Now, geographic information systems are transforming the past again, using technologies such as satellite imagery and 3D laser scanners. In his impassioned study written to change popular perceptions of archaeology, anthropological archaeologist and science-fiction lover Mark McCoy argues that treasure maps are giving way to maps for time travellers. “It is time”, he writes, “to say, ‘Goodbye, Dr. [Indiana] Jones. Hello, Doctor Who.’”

History has seen four waves of US higher-education institutions: colonial colleges; state-chartered colleges and universities of the early republic; land-grant colleges and universities established in the Civil War; and major research universities founded in the later nineteenth century. The “fifth wave” proposed (pre-COVID crash) by president of Arizona State University (ASU) Michael Crow and colleague William Dabars, with ASU as its prototype, aims to serve students currently excluded by background and parental income.

“Epidemics happen for a reason,” writes Ross Slotten, a gay man and family doctor in Chicago, Illinois, who treated people with AIDS in the 1980s and still works with some of the 40 million globally living with HIV. He singles out as causes: ease of international travel; increased promiscuity; rapid spread of other sexually transmitted infections; political failure to authorize funding early enough; and the disruption of traditional life by colonialism and civil wars. All resonate through his powerful, humane and stylish memoir."|1
2020-06-18|"Our meta-analysis showed that renal impairment in patients with COVID-19 is common. The manifestations of kidney damage are diverse, ranging from abnormal urine analysis, elevated sCr or BUN levels, to AKI and renal failure for which CRRT is required. Among these renal impairments, abnormal urine analysis is the most frequent. 57.2% patients have proteinuria, in which mild proteinuria (+) as well as moderate or severe proteinuria (++ to +++) account for 38.8% and 10.6%, respectively. Cheng’s study has found that compared with patients without proteinuria, patients with proteinuria+ and ++ to +++ had a 1.5-fold and fivefold increased risk of death, respectively, indicating that proteinuria is an independent risk factor for in-hospital death of COVID-19 patients [2], so more attention should be paid to urine analysis in clinical practice.

Another main kidney damage manifestation was elevated sCr and BUN levels with incidence rate of 9.6 and 13.7%, respectively. Elevated sCr and BUN levels may be due to chronic kidney disease or AKI. Cheng’s study showed that the baseline sCr was elevated in 15.5% COVID-19 patients on admission; patients with elevated baseline of sCr were more likely to develop AKI and more severe AKI. Meanwhile, elevated baseline sCr and BUN levels was an independent risk factor for hospital mortality [2]. Therefore, we should increase more awareness to COVID-19 patients who had elevated baseline sCr.

Our meta-analysis showed that the averaged incidence of AKI was 4.5%, ranging from 1.3 to 36.4% dependent on the different severity of the illness. The exact pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated AKI is unclear. Based on the results of our meta-analysis in combination with our frontline experience, we consider that the etiology of renal impairment is likely to be diverse and multifactorial. Besides the direct attack by the SARS-CoV-2, hypoxia and hypercoagulability also contribute to kidney damage.

It has been reported that in the kidney, angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) is highly expressed in the brush border of proximal tubular cells but not in glomerular endothelial and mesangial cells [29], which could explain the fact that the main feature of kidney injury is the damage of renal tubules. Zhong’s team in Guangzhou has also successfully isolated SARS-CoV-2 from the urine sample of an infected patient [30]. It also has been found in the kidney biopsy that SARS-CoV-2 antigens accumulated in kidney tubules in situ [31, 32]. These evidences supported the notion that SARS-CoV-2 can directly attack human kidney. In addition, COVID-19 patients exhibit obvious hypoxia symptoms and renal tubules are more susceptible to ischemia and hypoxia compared to glomeruli. Moreover, COVID-19 patients mainly showed hypercoagulant states with elevated levels of D-dimer, leading to the slow blood flow velocity in the capillaries around the renal tubules and increased risk of microthrombus formation as confirmed by autopsy results [33].

In contrast to the previous study showing that median time for the occurrence of AKI from symptom onset were 20 and 16 days in SARS and MERS patients, respectively [1], Cheng et al. have found that AKI developed 6 days after admission in most COVID-19 patients while only 2 days after admission in patients with elevated baseline of sCr [2]. Our meta-analysis also revealed that the incidence of AKI was more than fivefold higher in severe cases and non-survivors than that in non-severe cases and survivors. Since severe COVID-19 is commonly complicated with ARDS which has high demand for fluid management, optimizing fluid volume and maintaining hemodynamic stability are crucial to prevent the occurrence or progression of AKI. In addition, appropriate anticoagulant therapy might help to reduce the microthrombus formation and to alleviate renal injury.

Our meta-analysis also showed 15.6% non-survivors received CRRT, while 0.4% survivors needed CRRT, which indicated that COVID-19 patients complicated with AKI have a poor prognosis once CRRT is applied. As existing studies have not provided detailed information about survivors and non-survivors experiencing CRRT, further research is needed to determine whether early renal replacement therapy could improve the prognosis of COVID-19 patients complicated with AKI.

The number of studies included was limited in terms of sample size, data availability, and methodologic quality, as most of the patients were from China. It will be better to include more studies with a broad geographic scope, to get a more comprehensive understanding of acute renal impairment in COVID-19. In addition, more detailed patient information, particularly regarding the risk of AKI and the relationship of comorbidities with AKI, was not available in most studies at the time of analyses. Another limitation of this study is that some articles have provided median and interquartile ranges but not mean and standard deviation of the sCr and BUN values. The mean and standard deviation for those data has been estimated in this study based on the median and the interquartile range, which might lead to inaccuracy to some extent."|2
2020-06-18|"The COVID-19 Catastrophe: What’s Gone Wrong and How to Stop It Happening Again Richard Horton Polity (2020)

Since the coronavirus crisis began, Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of leading medical journal The Lancet, has been tearing across the British public sphere. Here he is on the BBC, the national broadcaster, there in the pages of The Guardian newspaper — taking the government to task for failures that have left the United Kingdom with the world’s second-highest per capita COVID-19 death toll so far (Belgium is top). Horton has never shied away from controversy (his journal published the retracted, fraudulent paper by Andrew Wakefield that alleged a non-existent link between vaccines with autism) or crusades (against the Iraq war and for political action on climate change). In coronavirus, he has found a cause that matches his energy: the Lancet journals are pumping out both the latest research and his pointed critiques of government policy; and last month, he reviewed a new book by the Slovenian Marxist philosopher Slavoj Žižek that imagines economic and social worlds after COVID-19.

Now Horton has a book of his own. The COVID-19 Catastrophe is a sort of history, diagnosis and prescription, in real time. It is wide ranging, querying the changing role of international cooperation and the fallout of austerity economics, and taking a deeper dive into China’s scientific and political response to the crisis than most Western media have offered. But the book returns again and again to the catastrophe in both the United Kingdom and the United States. It is haunted by the question: how did two of the richest, most powerful and most scientifically advanced countries in the world get it so wrong, and cause such ongoing pain for their citizens?

We were warned what to expect in the pandemic, shows health-care league table

The easy answer is in their leadership. Horton levels the accusation that US President Donald Trump is committing a “crime against humanity” for defunding the very World Health Organization that is trying to help the United States and others. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in Horton’s view, either lied or committed misconduct in telling the public that the government was well prepared for the pandemic. In fact, the UK government abandoned the world-standard advice to test, trace and isolate in March, with no explanation, then scrambled to ramp up testing in April, but repeatedly failed to meet its own targets, lagging weeks behind the rest of the world. A BBC investigation in April showed that the UK government failed to stockpile neccessary personal protective equipment for years before the crisis, and should have been aware that the National Health Service wasn’t adequately prepared.

Politicians are easy targets, though. Horton goes further, to suggest that although scientists in general have performed admirably, many of those advising the government directly contributed to what he calls “the greatest science policy failure for a generation”.

Again using the United Kingdom as an example, he suggests that researchers were insufficiently informed or understanding of the crisis unfolding in China, and were too insular to speak to Chinese scientists directly. The model for action at times seemed to be influenza, a drastic underestimation of the true threat of the new coronavirus. Worse, as the UK government’s response went off the rails in March, ostensibly independent scientists would “speak with one voice in support of government policy”, keeping up the facade that the country was doing well. In Horton’s view, this is a corruption of science policymaking at every level. Individuals failed in their responsibility to procure the best scientific advice, he contends; and the advisory regime was too close to — and in sync with — the political actors who were making decisions. “Advisors became the public relations wing of a government that had failed its people,” he concludes.

The situation deteriorated to the point that former UK chief government scientific adviser David King set up an alternative scientific-advice committee on 3 May to both be more transparent to the public and exercise the independence of mind and tongue that he felt the official committees had ceded. It is a move Horton approves. It’s not clear that the group has swayed government policy, but it has given the public and the media a stable and open source of scientific information.

Elsewhere, the book discusses places with less-egregious failures, such as Spain and France, and the rare successes, such as New Zealand, and Kerala in India. Horton is fond of a tight timeline, and after experiencing the past six months through the fragmented lenses of social media and short news reports, it is a minor, but not insignificant, relief just to have all these events collected in one place, in order.

We practised for a pandemic, but didn’t brace

Such synthesis is a bulwark, too, against the blizzard of misinformation — the ‘infodemic’ — that has blanketed the crisis. Horton rightly points out that it isn’t just quacks and conspiracy theorists promulgating false information. There is a chilling effort by governments as well. Examples include the United Kingdom’s bizarre recent assertions that it never pursued a ‘herd immunity’ strategy, despite both the prime minister and a scientific adviser discussing it in public, and the Chinese authorities’ gagging of physician Li Wenliang, who tried to raise the alarm at the very beginning of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.

The book is weakest where it discusses the future. This is unsurprising — no one knows how this calamity will end. Horton is of the camp that believes there is unlikely to be a return to normality. “Perhaps Covid-19 represents an impermeable boundary between one moment of our lives and another. We can never go back,” he writes. His recommendations for the future are largely admirable — a more-connected and conscientious public, a more-communitarian government, a more self-critical scientific elite. But there is little structure or path for getting there. I, too, want the United States to be a better global citizen, without a president such as Donald Trump. Sadly, I struggle to imagine how it will happen.

Like much of the scientific work produced during the pandemic, this book is a rushed product — not subject to the exacting standards of more normal times. But like the scientific work, it is vital and up to the minute. Early on, Horton paraphrases the mathematician and writer Adam Kucharski, saying “if you’ve seen one pandemic, you’ve seen … one pandemic.” What is imparted now won’t necessarily help us next time, and we’re still in the swell of this one. The events the book recounts are barely cold, and the powerful whom it critiques are still in power. It has lessons that are useful right now."|1
2020-06-18|"Resilience versus robustness in global value chains: Some policy implications

Some governments assert that global value chains create economic vulnerabilities in times of a pandemic. This column, taken from a recent Vox eBook, examines recent experiences and the risk-management literature. It concludes that it is a mistake to equate self-sufficiency with robustness – putting all the eggs in one basket is still not a good idea. It is also a mistake to focus on production location when the imperative is to radically scale up production of vital medical supplies. Importantly, international supply chains will be needed to produce the billions of doses of COVID-19 vaccine we will soon need to manufacture and distribute.

With the COVID-19 crisis, a new debate has emerged with respect to global value chains (GVCs), examining whether excessive globalisation of production has not created new economic vulnerabilities. For example, Beata Javorcik recently wrote in the Financial Times that “businesses will be forced to rethink their global value chains” and that “while just-in-time manufacturing may be the optimal way of producing a highly complex item such as a car, the disadvantages of a system that requires all of its elements to work like clockwork have now been exposed”.1 Even the World Economic Forum has recommended to “aggressively evaluate near-shore options to shorten supply chains and increase proximity to customers” as a response to COVID-19.2

This column first appeared in the Vox eBook COVID-19 and Trade Policy: Why Turning Inward Won’t Work, available to download here.

While some lessons will have to be drawn, and both firms and consumers are likely to make different choices after the crisis, it may be premature to call for the end of GVCs or to conclude that shorter supply chains would be less vulnerable. This chapter reviews the relevant management and business literature and highlights evidence to show that the relationship between GVCs and resilience or robustness in the supply of inputs is more complicated than it looks. Even in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, we see how efficient GVCs are in answering the most urgent needs of countries. Policies in the future should support business efforts to build more robust and resilient supply chains and not add to health and other dangers a policy risk built on misconceptions about GVCs.

The vulnerability of supply chains during COVID-19

What are we exactly talking about when speaking of risk? On the supply side, firms face risks such as plant fires, natural disasters, financial risks, political instability, cyber-attacks, quality issues with suppliers and delivery failures. On the demand side, those risks include reputation of products, new competitors, policies restricting market access, macroeconomic crisis, and exchange rate volatility.

COVID-19 is first and foremost a global health crisis and has impacted the production of firms in GVCs in several ways.
• Production was stopped or disrupted because firms were directly affected by the presence of the virus at production sites.

Whether it was a decision coming from the government or from the firm itself, either there was a need to stop producing or to maintain production with new rules guaranteeing the safety of employees (with an impact on production such as delays or reduced output). This type of risk is related to the production site and applies to all firms in the same location. However, firms that source inputs from different locations confront an additional risk - even if the virus does not affect the production site, they nevertheless need inputs originating from a potentially affected area.

This is a supply chain risk. For example, such risk materialised in the fourth week of January 2020 when China decided to lock down the city of Wuhan and start taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus to the rest of the country. Manufacturing companies in the rest of the world (unaware at this stage of the tsunami that was about to hit them) were quickly hit. Car manufacturer Hyundai halted all production in Korea on 7 February 2020 due to a shortage of components coming out of China. This type of contagion flowing through GVCs has also been observed with some natural disasters, such as the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in 2011, or the floods in Thailand that same year.

Within a matter of only a few weeks during February 2020, the virus spread rapidly to other regions, first to Europe and then to North America. Such was the speed of its spread that supply chains were hardly disrupted. It wasnít until 19 March that Ford stopped its production of cars in both North America and Europe. And there only four days separated Volkswagen closing its factories in Europe (17 March) and in the US (21 March).3 And whether domestic or not, suppliers of parts and components also closed their plants because they were affected by similar measures - not because their inputs could not be delivered; the contagion became more of a concussion (Baldwin 2020).

Transportation is also a source of risk. For those companies still producing during the lockdowns (and possibly for all companies once lockdowns are lifted and the virus is still present), the vulnerability of international supply chains will depend on whether international transportation networks are still operating and without significant increases in trade costs.
• While limiting trade in goods was not part of the health response (with the important exception of export bans and restrictions to trade for some key medical supplies and medicines), measures taken by governments limiting the movement of people or reinforcing border controls have, to some extent, led to the disruption in international trade.

Trade in services is directly impacted when it relies on the movement of consumers (e.g. tourism) or the movement of producers (e.g. many business services but also transport services).

Goods are moved across countries through services, and trade in goods is indirectly impacted by the measures affecting (those) services. This is especially the case for air freight, which has been relying on cargo holds in passenger planes and is favoured during the crisis to reduce the delivery time of key inputs and supplies. Quarantine measures for air or sea crews and additional sanitary controls related to COVID-19 (or measures to protect the people in charge of controls) are also delaying trade.

While domestic transport networks and logistics are also disrupted, there is an additional vulnerability for international freight and a risk specific to international production networks. However, it is difficult to assess the level of disruption to international trade currently. Most logistics firms report no strong impact on their operational capabilities with the exception of some air routes or specific destinations that may be more impacted by the virus.4 Volatility in freight rates has risen, but with falling demand, international trade costs are more likely to decrease than to increase.

All the above risks are on the supply side and were mainly the focus of most debates on the level of vulnerability in international supply chains. However, on the demand side, an even greater risk may be on the horizon – culminating in a profound worldwide economic crisis triggered by lockdowns and restrictions to movement of people (which also restrict consumers ability to consume).

Contagion through GVCs will again become a concern if regions lift these restrictions sequentially and if the economic impact, although profound, is more or less severe across different areas. The mechanisms, which were observed during the 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis via contagion through declining demand and amplification effects (Bems et al. 2009) will resurface. However, the COVID-19 crisis is of a different nature, with the recession likely to stem from services and domestic activities rather be associated than trade finance issues, as in 2008-2009. The macroeconomic implications are also different (Guerrieri et al. 2020).

No current evidence that complex supply chains are more impacted by COVID-19

Numerous statements have been made about complex value chains being more impacted during the COVID-19 crisis, possibly due to additional risks and costs related to international trade.5 However, the available evidence – while limited at this stage ñ does not support such a view. The most impacted industries are those relying on the movement of people, such as hotels and restaurants, or passenger transport. And for countries under a lockdown, the bulk of the impact is through the fall in domestic demand and not international tourists.

The most impacted industries are those relying on the movement of people, such as hotels and restaurants, or passenger transport. And for countries under a lockdown, the bulk of the impact is through the fall in domestic demand and not international tourists.

Figure 1 is based on World Bank estimates of the economic impact of COVID-19 made on Thailand (Maliszewska et al. 2020). This country is an interesting example due to its integration in manufacturing GVCs as well as tourism activities. For each sector, the decrease in output is the consequence of some level of under-utilisation of capital and labour, increase in international trade costs, and a decrease in any activities that involve proximity among people. As the pandemic is still ongoing, these figures are model predictions only and not observed data. They are plotted against the import intensity of production, which can be interpreted as an index of the level of fragmentation of production (Timmer et al. 2016). Data come from the OECD Trade in Value-Added (TiVA) database.

2020-06-18|"The Swedish policy response to Covid-19 is exceptional by international comparison. This column explains how the approach is decided by three articles in the Swedish constitution. The first guarantees the freedom of movement for Swedish citizens, ruling out nationwide lockdowns. The second establishes unique independence for public agencies, allowing them to design the policy response to the pandemic. The third grants exceptional powers to local government. In addition, the Swedish approach is fostered by strong trust in the government.

Covid-19 has triggered drastic policy measures in many countries, including lockdowns and severe restrictions on the freedom of movement of people. Sweden is one clear exception to this pattern: no nationwide mandatory lockdown has been enforced. Swedes are able to move freely within their country as well as across the Swedish border – although they are likely to be stopped from entering other countries.

True, there are restrictions concerning the maximum size of public gatherings. Restaurants that do not adhere to social distancing rules can be forced to shut down. High schools and universities have been closed while daycare facilities and elementary schools have remained open. Still, the public authorities rely essentially on recommendations and information concerning hand-washing, social distancing, self-isolation, travelling and working from home rather than on any legally binding measures.

The Swedish approach of keeping an open society during the pandemic has drawn immense international interest. Why is the policy response in Sweden so different? Many explanations for its exceptionalism have been presented. As a rule, the main reason for the Swedish policy response has not been brought out. It is dictated by the legislative framework, more precisely by the rules of the constitution concerning the freedom of personal movement and concerning the independence of public authorities and of local authorities.

A lively debate about the pros and cons of the Swedish approach has evolved in terms of public health outcomes. However, these consequences are not dealt with here. Instead, my focus is solely on the determinants of the Swedish policy response to Covid-19.

The economic consequences of the present pandemic are enormous. These are determined to a large extent by the measures taken by government authorities, which in turn depend on the incentives and restrictions facing policymakers. Thus, the institutional framework for the policymaking process is the key to understanding the whole Covid-19 story for Sweden.

The role of the constitution

Two paragraphs in the Swedish constitution dictate the character of the policy response. The first concerns personal freedom of movement and the second concerns the particular independence enjoyed by public agencies or authorities. In addition, the constitution gives extensive powers to local government in designing policy measures regarding public health issues, in this way limiting the role of the central government.

The Swedish government is not allowed to declare a state of emergency in peacetime. Thus, the main factor behind Swedish exceptionalism during the present pandemic is that the Swedish constitution prohibits the use of lockdowns as seen from Chapter 2, Article 8 in the Swedish constitution (Regeringsformen).

Everyone shall be protected in their relations with the public institutions against deprivations of personal liberty. All Swedish citizens shall also in other respects be guaranteed freedom of movement within the Realm and freedom to depart the Realm.

The above paragraph thus guarantees full freedom of movement for Swedish citizens within Sweden and across the Swedish border under peacetime conditions. The paragraph is not absolute. There are exceptions for example for prisoners and conscripts for military service, as stated in Chapter 2, Article 20-21 in Regeringsformen. Local restrictions on the movement of people can be adopted for health reasons. However, there is no exception for a contingency like a pandemic. Thus, these rules cannot be adopted for a full nationwide lockdown similar to those put in place in other countries.

The Regeringsform (Chapter 2, Article 24) allows the government to restrict the freedom of meeting and of demonstration due to an “epidemic”:

Freedom of assembly and freedom to demonstrate may be limited in the interests of preserving public order and public safety at a meeting or demonstration, or with regard to the circulation of traffic. These freedoms may otherwise be limited only with regard to the security of the Realm or in order to combat an epidemic.

The freedom of assembly has also been restricted by a ban of all public meetings with more than 50 participants as part of the government’s strategy to deal with Covid-19.

The constitution guarantees the independence of public agencies

Public agencies are independent from the government in their daily business according to the constitution. The tradition goes far back in history. A first step was taken in the Regeringsform of 1634 designing the structure of public agencies after the death of King Gustavus Adolphus II in the Thirty Years War while Crown Princess Christina was coming of age. A second step was the Regeringsform of 1720, following the death of Charles XII, restricting the power of the King and establishing independent public agencies.

Today, the Swedish system is based on administrative dualism, where the public agencies are set up outside the ministries of the central government. As stated by Nergelius (2018: 300), the independence of public agencies from the government “is unusual or even unique in an international perspective”.

As explained in the English introduction to the Regeringsform, the government

has no powers to intervene in an agency's decisions in specific matters relating to the application of the law or the due exercise of its authority. In many other countries, it is common for an individual minister to have the power to intervene directly through a decision in an agency's day-to-day operations. This possibility does not exist in Sweden, however. Collective Government decision-making and the ban on instructing agencies on individual matters are expressions of the prohibition of 'ministerial rule', as it is often called.

This approach reflects the wording of the constitution in Chapter 12, Article 2 of the Regeringsform:

No public authority, including the Riksdag, or decision-making body of any local authority, may determine how an administrative authority shall decide in a particular case relating to the exercise of public authority vis-à-vis an individual or a local authority, or relating to the application of law.

The constitution thus prevents interference by ministers of government in affairs that are assigned to various public authorities. Public agencies are given a status to some extent similar to the independence of the courts and of the Riksbank, the Swedish central bank. Still, the government appoints the heads of public agencies, determines their budgets and the legislation relevant for their tasks.

The Public Health Agency of Sweden (Folkhälsomyndigheten) is such a public authority, now in charge of framing and designing the policy response to the pandemic. It is run by experts in epidemiology, not by political appointees. The collaborative work of health economists and epidemiologists at the Swedish Public Health Agency has produced a response that considers the overall impact of its measures and recommendations.

To sum up, the constitution insulates the public authorities from direct political meddling to a much greater degree than in any other democracy, allowing experts to design the policy response. Although the government is not formally bound to follow the recommendations of public agencies, by tradition this is the case.

The constitution guarantees self-government at the local level

In addition, the Swedish constitution gives a strong role to local self-government. This tradition goes back to the late Middle Ages. The autonomy of the local authorities is anchored in Chapter 14 in Regeringsformen on local authorities.

Art. 2. The local authorities are responsible for local and regional matters of public interest on the principle of local self-government.

Self-government through the municipalities at the local level and the regions at the regional level actually covers the major share of the large Swedish public sector, including the healthcare sector and the care of the elderly. Thus, the power of the central government in these health-related areas is limited by the independence of the local authorities. This decentralised structure of 290 municipalities and 21 regions contributes to the exceptional Swedish response to the pandemic.

As the Swedish constitution prohibits the use of lockdowns and state of emergency as policy tools, the government has to rely primarily on information and recommendations to influence the behaviour of the public. The impact of this type of policy tools is closely related to the degree of trust in society.

The Swedish public holds a strong trust in public institutions, in government effectiveness and honesty, in the accountability of elected politicians, in the democratic process and in the rule of law. This can be seen from the Eurobarometer surveys covering all EU member states. Here the Swedish respondents display a high trust in their national government, while citizens in many EU member states hold considerably lower trust in their governments (as demonstrated in Figure 1).

Figure 1 Average trust in the national government across the EU from November 2013 to May 2019 (percentage of respondents who tend to trust the national government)

2020-06-18|"In general, integration, encompassing access to services, is a challenge for migrants in Brazil, which is also true in the case of Venezuelans. Even if Brazil can be regarded as having an avant-garde position on Venezuelans’ legal protection in the region; severe social vulnerability of this population is the norm. The scenario is complicated even further when considering the above mentioned reality of Roraima. This complex setting led to tensions between the national population and Venezuelans, with escalating xenophobia and discrimination. The situation could not be placated even with the presence of international organizations that tried to improve integration. The first sheltering initiatives were especially precarious and unhealthy. An already saturated health system was a continuous point of contention, as well as the lack of job opportunities.

As a response to this context, in 2018 the Brazilian government established Operação Acolhida – led by the Office of the Chief of Staff (of the Presidency) with a strong participation of the Army - focusing first on the ordering of the border, which led to the creation of sheltering spaces with more resources and more personnel, as well as collaboration with NGOs and international organizations. As a second step, Operação Acolhida initiated the interiorização of Venezuelans, meaning their redistribution into other Brazilian states, aiming to diminish the pressure in the border state. Operação Acolhida and its several actions has been considered a good practice, however it has not been able to eliminate social conflicts and xenophobia (even by the local government), which can have disastrous results in light of COVID-19.

Besides these aspects, one also notices bad practices in terms of borders, protection of vulnerable groups, government responses and overall attitude towards COVID-19."|0

2020-06-18|"SSE Enterprise Telecoms, one of the UK’s leading connectivity providers, today announces its role in working with long term partner NYnet to support infrastructure development of an NHS Extended Access Hub in North Shields, Tyne and Wear in the North East of England. The hub was established to help medical staff support COVID-19 patients that required treatment in a secure facility but were not deemed as needing urgent hospital care.

 

 In order to successfully set up the new site, robust, resilient and above all reliable connectivity was required. It was agreed that Ethernet would be the best solution to facilitate the needs and requirements of the on-site medical professionals. Ethernet provides a reliable and stable service whilst also enabling the provision of high bandwidth speeds to support on-site systems & processes.

 

 Having worked with SSE Enterprise Telecoms for a number of years, NYnet contacted its provisioning team to acquire the technology, highlighting the importance of quick delivery of this service to support the COVID-19 response. A typical timeline for the sourcing and deployment of an Ethernet connection of this type, taking into account the need for third party collaboration and coordination, can take, on average, between 40 and 60 days. Given the critical importance of this particular project, SSE Enterprise Telecoms accelerated timings as much as possible.

 

 Thanks to the skill and effort of the front office team in manually working alongside industry partners, delivery of the circuit was completed in just eight working days. Once the circuit was deployed, NYnet was able to quickly install a router and connect the site to the Health & Social Care Network (HSCN).

 

 Simon Willmott, Sector Director for Service Provider at SSE Enterprise Telecoms said:

 “We are living in challenging times, where the reliance on our blue light services has never been so great. When NYnet reached out to us for Ethernet connectivity, we did everything in our power to work with providers across the industry to make the deployment of the project as quick and painless as possible.

 

 “The successful completion of this deployment has been a real team effort and is a testament to the commitment of businesses across the sector in coming together during the pandemic to make sure the lives of those on the front line, and their patients, are a little bit easier.”

 

 Zoe Oxley, Senior Project & Deployment Manager at NYnet said:

 “The Extended Access Hub is a critical component in the North East’s fight against COVID-19. As soon as the medical team reached out to us for connectivity support, we understood the importance of procuring and delivering a reliable connectivity solution as quickly as possible.”

 

 “Having worked with SSE Enterprise Telecoms on previous circuit deliveries we knew of the benefits of the LIVEQUOTE portal, but not even in our wildest dreams could we have predicted an eight-day turnaround from order to completion. This well managed, smooth process is a great display of how the industry can support our front-line key workers, should we all pull together.”"|2
2020-06-18|"T a lot going on in Britain in early March. London staged an England-Wales rugby match on March 7th, which the prime minister attended along with a crowd of 81,000; on March 11th Liverpool played Atletico Madrid, in front of a crowd of 52,000 fans, including 3,000 from Spain; 252,000 punters went to the Cheltenham Festival, one of the country’s poshest steeplechase meetings, which ended on March 13th.

As Britons were getting together to amuse themselves and infect each other, Europe was shutting down. Borders were closing, public gatherings being banned. Italy went into full lockdown on March 9th, Denmark on March 11th, Spain on March 14th and France on March 17th. Britain followed only on March 23rd.

Putting in place sweeping restrictions on everyday life was a difficult decision, fraught with uncertainty. Yet the delay is just one example of the government’s tardiness. Britain has been slow to increase testing, identify a contact-tracing app, stop visits to care homes, ban big public events, provide its health workers with personal protective equipment ( ), and require people to wear face coverings on public transport. As this wave of the disease ebbs, Britons are wondering how they came to have the highest overall death rate of any country in the rich world, and why leaving lockdown is proving so difficult.

The evidence so far suggests that the British government played a bad hand badly. The country was always going to struggle. The virus took off in London, an international hub. Britain has a high proportion of ethnic-minority people, who are especially vulnerable to the disease. And Britons are somewhat overweight, which exacerbates the impact of the infection.

Britain has got some things right. Its researchers have been in the forefront of the race to find drugs and create vaccines against the disease. On June 16th a trial by Oxford University, the first to identify a life-saving medicine, showed that a cheap steroid can reduce mortality among the sickest patients by a third. A swift reorganisation of the National Health Service put paid to fears that it would be overwhelmed. But the government has wasted the most precious commodity in a crisis: time. In a federal system, like America’s, the central government’s failings can be mitigated by state and local authorities. In a centralised system, they cannot.

Hindsight is a fine thing, and offers a clarity that is absent in the blizzard of events. Yet it is now plain that Britain’s scientists initially argued for the wrong approach: accepting that the disease would spread through the population, while protecting the vulnerable and the health service. Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, estimates that had Britain locked down a week earlier, at least half of the 50,000-or-so lives that have been lost would have been saved. This is more Britons than have died in any event since the second world war.

In retrospect, the government should have probed the scientists’ advice more deeply. Some of it was questionable. The received wisdom that people would tire of social distancing, and that shutting down early would mean loosening early too, was just a hunch. Even after the evidence changed, and it became clear the country was heading for catastrophe, the government was slow to impose the sort of lockdown seen across Europe.

Yet you do not need hindsight to identify other mistakes. Delays in fixing supply chains, promoting face coverings and increasing testing capacity were clearly errors at the time. Despite the urging of the country’s scientists and the World Health Organisation, by the middle of April Britain was still carrying out just 12,000 tests a day, compared with 44,000 in Italy and 51,000 in Germany. Because most testing was reserved for hospitals, care homes struggled to find out which of their residents and staff were infected. Competition for was fierce, so they also struggled to get the kit they needed to protect their workers.

The government is not solely to blame. The pandemic made new demands on the system. Some crucial bits of machinery did not work. The publicly owned company which supplies the health service with failed. Public Health England, which was responsible for testing and tracing, failed. But there was a failure of leadership, too. When systems break it is the government’s job to mend them; when the evidence argues for drastic measures ministers need to take them.

Britain is still living with the consequences. The spread of the virus and the devastation it has wrought have made leaving lockdown difficult, as shown by the halting return of pupils to school. Only five year-groups have gone back, many parents are choosing to keep their children at home, and the government has abandoned an earlier ambition to get more in. The “world-beating” contact-tracing system still lacks its app, which is not due to arrive until winter. Slow progress at suppressing the virus will have grave economic consequences, too.

These shortcomings have claimed many victims. Among them is public trust. Britain went into this crisis with a powerful sense of unity and goodwill towards the government. Now Britons think worse of their government’s performance during the crisis than do the citizens of any of 22 countries polled by YouGov, aside from Mexico. That reflects the government’s mistakes and its hypocrisy, after the prime minister’s main adviser broke its own rules about when to travel—and kept his job. While the world waits for a vaccine this lack of trust will make managing the disease a lot harder.

The painful conclusion is that Britain has the wrong sort of government for a pandemic—and, in Boris Johnson, the wrong sort of prime minister. Elected in December with the slogan of “Get Brexit Done”, he did not pay covid-19 enough attention. Ministers were chosen on ideological grounds; talented candidates with the wrong views were left out in the cold. Mr Johnson got the top job because he is a brilliant campaigner and a charismatic entertainer with whom the Conservative Party fell in love. Beating the coronavirus calls for attention to detail, consistency and implementation, but they are not his forte.

The pandemic has many lessons for the government, which the inevitable public inquiry will surely clarify. Here is one for voters: when choosing a person or party to vote for, do not underestimate the importance of ordinary, decent competence. ■"|1
2020-06-18|"The bank business model in the post-Covid-19 world

The Covid-19 pandemic has induced a deep global economic crisis. While so far banks have shown their resilience, partly thanks to major reforms after the crisis of 2007-2009, the crisis will put them under stress. Moreover, the traditional banking model was already being challenged pre-Covid by three trends: persistently low interest rates, enhanced regulation, and increased competition from shadow banks and digital entrants. This column introduces the second report in the Future of Banking series from the IESE Business School and CEPR, which provides a perspective on how the current crisis and these trends will shape the future of the banking sector.

The world is witnessing a large and synchronised economic crisis. Forecasts for 2020 suggest a drop in global GDP of 6% with a record number of countries growing at negative rates (OECD 2020). Advanced economies will suffer a much larger drop in GDP, of a size not seen since the Great Depression. No doubt, banks will come under stress as large-scale insolvencies among firms will arise and a wave of bankruptcies among households may follow. In addition, while banks entered the crisis better capitalised and more liquid, the size of the crisis will likely strain them to a degree exceeding that envisioned in many stress tests conducted so far (ECB 2020).

The crisis comes on top of the combination over the past decade of several trends that have meant increased competitive pressure on banks and that, in particular in some regions, have lowered their profitability. In the second report in CEPR/IESE series on The Future of Banking (Claessens et al. 2020), we argue that the global pandemic is likely to prolong, if not accelerate, many of these trends – digitalisation in particular. While the economic crisis has triggered policy responses to stimulate lending to the real economy while assuring the stability of the banking sector that provides breathing space in the short run, deep restructuring of many banking systems will be needed in the medium-term.

Download The Bank Business Model in the Post-Covid-19 World here.

We have now been living in a world of low interest rates and subdued growth rates for more than a decade. These persistently low rates have negatively affected bank profitability through reduced net interest margins and weakened monitoring incentives and lending standards, in particular for those institutions more reliant on maturity transformation and net interest income. In the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, we also witnessed over this period an increase in prudential requirements, regulatory scrutiny and compliance costs, as analysed in the first report in this series (Bolton et al. 2019). These policy steps have contributed to a more resilient banking sector, which is very beneficial in the current context. At the same time, however, the tighter rules have lessened banks’ competitiveness relative to shadow banks and added to a migration of some business activities away from the banking sector towards shadow banks. Moreover, stricter regulation has put pressure on banks’ profitability.

The Covid-19 crisis most likely means interest rates will remain low for much longer. Although in the short run banks are bound to benefit from being the channel of liquidity support and having access to central bank support, the deep crisis hitting the real economy is likely to bring a new surge in non-performing loans and could threaten banks’ solvency once again.

An additional development during the pre-Covid world was the massive application of digital technologies and the emergence of new competitors. While these have allowed for many new products and services and helped improve the efficiency of incumbent banks, they have also favoured the entry of new firms, increasing competition with traditional bank business models.

The impact of technology on bank business models has been profound (Vives 2019). Technological advances have affected payment systems, capital markets activities, credit extension and deposit collection. In the report, we analyse in detail the area where much activity is happening – namely, digital money and payments. For decades, banks have controlled digital forms of money and payments through regulatory protection of deposits, exclusive access to the central bank settlement system and close partnerships with credit card companies. The challenge today comes from a variety of digital assets that do not sit on the balance sheet of banks: cryptocurrencies, electronic wallets, stablecoins, or balances with a telecom provider. The competitive advantage of the new entrants is not based on the asset itself, but on the payment technology associated with it. The convenience of payments and the connections to other parts of the growing digital life of consumers and business alike, accelerated by the Covid crisis, has been the key to success. The dominance in payments of tech companies in China or mobile telecom providers in parts of Africa are examples of the extent of disruption.

Disruption from technology has happened in many other areas, not just payments. Entry in the different financial service segments has come from new types of providers: ‘FinTech’ and ‘BigTech’. FinTech providers of credit are more present when the country’s general development is higher and its banking system is less competitive, but less so when the country’s regulation is stricter. Non-bank entry is not yet meaningful in demand deposit-like taking activities, possible due to concerns about regulatory burdens. BigTech platforms, with their advanced technology and especially their (associated) greater access to (big) data, could make major inroads, but have not done so to date.

The entry of new players greatly affects banks through downward pressures on fees and prices and more compressed margins. Banks have responded, but many argue that they are far from adopting technology effectively themselves. As a result, their profitability comes further under threat.

The technological advances and new entry require regulatory responses. The technologies used by the new entrants can create new risks, including fresh consumer and investor protection issues, as the accumulating evidence on risk of discrimination associated with greater use of technology and big data shows. Since more entities now provide financial services and in new forms, it is also crucial to ensure a level playing field. A related important question is where to draw the regulatory ‘perimeter’, given that the overall industrial organisation of the various financial services markets is changing. The technology-induced changes also call for reassessments of competition and data policies.

In the short run, banks may enjoy a revitalisation as they continue lending to their customers during the crisis, notably as soft information can more valuable today than hard information. They also enjoy the protection of the safety net and access to deposit financing.

Nevertheless, Covid-19 will likely accelerate the digitalisation and the shift over the medium term of activities away from the sector. Medium-sized banks will likely be suffering the most since reaping cost efficiencies with large IT investments, crucial in a persistently low interest environment, will be out of reach. As a result, the banking sector will need deep restructuring; winding up banks and consolidating the remaining ones will be preferred. Whether in the post-Covid-19 world, political obstacles to cross-border mergers will prevent, as states become more protective of their national banking champions, is a major policy question.

BigTech companies have many of the ingredients to get ahead in the post-Covid world. They are digital natives; they have the technology, customer base and brand recognition, as well as vast amounts of data and deep pockets. Banking may thus move from the traditional oligopoly to a system with a few dominant platforms that control access to a fragmented customer base, with a few BigTech firms, together with some platform-transformed incumbents, monopolising the interface with customers. In this scenario, ensuring customer data ownership and portability for individuals, and data interoperability between platforms, will be key to keeping switching costs for customers low and the market sufficiently competitive.

Digital disruption poses a formidable challenge to regulators, which must adapt by balancing facilitating competition and allowing the benefits of innovation to pervade the system with protecting financial stability. In order to so, regulators must coordinate prudential regulation and competition policy so that compliance does not becomes a barrier to entry while at the same time entry does not becomes destabilising. Competition can be fostered by light regulation of the entrants, but at the potential cost of decreasing the profitability of incumbents and thus increasing their risk-taking incentives. In addition, this may mean the generation of systemic risks to non-bank entities.

The current crisis will test the resilience of the financial system and the regulatory reforms implemented after the global financial crisis of 2007-2009, which were examined in the first report from the Banking Initiative. In particular, it will stretch the limits of central bank intervention, and put to the test the incomplete Banking Union in the euro area.

2020-06-19|"The Australian dollar drifted lower through trade on Thursday following a larger than anticipated up tick in unemployment and a consolidated shift in risk demand. The Australian dollar fell to 0.6843 after labour market data showed the unemployment rate jumped to 7.1%, as almost 230,000 jobs were lost in May, a print well beyond conservative estimates. Alarmingly the upturn in unemployment came despite a reduction in the participation rate. With many Australian’s giving up the search for re-employment, unemployment statistics fail to capture the true scale of labour market turmoil. Having fallen below 63% the dip in the participation rate masks a much higher rate of unemployment. Had active participation in the workforce remained at January’s high (66.1%) then unemployment would sit nearer 11.5%. With labour market conditions continuing to worsen, yesterday’s print offers a stark reminder of the economic costs sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic. Having touched intraday lows, the AUD found some support in the promise of easing Chinese Monetary policy. The PBOC announced a 20-basis point cut to its reverse repo rate in a bid to stimulate the flow of credit and drive the Chinese recovery. The AUD crept back toward 0.69 before a shift in risk demand prompted another downward correction and push to safe haven assets. With the number of new infections across the US continuing to rise at an alarming rate and Beijing still battling its own outbreak, there is real concern a second wave of infections will derail any economic rebound through the short/medium term. Having slipped back below 0.6850, the AUD opens this morning buying 0.6847 US cents.

A modest risk-off mood prompted a broader push to safe haven currencies overnight, propping up the USD, JPY and CHF. Concerns surrounding an alarming uptick in new infections across the US and a second outbreak in Beijing have prompted investors to reassess expectations surrounding the pace and path of economic recovery. Texas, Arizona and North Carolina all reported a record number of coronavirus related hospitalisations on Wednesday as case numbers across the country continue to rise amid lifting social distancing restrictions. The US dollar edged higher as growth correlated currencies fell.

The Great British pound was the day’s big loser, falling over 1% in the wake of the Bank of England’s policy announcement. The MPC elected to leave the cash rate at 0.1% while confirming an uptick of 100billion pounds to its current QE program. The increase takes the total purchase facility to 745bn and means the program will now run into the end of the year. While the move was largely expected, many analysts were pushing for a larger increase in the asset purchase program. With normal drivers flipped on their head and increased monetary easing/stimulus driving currency gains, the disappointment forced sterling below 1.2450 to intraday lows at 1.2406.

Attentions today remain squarely affixed to the broader risk narrative, with the risk on – risk off environment creating ongoing short term volatility.

2020-06-19|"EA showed off a much longer look at Star Wars: Squadrons during its EA Play presentation, including our first look at gameplay. The dogfighting game looks to be a modernization of the classic X-Wing and TIE Fighter series. In an interview with GameSpot as part of our summer gaming celebration Play For All, creative director Ian Frazier suggested that inspiration runs deep, and shared more details on game balance and team composition.

For one thing, unlike the Rogue Squadron series, there is no option to switch to third-person view. You'll be engaging in all of your dogfights through the first-person cockpit view, in part for game balance. Frazier said that third-person would give players a competitive advantage over the limited field-of-view of first-person. But it goes a step further, to the point that you could turn off all the game HUD elements for full immersion.

""The whole game is designed from the ground up to be first-person all the way through,"" Frazier said. ""Now if you're in spectator mode, you're observing, there's a third-person perspective there. You are the pilot. All the diegetic information is built into the hud, so you could turn off all the game layer UI if you want and rely entirely on your instruments. We want that to be the core experience.""

That decision inevitably leads to a disparity in the types of craft. Star Wars fans know that X-Wing pilots occupy a clear wraparound cockpit window with a wide field of view, while TIE pilots have only a small circular window and two wide paneled wings that would block vision anyway. This, paired with the lack of shields on a TIE, would appear to give the New Republic ships a clear competitive advantage.

But Frazier says it's not that simple, and for the reason why he went back to the Lucasarts X-Wing and TIE Fighter games. He said when researching for the game, he looked at old competitive forums where players would ask how the TIE isn't strictly worse than the X-Wing.

""The answer then, in 1997, was you have a lot less stuff to deal with in an Imperial ship. And that is, in a sense, an advantage. I've actually found that to be shockingly true in our game,"" he said. ""The TIE Fighter doesn't have shields--which, you don't have shields, which is a downside, right? But that also means you don't have to manage shields. It's one less thing to manage, so there's less head-space required for that. … The counterbalance of what you're losing is what you're gaining in focus.""

As for how those head-to-head fights play out functionally, he also said that the studio has put some time into giving players more options. In a dogfighting game, it's easy to get caught in what he calls the ""death loop,"" where each ship is chasing each other until one of them gets shot down. To give more strategic improvisation, Squadrons lets you shift power to three core systems: lasers, engines, and shields. If you max out your engines you get to use a boost, and you can further iterate on that by doing a drift--cutting your engines to turn and then suddenly boosting, for more evasive maneuvers.

Finally, Frazier touched on how team composition and planning your loadouts can help complement each other for advanced strategies.

""It's not one person against the world, it's always a team of five,"" he said. ""Everything is built against that idea of a tight-knit squadron. In PvP it's not just what loadout are you taking, but what are your buddies taking? How can you get synergies between those things? So, okay, I've got the tractor beam that's going to hold them in place for a couple of seconds, she's got the Goliath missile that can kick the crap out of them but it doesn't track very well, and those two things in combination are really dangerous.""

2020-06-19|"Winning a mandate from their members to go into government is just the first hurdle facing the leaders of the three potential coalition parties. They will each have to raise their game by a considerable measure to have any chance of surviving the inevitable storms ahead.

Leo Varadkar had the bonus of being able to bask in the spectacularly good approval ratings revealed in the latest Irish Times/Ipsos MRBI poll, just as the coalition deal was being announced, but that raises the question as to why Fine Gael did so badly in the general election.

“I’m pleased for Leo that he is getting public recognition for his leadership in the Covid crisis but I’m angry that he has only shown his true abilities after the horse has bolted,” said one senior Fine Gael figure. “He picked the wrong date for the election, the preparations were appalling and the campaign was a disaster.”

By contrast, his handling of the Covid crisis was sure-footed and might even be described as inspiring. Once the seriousness of the threat became apparent he took decisive action and, more importantly, communicated the scale of the threat to the public and generated a mood of solidarity that was vital to make the lockdown successful.

That mood was summed up in a child’s poem about the lockdown read out on Lyric FM a few weeks ago which contained the lines: “And thank God we have Leo, not Boris or Trump”.

The question facing Varadkar now is how, back in government as tánaiste, he will be able to contribute to a similar level of public support for the difficult process of exiting the lockdown and coping with the cost.

Another if less important question is whether, in his new role as tánaiste, he will be able to sustain anything like the level of support shown for Fine Gael in the poll or whether in government the party will slide back to the dismal rating it achieved in the general election.

For Micheál Martin the conundrum is the opposite. He will finally achieve his ambition of becoming taoiseach but at a time when his party is sinking in the polls and the man he is replacing has managed to generate a record level of public trust. Establishing his authority as taoiseach will be his first priority and that will not be easy given the scale of the task ahead.

Martin will have to demonstrate leadership skills in office as that will be crucial to rebuilding the image of Fianna Fáil as a competent party of government. Maintaining a distinctive image will be a challenge but, after nine years in opposition, a spell in government offers the best opportunity to do that.

In the past Fianna Fáil’s great strength was its ability to bring people along with it while it was in government. That gave it the platform to win re-election on a regular basis. It is a political skill that always eluded Fine Gael and it will be a vital ingredient in making the three-party coalition a success.

For Eamon Ryan, the process of attempting to bring his party into government has been a daunting experience. After the February election it was widely assumed that, having led his party to a record 12 Dáil seats, he would be in a strong position to set its future direction.

Instead, as often happens in politics, great success can be every bit as dangerous as failure for a leader. Ryan has had to move very carefully in an effort to bring most of his new TDs with him along the path to government.

Some of them are clearly not enamoured with his leadership and regard him as every much part of the establishment as Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.

As if that wasn’t enough, he is also facing a leadership challenge from his deputy Catherine Martin and there is no guarantee that even if the members vote to go into coalition he will remain as leader. All of that adds a huge element of instability to the potential government and Ryan will have his work cut out to maintain control even if he survives the leadership challenge.

The ability of the coalition to govern effectively will depend on a high level of trust between the three party leaders. If Ryan is removed from the leadership it is difficult to see how cohesion will be maintained in the face of the difficult decisions ahead. Still, the likelihood must be that if a majority of Green party members endorse going into coalition they will stick by the leader who has brought them there.

As far as implementing a Green agenda goes, there was never a better time for the party to be in power. They have extracted serious commitments from the other two parties on climate change while the current moves by the EU to implement a green deal mean that there is an effective guarantee they will get a lot of their priorities implemented.

As they weigh up their options, Green members could do worse than ponder the wise saying of Indian Nobel literature prize winner Rabindranath Tagore. “You can’t cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water”."|1
2020-06-19|"The stock market and the economy: Insights from the COVID-19 crisis

During the COVID-19 pandemic and the related economic fallout, the response of the stock markets has raised concerns as well as questions. This column explores the surprising trends. There is some evidence that shareholders have favoured the less vulnerable firms, and that credit facilities and government guarantees, lower policy interest rates, and lockdown measures mitigated the decline in stock prices. However, fundamentals only explain a small part of the stock market variations at the country level. Overall, it is hard to deny that the links between stock prices and fundamentals have been loose at best.

On 08 June 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the COVID-19 pandemic was worsening around the globe and warned against complacency: “most people globally are still susceptible to infection. (...) More than six months into this pandemic, this is not the time for any country to take its foot off the pedal”. On the very same day, the US stock market began its fourth consecutive week of rally. The S&P 500 index is back to where it was at the beginning of 2020, erasing the historic plunge (one-third of its value) that took place between 20 February and 23 March 2020, as if nothing had ever happened. This is simply unprecedented, as illustrated in the figure below.

Figure 1 The US stock market in the time of COVID-19

Note: This figure compares the drop of the S&P 500 index during the dot-com crisis (which peaked on March 24, 2000), the subprime crisis (peaked on Oct. 9, 2007) and the COVID-19 crisis (peaked on Feb. 19, 2020). In March 2020, it took only one month for the S&P 500 to lose one-third of its value, while it took one year for the subprime crisis to decline the same amount, and one year and half for the dotcom bust. Authors’ computation.

Is anything strange about the stock market behaviour in the time of COVID-19? As the world suffered from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression (Baldwin and Weder di Mauro 2020a, 2020b, Bénassy-Quéré and Weder di Mauro 2020, Coibon et al. 2020), the reaction of stock markets raises serious concerns. Since the beginning of the crisis, stock prices seem to be running wild. They first ignored the pandemic, then panicked when Europe became its epicentre. Now, they are behaving as if the millions of people infected, the 400,000 deaths, and the containment of half the world’s population will have no economic impact after all.

In one of his influential New York Times columns, Paul Krugman (2020) said out loud what many people were thinking: “Whenever you consider the economic implications of stock prices, you want to remember three rules. First, the stock market is not the economy. Second, the stock market is not the economy. Third, the stock market is not the economy (…). The relationship between stock performance – largely driven by the oscillation between greed and fear – and real economic growth has always been somewhere between loose and nonexistent”. The no less famous Malkiel and Shiller (2020) have also discussed the seemingly odd behaviour of stock markets in the face of the pandemic. According to Malkiel, the alleged stock market irrationality is only “apparent”, and the COVID-19 crisis does not “impl[y] that markets are inefficient” inasmuch as there are no arbitrage opportunities, and stock markets remain hard to beat. Shiller is more nuanced: “Speculative prices may indeed statistically resemble a random walk, but they are not so tied to genuine information (…). The contagious stories about the coronavirus had their own internal dynamics only loosely related to the information about the actual truth”.

What new insights on stock markets behaviour can be drawn from the COVID-19 crisis? This debate is of special importance for financial economists, but also because the general public has a very negative view of the stock markets, which should not leave us unconcerned (Rajan 2015) – all the more so since the COVID-19 crisis put science and ‘experts’ to the test (Aksoy et al. 2020), without sparing economists.

There is a fast-growing body of research looking at the responses of stock markets to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is already giving some insights. While the dynamic of stock markets during the pandemic might look random, irrational, or even insane at first glance, on closer inspection they did not react blindly. Several studies have shown that stock markets were effective in discounting the most exposed companies: those who were more financially fragile, subject to the disruption of international value chains, vulnerable in terms of corporate social responsibility, or less resilient to social distancing (Alburque et al. 2020, Ding et al. 2020, Fahlenbrach et al. 2020, Pagano et al. 2020, Ramelli and Wagner 2020). Moreover, it seems that stock market losses are related to analyst forecast revisions, at least in the medium term (Landier and Thesmar 2020). In relation to these papers, we take a macroeconomic perspective. Indeed, the above-mentioned studies provide valuable information, but some questions remain open.

How have stock markets reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic? How do we explain differences in responses between countries? Are these differences in stock market response across countries related to macroeconomic or institutional characteristics, and if so, which ones? Are these differences due to the way governments have handled the pandemic? How have stock markets have reacted to lockdowns and economic policies implemented countrywide to ‘flatten’ the curve of infection and the curve of recession? (Gourinchas 2020)

In our recent paper (Capelle-Blancard and Desroziers 2020), we assess how stock markets have integrated public information about the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns. Although the COVID-19 shock has been global, not all countries have been impacted in the same way, and they have not reacted in the same way. We take advantage of this strong heterogeneity. We aim to explain the difference in stock markets response by the situation in each country before the crisis, as well as subsequent containment measures (social distancing and stay-at-home orders) and economic policies (fiscal and monetary) implemented during the crisis. We consider a panel of 74 countries from January to April 2020, which might be divided into four phases: Incubation, Outbreak, Fear, and Rebound. For each country, we collected daily data about stock index prices, the number of COVID-19 cumulative cases and deaths, global market sentiment and volatility, government measures taken in response to the outbreak, and various indicators of mobility (or lack thereof).

Three main findings about stock market reactions during the COVID-19 pandemic arise. First, after initially ignoring the pandemic (until 21 February 2020), stock markets reacted strongly to the increase in the number of infected people in each country (23 February to 20 March 2020), while volatility surged as concerns about the pandemic grew. However. following the intervention of central banks (23 March to 20 April 2020), shareholders no longer seemed troubled by news of the health crisis, and prices rebounded all around the world. Second, country-specific characteristics appear to have had, at best, little influence on stock market responses. Stock markets did not react more strongly in countries more susceptible to the pandemic, either due to structural economic fragility (for instance, indebted countries), or through exposure to transmission vectors (for instance, countries with ‘at-risk’ populations). Third, investors were sensitive to the number of COVID-19 cases in neighbouring (but mostly wealthy) countries. Fourth, credit facilities and government guarantees, lower policy interest rates, and lockdown measures mitigated the decline in stock prices.

In conclusion, do stock markets incorporate all available information? Actually, it transpires that we can see the glass as half-full or half-empty. On the one hand, the dynamic of stock markets during the COVID-19 pandemic is not completely accidental. In particular, our study suggests that it was not the situation of countries before the crisis that influenced the reaction of stock markets, but rather the health policies implemented during the crisis to limit the transmission of the virus and the macroeconomic policies aiming to support companies. On the other hand, fundamentals only explain a (very) small part of the stock market variations. Just like Krugman and Shiller have claimed, it is hard to deny that the link between stock prices and fundamentals have been anything other than loose.

2020-06-19|"My seven-year-old triplets — two girls and a boy — were having trouble doing classwork at home. The coronavirus pandemic meant that they did not have access to a classroom, with desks to sit down at. It is hard to study at the dining-room table with your siblings (their school, sensibly, tries to put them in separate classrooms so that they don’t distract each other) as dad gives the baby a bottle and e-mails his students. This was something we all had to get used to.

A more upsetting issue was my children’s anxiety concerning the virus and social distancing. This anxiety became clear when I returned from grocery-shopping one day to find one of my daughters crying uncontrollably because she was afraid I would not make it back alive. My other daughter had nightmares that my wife, a health-care worker, would get COVID-19 and give it to the baby. My son was afraid that we would run out of food and starve.

I was able to find a solution that helped with working and schooling from home. Taking a cue from a local science museum’s space-station simulator, we turned our guest bedroom into a spaceship-themed classroom. We decorated it to resemble the International Space Station and USS Enterprise. Each child had their own computer station on the ‘bridge’, and I had a standing workstation. We were able to embark on a learning experience using our imaginations.

However, the triplets’ anxiety endured. My son cried when, after the closure of schools, parks, museums and the library, he found out that the arcade at our local shopping mall was closed, too. I told my children that experts were telling everyone to engage in social distancing, and I showed them the COVID-19 prevention guidelines issued by the chief medical officer of the US Coast Guard. Rear admiral Dana Thomas is a highly qualified physician, and the consensus of the triplets was that we should therefore listen to her. I told my children about a paper I had published, about how expert opinion influences people’s attitudes towards climate change. We decided that we would do our own study about who people trust for information about COVID-19 prevention.

Although the study would be small, rushed and nowhere near the quality threshold for peer review, I saw it as an opportunity to teach my children about the scientific method, and to address their coronavirus anxiety head-on. We devised an experiment in which people would hear messages from four sources about preventing the spread of COVID-19. We decided that the sources would be a group of health-care workers, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, social media and a fictitious politician. For an educator such as myself, explaining the experimental set-up to seven-year-olds after years of teaching undergraduates was an eye-opening experience.

We collected data through an online survey. When it came to data analysis, I showed the triplets how the pictures used in their mathematics workbook from school are similar to charts and figures that are used in research. This provided a breakthrough in their understanding of some mathematical concepts. Then we used the data to work on representing groups of numbers such as tens and ones to look at in our sample. This helped my children to form a more concrete idea of large numbers, and made working on mathematics with them more enjoyable and less of an arduous task.

My children were not fond of having to sit down and do writing assignments, so I told them that even daddy has to do these. I wrote up our results as a paper that conformed to American Psychological Association style, and showed it to them. This made the kids more open to working on writing tasks.

Aside from the education they received at home, my children now show less anxiety about COVID-19, but they are still sad at missing friends. Although social distancing and working from home can derail many plans, it can also be an excellent opportunity to share your passion for science with your children. Turning my kids’ anxiety into curiosity was one of the most rewarding experiences I have had as a scientist. During this difficult time, we may have the opportunity to connect with our children in ways that inspire the next generation of scientists. And my triplets already have an idea for our next experiment.

Coronavirus and COVID-19: Keep up to date"|1
2020-06-19|"Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be speaking with you today.

Let me start by saying that never before in Europe have we seen such a level of interest about hydrogen as we have today. The reason is twofold: we need hydrogen to achieve climate-neutrality and we should use this opportunity to invest in the clean energy technologies, to restart the economy and promote innovation after the devastating economic effects of the COVID crisis.

This new Commission took office last December and since the beginning we have set our sights on a very clear goal – a climate neutral Europe within thirty years. This is the corner stone of our Green Deal strategy.

The first half of this year has definitely not gone to plan as we found ourselves combating the biggest health crisis in living memory.

Still, we are turning adversity into opportunity. We have published a Recovery Plan for Europe - the Next Generation EU - putting the green transformation at its heart. In this way, the Green Deal and the clean energy transition act as a new growth strategy. One that creates new investments and jobs for our people. One example is wind energy: over the last decade the cost of electricity generated by offshore wind fell by almost 30% and it is becoming more and more competitive compared to fossil fuel sources.

Our power sector is decarbonising rapidly and by 2030 almost 76% will come from low-carbon sources renewables (54.8%) and nuclear (21.1%). By 2050, our electricity supply is expected to be fully decarbonised with over 80% coming from renewables.

But electricity alone cannot get us there. We know that we will also need other carriers.

We also know that to keep energy costs in check, we must harness all the synergies and exploit the complementarities between the electricity sector, our vast gas infrastructure, our industry and the transport sector.

Hydrogen is a vital missing piece of the puzzle to help us reach this deeper decarbonisation and to reach it at a lower cost to people.

We have recognised this opportunity and are working on two key strategies to be launched on the 8th of July: a strategy for energy system integration and a dedicated strategy on hydrogen. They will set out how we intend to accelerate the transition to the energy system of the future. A system in which hydrogen will play a key role.

Today, we use hydrogen mostly in chemical processes. Tomorrow, hydrogen can decarbonise these industrial processes, it can be a new fuel for heavy-duty transport and clean jet fuel for aviation, or replace coal in steel-making.

To make this happen we need to focus our work in four areas.

First, we need to activate a virtuous circle of increased supply and demand for hydrogen, boosting demand in end uses, like industrial applications and transport, and investing in developing electrolysers with greater capacity. Part of this is bringing down the cost of clean hydrogen to make it competitive. For this, we need more and cheaper renewable energy, and an efficient electricity market.

We have laid the ground for this through the Clean Energy for all Europeans market design legislation which we are currently implementing.

But we will go even further to create an ecosystem approach to hydrogen production. To do this, we are creating a Clean Hydrogen Alliance to bring the full value chain of hydrogen together: investors, governmental, institutional and industrial partners. This template of an industrial alliance has proven its worth before in Europe. We aim to involve all actors upstream and downstream to accelerate hydrogen deployment and achieve cost reductions and greater competitiveness.

Second, we need a regulatory framework to shape an open and competitive market with unhindered cross border trade and infrastructures to transport hydrogen where it is needed. This could mean a need to repurpose or re-use some of our existing natural gas infrastructure and helps us to avoid stranded assets.

Third, we need to continue our research and innovation. Because developing a clean hydrogen economy poses a technological challenge.

We need to vastly scale up electrolyser technologies to support the ambition. But at this point, we still do not have the production capacity we need.

Demonstration projects are starting at 20 Mega Watts in Europe. But we need Giga Watt scale electrolysers. We also need research in fuel cells and storage. So in September we will adopt a Green Deal call of 950 million EUR under Horizon 2020, which will also cover hydrogen. Of that, more than one third will be dedicated to energy topics, including a call for a large-scale electrolyser. It is our hope that these will help us to gather the right minds and unleash their research and innovation in all the relevant areas across the hydrogen value chain.

And finally, we need international cooperation. The EU imports today just over 58% of the energy it needs. Tomorrow, we need to transform these imports of fossil fuels into clean energy partnerships. We want to work with our neighbours in the first place, but also with global partners. We need common understanding and possibly even the harmonisation of codes and standards for trading hydrogen internationally

I have seen our focus on hydrogen mirrored across the globe. The number of countries joining the International Hydrogen Council has more than quadrupled in the past three years.

And Director-General Matsuyama, I have seen that Japan has announced the next Olympic Games to be the “Hydrogen Olympics”. This is excellent!

Working side by side with our international partners is also a fundamental part of the research and innovation I mentioned earlier. This is why we are taking part in all major initiatives related to hydrogen, such as co-leading the Hydrogen Initiative of the Clean Energy Ministerial supported by the IEA. We are also involved in designing activities on hydrogen under Mission Innovation.

This is how we see the way forward – a strong approach on both an EU and an international level. This is how we scale up, exchange ideas and solidify the position of hydrogen in the energy sector.

I look forward to hearing your own views on hydrogen’s role in the energy system of tomorrow. And more about where we can work together further to shape that future."|2

2020-06-19|"Objective no. 1: To define the risk of thrombosis in patients with COVID-19

All COVID-19 patients should be screened for additional thromboembolic risk factors, especially active cancer (treatment within the last 6 months) and recent personal history (< 1 years) of thromboembolic events.

Other risk factors may be considered (age > 70 years, prolonged bed rest, postpartum, combined oral contraception).

To define the thrombotic risk level according to the following:

- The severity of COVID-19 according to the requirement of supplemental oxygen (O ) therapy, high-flow nasal oxygen therapy, positive airway pressure support, or mechanical ventilation.

Then, 4 different levels of thromboembolic risk can be determined: low, intermediate, high, and very high (Table 1).

It is suggested that the following hemostasis variables be monitored at least every 48 h: platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen, and D-dimer levels.

In severe cases, in the event of clinical worsening, thrombocytopenia and/or a decrease in fibrinogen concentration, it is proposed that the concentration of fibrin monomers (if assay available), factors II and V, and antithrombin levels should also be measured for the diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

It is proposed that the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies should be investigated for iterative thrombosis under heparin therapy at effective doses.

In all hospitalized patients, it is proposed to switch from oral anticoagulant therapy, vitamin K antagonist or direct oral anticoagulant (risk of instability and drug interactions), to curative heparin therapy.

In case of intermediate thrombotic risk (Fig. 1), it is proposed to prescribe prophylaxis with a LMWH at standard doses, e.g., enoxaparin 4000 IU/24 h SC, tinzaparin 3500 IU/24 h SC, or dalteparin 5000 IU/24 h SC. Fondaparinux 2.5 mg/24 h SC is an alternative if creatinine clearance (Clcr) is greater than 50 ml/min. In the presence of severe renal failure, an alternative to SC unfractionated heparin (UFH) can be proposed: enoxaparin 2000 IU/24 h SC for a Clcr between 15 and 30 ml/min or tinzaparin 3500 IU/24 h SC for a Clcr between 20 and 30 ml/min.

In patients treated with LMWH with standard prophylactic doses, it is recommended NOT to monitor anti-Xa activity.

In case of high thrombotic risk, it is proposed to prescribe an adjusted prophylaxis with intermediate doses of LMWH: enoxaparin 4000 IU/12 h SC or 6000 IU/12 h SC if weight > 120 kg. In case of renal insufficiency (Clcr < 30 ml/min), it is proposed to prescribe UFH at an initial dose of 200 IU/kg/24 h, IV.

In patients treated with LMWH doses higher than the standard prophylactic regimen, it is proposed to check anti-Xa activity 4 h after the 3rd injection, then regularly in case of renal insufficiency, to monitor for levels (variable threshold value according to LMWH) due to the potential increased risk of bleeding.

In case of very high thrombotic risk, it is proposed to prescribe therapeutic doses of LMWH, e.g., enoxaparin, 100 IU/kg/12 h SC, or in case of severe renal insufficiency of UFH, 500 IU/Kg/24 h, IV after a bolus of 5000 IU, and with dosage adjustment according to anti-Xa activity.

In obese patients (BMI > 30 kg/m2) with a high or very high thrombotic risk, the following heparin doses are proposed:
• None Enoxaparin 4000 IU/12 h or 6000 IU/12 h if weight > 120 kg in high-risk patients
• None Enoxaparin 100 IU/kg (actual weight)/12 h SC not to exceed 10,000 IU/12 h or UFH 500 IU/kg/24 h in very high-risk patients with additional thrombotic risk factor and high-flow nasal O therapy or artificial ventilation

In all patients treated with UFH, it is proposed to monitor the anti-Xa activity at least every 48 h and after each dose modification, to be maintained, if the risk of bleeding is controlled, between 0.3 and 0.5 IU/ml during reinforced prophylactic treatment (starting dose 200 IU/kg/24 h, IV) and between 0.5 and 0.7 IU/ml during therapeutic treatment (starting dose 500 IU/kg/24 h, IV, after an initial IV bolus of 5000 IU).

The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) exposes the patient to a very high risk of thrombosis. In this setting, we propose therapeutic anticoagulation with UFH as soon as ECMO is initiated (independently of the ECMO flow rate), with a target anti-Xa level between 0.5 and 0.7 IU/ml.

In case of an increased inflammatory syndrome (e.g., fibrinogen > 8 g/l or 800 mg/dl) and/or a rapid increase in D-dimer concentration to > 3 μg/ml (3000 ng/ml), it is suggested that the administration of therapeutic doses of heparin be considered even in the absence of clinical thrombosis, taking into account the risk of hemorrhage.

For UFH, it is recommended that platelet count should be monitored at least every 48 h. A decrease in the platelet count by more than 40% between the 4th and 14th day of treatment requires a DIC assessment and a screening for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

In the event of multiorgan failure, or a consumptive coagulopathy with decrease in fibrinogen concentration, platelet count, and factor V level, it is proposed that the dosage of heparin therapy be reassessed, as these events are associated with an increased risk of bleeding.

It is proposed that the intensity and duration of thromboprophylaxis be re-evaluated according to the severity of the infection and the evolution of the resulting risk factors.

Objective no. 4: Apply additional measures for optimal management of thrombotic risk

Discontinuation of hormonal or hormone-related therapy (estrogen-progestin contraception, hormone replacement therapy, tamoxifen) is recommended in patients with COVID-19 requiring thromboprophylaxis.

It is proposed to implement a specific communication pathway between the clinical units and the hemostasis laboratory, for optimal transmission of biological results (in particular, platelet count, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and anti-Xa activity) for rapid adaptation of heparin therapy.

It is suggested that pulmonary embolism be investigated in any patient with sudden respiratory or hemodynamic deterioration, especially in the case of right ventricular dysfunction.

A proximal vein compression ultrasonography with Doppler of the common femoral and popliteal veins is proposed in the event of any unexplained clinical worsening, or in the case of a sudden increase in D-dimer levels.

This examination may also be performed earlier in patients with a central venous catheter, especially in case of dysfunction or obstruction.

The insertion of a vena cava filter is not warranted in these patients at low risk for bleeding.

Intermittent pneumatic compression is an option to be considered if available in patients at a high risk of bleeding."|0

2020-06-19|"Warren Gatland has made a last plea to Premiership Rugby to reschedule its final next season as part of the global calendar negotiations to give the British and Irish Lions adequate preparation time ahead of their tour of South Africa.

Next year's Premiership final is scheduled for June 26, just seven days before the Lions' first fixture, against the Western Stormers in Cape Town.

Chiefs coach Gatland, who will take charge of his third Lions tour, has revealed that a similar lack of preparation time ahead of the tour to New Zealand in 2017 led to him raising concerns with the management about the risk of legal action if a player was injured as a consequence.

With talks continuing between the unions and clubs over proposals to restructure the global season, which could mean the Lions tour switching from July to September, and club rugby played through the summer months, Gatland insisted all parties had a duty to deliver on a commitment to improve player welfare.

 * Warren Gatland appointed British and Irish Lions head coach for South Africa in 2021



""It has been a little bit frustrating with the Premiership not moving their final,"" Gatland said. ""That may change with the reintroduction of the season. We will have to wait and see. The ideal situation would have been to have a full week together in the UK, play a warm-up game and get on the plane the following day and head to South Africa.

""I don't think assembling a squad for two weeks before you play your first game in South Africa is too much of an unreasonable request. Last time, in New Zealand, we left on the Monday, had two days' travel and arrived on the Wednesday.

''The players were jet-lagged and had to play the first game on the Saturday. I did point that out to the powers-that-be and the Lions and said we were potentially opening ourselves up [to legal action]. I said if a player got a career-ending injury in the first game, I think he had potentially got a legitimate claim to say that the preparation wasn't adequate or he didn't have enough time from arriving in New Zealand before he was made to play his first game.

""Those are things we have got to be careful about. Everyone talks about player welfare, and it is one of the criteria in looking at seasons and planning and preparation. We have got to deliver that.""

Gatland is urging the Premiership to reconsider and bring its final forward by a week, as the Pro14 has already committed to, and -insists the clubs would benefit directly from giving the Lions the best chance of success.

""The Pro14 did it and I wasn't quite sure why the Premiership weren't prepared to do the same,"" he added. ""I am not sure why there doesn't seem to be the appetite to be really positive and try to work together in terms of helping the Lions.

""If the players go away on the Lions and win a series, it creates so much -interest from new supporters who probably don't follow clubs. You have got this -potential to create superstars as household names and legends. To me, if that happens to a club, you can use that and promote that and it benefits everyone. I would like to see a little bit more cooperation but that is something we are continually battling with and I will keep banging away.""

Gatland insists the Lions, too, are prepared to be flexible on the scheduling of their tour if switching it to a September start is key to reaching agreement on the global calendar talks, which centre on moving the July test window to October.

""Probably the ideal scenario for us is that we would like to stay in the time-frame where it is at the moment, but if it means having to move -because it is a positive for everyone, I think we are prepared to do that,"" Gatland added.

""There is no doubt the southern hemisphere recognises how important the Lions tour is to their calendar every four years, it creates a lot of stimulus financially not only for the home -unions but also the host country and creates a huge amount of interest from the fans.""

The uncertainty in the scheduling is proving a challenge in his plans for the tour. A recce trip to South Africa next month has been postponed, while recruitment of his backroom staff and coaching team has been put on hold because of the Covid-19 lockdown.

As head coach of the Chiefs, Gatland is due to return to the UK at the end of August, following the end of the -Super Rugby campaign.

He says he intends to speak to the chief executives of the four home -unions ahead of appointing his staff to -ensure that there is no repeat of his frustrations four years ago, when several candidates became unavailable, including the current Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend.

""I have some approaches from individuals and from agents about people, as I did last time,"" he added.

""I was interested in a few people, had spoken to one or two and then for whatever reason, people then became unavailable. It was a bit frustrating. The important thing now is that I have changed the process. I want to get around all the chief -executives of the four home unions and talk to them. I will ask which of their staff are potentially not available so that we don't end up with that same situation going forward.

""I have found working with the Lions incredibly stimulating and there is no doubt that I think that all the four nations have benefited incredibly from the tours. Everyone takes the best out of the tour back to their home nation and club and implements the things that have been successful, as a player or coach.""

Having first worked as an assistant coach under Sir Ian McGeechan on the tour of South Africa in 2009, Gatland's passion for the Lions is a central theme of his autobiography Pride and Passion, which has been shortlisted for the Rugby Book of the Year at the Telegraph Sports Book Awards.

Having guided the tourists to victory in Australia in 2013, and a historic drawn series against New Zealand four years later, Gatland has already secured his place in Lions folklore. Next year offers him the chance to complete what is likely to be his last tour in charge unbeaten against the southern hemisphere ""big three"".

""The dream is to be undefeated in the Test series in three tours as head coach,"" he added. ""Going forward it is probably an opportunity for someone else to step up and take the mantle. If I can be of any service, in terms of helping the Lions, in terms of sharing experiences, I would love to follow them again.

""I still have a huge passion for it and am very fortunate for my experiences I have had. I have done my time. But it is like anything, they might come and knock on my door and say 'We don't think anyone else has got the experience and would you do it again?'

""Then you reassess everything but they would probably say I have been in charge for three tours, is it right for someone else to have a go. I am comfortable with that."""|1
2020-06-20|"Despite the growing importance of services in output and trade, there has been relatively little information on how services policies have evolved over the past decades. This column presents evidence on services trade policies from a new database created by the World Bank and WTO. It reveals that higher income economies are more open on average than developing economies, but the chronology of reform varies across sectors. In addition, while explicit restrictions are being lowered, regulatory scrutiny is increasing in most sectors, especially in higher income economies.

Economic policy has changed dramatically since the Great Recession. The post-WWII liberalising trend in goods trade is being reversed and multilateral cooperation is ceding ground to a more nationalistic view of policy (World Bank 2020). At the same time, technological change is accelerating, especially in response to the COVID-19 shock. In this changing environment, it has been possible to closely track goods trade policies, but there is much less information on how services policies have evolved despite the growing importance of services in output and trade (WTO 2019).

This gap in information matters because services are intimately linked to developments over the last decade. For instance, the Great Recession originated in financial markets where regulation failed to keep step with liberalisation (Rajan 2010); the emergence of new digital platforms is transforming business, retail, communication, transport, and financial services; and the improvements in information and communication technology could be ushering in a new era of cross-border trade in services (Baldwin 2019). Are governments reacting to these developments proactively through radical reform, defensively by imposing new restrictions, or inertially by doing nothing?

To answer this question and to facilitate the empirical analysis of policy change, the World Bank and the WTO engaged in a major policy data collection and quantification exercise, which resulted in a new World Bank-WTO Services Trade Policy Database (STPD). This database contains information on the services trade policies in five broad areas – financial, telecommunication, distribution, transportation, and professional services. The STPD contains information not just on core trade policies but also on other increasingly relevant regulatory measures such as licensing conditions and restrictions on cross-border data flows.

Policy restrictiveness is quantified following an improved Services Trade Restrictions Index (STRI) that aggregates the qualitative information within a single consistent and transparent measure. Data previously collected by the World Bank over 2008-2011 were adjusted to the new classification and quantified based on the updated STRI methodology. The harmonised data make it possible for the first time to compare services trade policies over a long period of time – between 2008 and 2016 – for a large cross-section of 55 advanced and developing economies.

On the basis of that information, it is possible to identify patterns of services trade policies across economies and sectors as well as secular trends in policy making over the past decade. On the face of it, services trade regimes are generally becoming more open, at least as far as explicit restrictions are concerned, in apparent contrast to recent changes in goods trade policy. Most recently, however, services trade policy is also becoming more restrictive, especially in digitally traded computer and audio-visual services (OECD 2020). Tightening measures in 2019 mostly affected foreign investment and the movement of people.

This most recent turn of events notwithstanding, higher income economies are still more open on average than lower income economies in most sectors. The decrease in policy restrictiveness since 2008, i.e. over nearly a decade, is slightly more pronounced for high-income economies (Figure 1). At the same time, some dynamic developing economies such as Bangladesh, India, and China have also liberalised significantly in the past decade. Other lower-income and middle-income economies that have liberalised their services trade policies appreciably (by at least five points on average) are Ecuador, Uruguay, Indonesia, Tunisia, Thailand, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Pakistan. Underlying these patterns of overall liberalisation across economies are differences in the sectoral pattern of liberalisation. We illustrate these below by focusing on two sectors: financial services (especially commercial banking) and professional services (auditing).

Figure 1 Services trade policy has become more open since the Great Recession (Changes in STRI between 2008-2011 and 2016 by level of income)

All sectors have been liberalized but by varying degrees. Broad waves in services policy reform can be identified. Higher income economies have led the way, pioneering the opening up of telecommunications and finance to foreign competition in the 1980s and 1990s. Hence, the picture already emerging a decade ago in these two sectors was of general openness in higher income economies, and of varying degrees of liberalisation in developing economies. The new database reveals that since 2008 developing economies have started to reform those sectors that were first liberalised by higher income economies, while the latter have embarked on the liberalisation of other sectors, notably professional and transport services. Hence, the picture emerging more recently is of policy convergence in telecommunications and finance driven by liberalisation by hitherto more restrictive developing economies, and divergence and dispersion in sectors such as professional and transport services.

There are particularly striking examples of recent reforms in financial services in some of the most dynamic developing countries such as Bangladesh, Kenya, the Philippines or Vietnam (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Limited convergence in financial services trade openness (Changes in STRI between 2008-2011 and 2016 by level of income)

Digging deeper into the policy data on commercial banking services reveals certain patterns. A large majority of economies now allow entry into their markets through the acquisition and control of domestic entities, through the establishment of wholly owned subsidiaries, or through direct branching. The preferred avenue is the acquisition of already licensed institutions, which may be explained by the host regulators' wish to recapitalise local banks (notably after the 2008-2009 financial crisis) while maintaining the existing market structure and therefore the current intensity of competition. Both fully owned subsidiaries and direct branches have been increasingly allowed in most economies, but the former remains a preferred option for local regulators, given the potential for risk transmission that foreign bank branches present, as was evident in the financial crisis. Interestingly, no economy in our sample abrogated access through branching – the increased share of governments allowing this form of entry is the result therefore of additional liberalisation in emerging economies (e.g. Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, Philippines, Russian Federation).

Even though there are now fewer explicit restrictions on entry, scrutiny of foreign banks has remained intense or even been strengthened. For instance, even when the presence through branching is allowed, stringent regulatory conditions (e.g. imposition of endowment capital requirements, limitations on the expansion of the branching network) are imposed in a majority of economies. In addition, roughly a quarter of our sample now applies different licensing criteria for foreign banks. Finally, more than half of the economies in our sample subject foreign banks to either economic needs tests, investment screening requirements or non-automatic licensing approvals (even when all formal licensing criteria have been fulfilled).

Figure 3 Divergence in auditing services trade openness (Changes in STRI between 2008-2011 and 2016 by level of income)

Policy dispersion is still the norm in sectors that joined the liberalisation wave more recently and in a more limited number of economies. In auditing, most of the decrease in the STRI is linked to less restrictive policies regarding the entry of professionals in high-income and middle-income economies, as well as the loosening of restrictions for cross-border supply for high-income economies. Restrictions on commercial presence were reduced only slightly, with highly restrictive economies remaining so in 2016 (India, Korea, Panama, the Philippines, Turkey).

The high-income economies presenting the biggest reductions in restrictiveness are Japan and some EU members, where reforms in the auditing subsector came into force in June 2016 in the aftermath of the financial crisis. One of the aims was to improve auditing quality, and to introduce rotation of auditors because of the concentration of the market. One of the tools envisaged in that regard was to facilitate cross-border provision of statutory audit services. Focusing more specifically on the temporary movement of natural persons supplying services, restrictions have decreased since 2008-2011 in European economies and in some other high-income countries (e.g. Canada, Japan, US). This was accomplished either by relaxing some of the economy-wide restrictions on the movement of persons (quantitative limitations), the lifting of nationality or residency requirements to obtain a license to practice, or the recognition of foreign qualifications.

To conclude, the last decade has seen steady and widespread liberalisation, but with a twist. While markets in services, e.g. finance and telecommunications, are increasingly free from explicit restrictions on entry and ownership, they are increasingly subject to greater regulatory scrutiny (e.g. economic needs tests, FDI screening), especially in higher income economies. This raises several"|1
2020-06-20|"The COVID-19 crisis is depressing growth globally, and lockdown measures are causing widespread job losses. This column illustrates that women are amongst the worst affected. Women are vulnerable not only because of their jobs, but also because of gender inequalities within housework division, education, and health. There is an urgent need to support women, repair gender disparities aggravated by crisis, and to reduce women’s vulnerability going forward. Gender-responsive fiscal measures are viable tools that work in the interests of women, as well as supporting economic growth and reducing poverty and inequality.

The COVID-19 pandemic has killed more than 400,000 people worldwide and has generated a massive global economic crisis. The world economy is projected to contract sharply by 3% in 2020 (IMF 2020) and poverty is set to rise for the first time since 1998, bringing 40-60 million people into extreme poverty (World Bank 2020). However, unlike previous economic crises, this crisis will negatively affect women more than men, creating a significant blow for gender equality. Policymakers should step up their efforts to reestablish the path towards a more equal society for men and women.

A huge setback in the quest for gender equality

Gender inequality had diminished over the past 30 years. For instance, the gap between male and female labour force participation decreased by eight percentage points due to the large gains in female labour force participation, especially within advanced economies (Figure 1). Educational attainment gaps also narrowed around the world with 35 countries having achieved full parity, and 120 countries closing at least 95% of their educational gender gaps (WEF 2020). The maternal mortality ratio had dropped by about 38% worldwide.

This encouraging progress, however, is likely to suffer huge setbacks during the COVID-19 crisis. There are various reasons why the current crisis disproportionally impacts women. First, women are more likely than men to work in social sectors (such as hospitality, retail, restaurants, and tourism), which require face-to-face interactions (Figure 2). These are the sectors that are being hit the hardest by social distancing (Hupkau and Petrongolo 2020). For example, in the US, almost 74% of women work in social sectors, compared to 48% of men (in 2019). Further, data for the first four months of the year indicate that employment in these sectors shrank by 18%, compared to 10% in other sectors (Shibata 2020). In developing countries, women are also more likely to be employed in social sectors than men. Notwithstanding, an even bigger concern in many of these countries is that women often work in the informal sector more frequently than men, and therefore have less job security and social protection, as well as lower pay (ILO 2018). Second, women, who usually carry the highest-burden of housework (Alonso et al. 2019, Alon et al. 2020), are bearing most of the epidemic-related costs triggered by school closures and the health risks posed to elderly family members. Uncertainty about schools reopening and fears of contagion of the most vulnerable can lead to women exiting the labour force for a prolonged period of time, entailing long-term costs to their careers. Third, in developing countries, the burden on the healthcare system is reducing access to family planning and increasing the chances of maternal mortality (UNPA Women 2020). Finally, in many developing economies (where girls in normal times already feel the pressure to drop out of school), the COVID-19 crisis may induce even more female dropouts. Dropping out from school creates a permanent loss in human capital and narrows girls’ chances of improving their living standards.

Note: Social sectors are defined as the sum of the following sectors: wholesale and retail trade, accommodation and food service activities, real estate, business and administrative activities, education, human health and social work activities and other services.

The policy challenge: Gender equality, boosting growth, and reducing poverty and inequality

Policymakers around the world are focusing on responding to the crisis’ immediate effects, fighting the devastating impact of the pandemic on people’s lives and national healthcare systems (Deb et al. 2020, Queisser at al. 2020), as well as trying to maintain functioning economies. Nevertheless, policymakers must also plan for the future. How can we return to a path of sustainable economic growth and regain the lost ground in gender equality, while fighting poverty and inequality? These are daunting tasks – but gender-responsive fiscal policies can help. The appropriate set of policies will depend, among other things, on the country’s level of development. For example, ensuring access to caregiving support (when economic activities outside of the household resume) is crucial for women to be able to go back to work in the developed world. In developing countries, increasing efforts to keep girls in school is key for building and protecting future human capital.

As shown in our recent paper (Fabrizio et al. 2020), fiscal policies that address gender equality (such as investing in education and infrastructure, subsidising childcare, and offering parental leave) can create economic opportunities for women. These policies also generate economic growth and reduce poverty and inequality, while paying for themselves in the long run. For example:
• Subsidised childcare. The high cost, and uneven supply, of childcare represents a barrier for many women (particularly the low-skilled and poor) to participate in the labour force. Poor women typically face higher childcare costs relative to their income. For example, in the US, poorer women spend 17.4% of their income on childcare, compared to 7.8% for richer women. These women are also at higher risk of losing their jobs because of the current pandemic. Subsidising childcare is a ‘win-win’ policy. It stimulates female labour force participation and generates jobs in the childcare sector. For illustration, life-cycle model simulations suggest that expanding childcare subsidies in order to reduce its cost by half (for middle-class working mothers) in the US would lead to an increase in female labour force participation by almost five percentage points. Women at the bottom of the income distribution (that currently do not have access to the Child Care Development Fund) would benefit the most. Our paper shows that this policy would reduce poverty in the US by up to 0.2 percentage points, and increase economic activity by up to 0.5 percent by widening the pool of workers.
• Investing in education. As argued above, the COVID-19 crisis can hamper progress made in closing gender gaps in education, as girls are usually the first to drop out of school if families need additional help at home. A more educated labour force is more resilient and flexible. Closing gender gaps in education boosts female human capital, raising women’s expected salaries and giving them more incentives to pursue careers. On aggregate, this would also positively impact productivity for the future, thus accelerating economic growth. For illustration, life-cycle model simulations suggest that investing sufficiently in education to close gender gaps at each income level in Senegal could boost output by almost 9%, while reducing poverty by more than ten percentage points, and cut inequality (as measured by the Gini coefficient) by almost three percentage points.

The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting all countries, destroying jobs, increasing poverty, and putting at risk the hard-won gender equality gains of the last few decades. Policymakers around the world are rightly focusing on responding to the immediate crisis, fighting the devastating effects of the pandemic on healthcare systems whist trying to keep their economies alive. The next step is to find the tools to sustain economic growth, fight poverty, and regain the lost ground in gender equality―gender-responsive fiscal policies are a viable answer.

2020-06-20|"The protective metal boards surrounding Winston Churchill’s statue in Parliament Square came down this week ahead of French president Emmanuel Macron’s visit to London to mark a wartime anniversary. But the debate over Britain’s public monuments is not over and Oxford’s Oriel College said this week that it would move a statue of 19th-century imperialist Cecil Rhodes from its front entrance.

Boris Johnson said on Monday that instead of taking down controversial statues, Britain should put up new ones, pointing to empty plinths in the courtyard of the foreign and commonwealth office that were waiting to be occupied by contemporary heroes. Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy suggested that it was time to take a look at the art inside that building, notably a series of murals by Sigismund Goetze celebrating the expansion of the British Empire, one of which depicts Africa as a small naked boy carrying a basket of fruit.

“As we leave the European Union and start to reach out to other parts of the world, those relationships become incredibly important to us, particularly relationships with Commonwealth countries and countries that were part of the empire,” Nandy said in a Zoom interview from her home in Wigan this week.

“There is a very mixed legacy across the world for Britain in relation to that. And some of the works of art on display at the foreign office do not project the sort of relationship and the high esteem in which we hold those countries. And they depict many of those former empire countries as bending at the knee of the mighty British Empire, when what we seek in modern times is a partnership with those countries based on their strengths, assets and attributes and our own as well.”

Nandy’s family background embraces two sides of the legacy of the British Empire. Her father was Dipak Nandy, a Marxist academic who moved to Britain from Kolkata and helped to draft the Race Relations Act in 1976. Her mother Louise Byers, who was the daughter of Liberal MP Frank Byers, worked as a TV current affairs producer.

The MP for Wigan since 2010, Nandy served in the shadow cabinet under Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn but she resigned from Corbyn’s team in 2016 and backed Owen Smith’s unsuccessful leadership challenge. She ran for the leadership this year, coming third behind Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey.

The campaign enhanced Nandy’s reputation, however, as she outperformed her rivals in TV interviews and revealed herself to be a more complex politician than many Labour members had known. For the past few years, Nandy has been associated with efforts to keep Labour connected to its traditional heartlands outside London, championing the interests of towns and opposing the push for a second Brexit referendum.

She lost the argument within the party before the election when she was calling for Labour to join forces with moderate Conservatives to back a soft Brexit deal. But she is now in the mainstream alongside Labour leader Starmer in accepting that the central Brexit argument is over and refusing to press the government to extend the transition period beyond the end of this year.

“We’ve been smashed apart in the Labour Party over Brexit. Not just our electoral coalition, but our party membership, our members of parliament as well over the last four years. But we’re now in a position where we saw the entire Labour base collapse beneath our feet in many of those parts of the country that voted to leave and that had traditionally voted Labour through three successive generations,” she said.

“I think there’s now a recognition right across the Labour movement that we’ve got to get a deal by the end of the year. And we’ve also got to stand up for those very close, deep relationships with the EU as a whole and with individual countries within the European Union more generally.”

Nandy says that Labour’s foreign policy will not change in its essentials and the party will remain internationalist in outlook with a commitment to human rights and the rule of law. But she has adopted a tougher stance on China, finding common cause with some Conservative MPs in questioning the role of Chinese companies like Huawei in British infrastructure.

“We think you need a twin-pillar strategy in relation to China. On the one hand, you need the strategic independence by investing in homegrown industry and by building those alliances overseas to give us a degree of detachment that allows us to speak and act from a position of values,” she said.

“But equally, you need a level of constructive engagement with China. There is no global challenge that can be solved without the involvement of the Chinese government, whether it’s Covid-19, climate change or the issues in the world economy, reform of our major institutions. China remains a very, very important partner for the world. Often the situation with the US and China is likened to the cold war. We believe it isn’t at all. It’s far more complex than the cold war and we’ve got to maintain those links.”

Labour has remained part of the Party of European Socialists and Nandy believes the party can learn from the experience of other centre-left parties. She suggests that most such parties have faced the same challenge of trying to keep together two parts of an electoral coalition that have experienced globalisation very differently.

Although she recognises how steep Labour’s challenge is, she draws some hope from the fact that the party under Starmer recognises that it must move beyond what she calls the “one more heave” mentality.

“There’s a sort of mythology on the left around and around our history in Britain, that after the war the country realised that this was a huge moment when things had to change and we were propelled to power where we built the institutions, the NHS and the welfare state that have lasted to this day. Now, that is true but what we forget is that six years later, we were out of power and we’ve largely been in retreat, trying to defend those institutions ever since.

“So there’s a real need for Labour to go out into the country and start to make the case for how we’re going to bring different parts of the country together, particularly with the length and depth of the recession that’s about to hit,” she said.

“I think that is likely to be concentrated in many of those areas that already lacked the resilience before. So coastal towns, which are heavily reliant on the tourism industry, are likely to see a disproportionate impact. And we’ve got a lot of ex-industrial towns where the last Labour government used the public sector to try to kickstart the economy. And as the public sector is contracted, that’s left us with a real problem.

“The other jobs that exist in those places are not well-paid, white-collar jobs. They’re the insecure agency jobs. So for all of those reasons, the parts of the country that we’re seeking to win back at the next election are going to feel the impact of this economic recession harder. And we’ve got to make sure that we are their champion.”"|0
2020-06-20|"Japanese geisha ""Chacha"" sits on her knees with her fingertips neatly placed on the wooden floor, gracefully bowing to an audience sitting not in front of her but miles away, watching online.

Beneath spotlights, the graceful 32-year-old geisha performs a traditional dance, moving like a butterfly and artfully unfolding and fluttering her fan.

The audience would usually be a group of older, wealthy men, watching appreciatively inside a traditional parlour lined with woven tatami mats.

But today, Chacha's audience is looking back at her from a computer screen, and ranges from a young woman with a glass of wine in her hand to a family with several curious children.

""How have you been at home?"" asked Chacha, addressing her audience.

""I was playing 'Animal Crossing' all the time during the state of emergency!"" she added.

While Japan has been spared the worst of the coronavirus outbreak, a state of emergency was declared during a spike in cases and the pandemic has nixed most forms of nightlife, including geisha parties.

Despite Western misconceptions, geishas are not prostitutes, but rather entertainers and raconteurs highly skilled in traditional Japanese dance, musical instruments and games.

Almost everything in the repertoire of these performers – from singing and dancing in small enclosed spaces, to entertaining customers with witty conversation and delicately pouring sake in a customer's cup – is at odds with the social distancing rules of the coronavirus pandemic.

That has been devastating for geisha like Chacha, who has seen her salary evaporate and is eagerly awaiting the arrival of government stimulus funds.

""Usually we are very busy in April, May and June,"" she told AFP. ""But this year, we have no parties, zero.""

That's where the online service has come in.

It grew from a project called ""Meet Geisha"" – initially conceived as a way to bring groups of tourists to see geisha perform on stage in a more relaxed and less intimidating environment.

Launched last year by an IT firm, it was supposed to capitalise on an influx of tourists, including those coming for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

But with the coronavirus pandemic forcing the postponement of the Games and shutting down international travel, the firm looked at other options.

They approached the geisha community in Hakone, around 80km southwest of Tokyo, about an online option, said project manager Tamaki Nishimura.

""They are up for new challenges, not necessarily bound by traditional styles,"" she told AFP.

While geisha culture is strongly associated with the city of Kyoto, communities exist throughout Japan, with about 150 active geishas in Hakone.

""If it weren't for the geishas in Hakone, I wouldn't probably have gotten a yes for the online service,"" Nishimura added.

Chacha admits she was initially confused by the idea – she doesn't own a computer, just an iPad, and says she has no idea how to even switch one on.

""I had a big question mark in my head,"" she laughed.

But with Nishimura's help to organise the technical side, Chacha and a handful of other geishas are now able to offer their traditional arts in the most modern of formats – Zoom calls.

The online sessions offer income, but also a way to broaden the audience.

""One objective of this service is to reach out to new, younger customer groups because the price is set at the cheaper end,"" Nishimura said.

""Once we had a group of eight young people in South Korea who bought this service as a birthday present for one of them. That was a way of enjoying this that went beyond what we had expected.""

Michiko Maeda, 65, one of Chacha's online female guests, said the new format had encouraged her to experience the traditional entertainment.

""I think many people feel that geisha entertainment is not really for women,"" she said.

""But once you know women can also enjoy it, intially online, I think more of us will go and visit Hakone geisha parlours. Right, everyone?"" she said, as other female guests nodded in agreement on the split screen.

Chacha acknowledges the new technology ""allows people overseas and those who cannot physically visit Hakone to meet me"".

But she is hoping for a return to tradition when the rules allow.

""Someday I want them to come here, see our performance live and interact with us for real. That is what I truly wish for."" – AFP Relaxnews"|2
2020-06-20|"The impact of COVID-19 on insurers

The grim impact of COVID-19 – extensive financial dislocations across asset classes and potentially large increases in morbidity and mortality – could pose a challenge to the insurance industry, particularly life insurers. This column urges central banks looking to preserve credit supply to account for changes in insurer risk appetite, which could take place well before capital levels approach regulatory thresholds. Financial stability assessments should examine the implications of the pandemic for insurers, which operate in some countries on a comparable scale to banks.

While much attention has been paid to the impact of COVID-19 on banks (for examples of prominent early work, see Beck 2020, Cecchetti and Schoenholtz 2020), insurers have received less attention. Insurers are important financial intermediaries, holding more than $30 trillion in assets globally (FSB 2020), and operating on a comparable scale to banks in some countries.

COVID-19 will affect insurers both directly, via health shocks (increases in mortality and morbidity), and indirectly, via financial shocks (higher credit spreads, potentially widespread downgrades, lower interest rates, and lower equity prices). The financial impact of pandemics is often much larger than the direct health impact, as even comparatively mild outbreaks can have a large economic footprint (McKibbin and Fernando 2020).

Insurers’ exposure to COVID-19 varies by their line of business. For example, life insurers’ liabilities commit them to payouts decades ahead, and are very sensitive to changes in interest rates. Although these long-term liabilities permit longer investment horizons, potentially supporting financial stability (Chodorow-Reich et al. 2020, IAIS 2019), life insurers are more directly affected by pandemics through their liabilities. If insurers are hit hard, risk appetite may be impaired—as was the case following the global financial crisis (Kirti 2019)—affecting the availability of credit for riskier borrowers. Policymakers working to preserve credit supply to the economy should account for any changes to insurers’ risk appetite.

We present estimates of the impact of COVID-19 on capitalisation levels for US life insurers, considering both the direct pandemic shock and the indirect financial shock.

Life insurers provide protection against both mortality and longevity risk. Joint provision of both types of protection can help insurers manage risk. In a pandemic with significant mortality impact, life insurance claims rise immediately, whereas expected future payments on life-contingent annuities fall. These risks can therefore offset each other from a long-term solvency perspective, although large life insurance claims may have a meaningful short-term impact. Moreover, for annuities in the accumulation phase, as is the case for a majority of US annuities, account values are typically payable upon death.

We focus on the impact of potentially larger mortality on life insurance claims. We base key assumptions (share of population with coverage and average size of policy by age group, and the extent to which mortality may be lower conditional on coverage) on SOA (2007) and apply case fatality rates by age group as experienced in Korea (a more benign scenario) or Italy (a more severe scenario with limited health care capacity) as of early June.

Although the pandemic appears to be tapering in Europe and even in the US as of early June 2020, it is difficult to exclude further waves of infections. Figure 1 shows the impact on US life insurers as a share of capital given the share of the population affected by COVID-19. Insurers, regulators, and industry observers typically use an excess death ratio of 1.5 per 1,000 as a standard pandemic stress test scenario. In the US, this would imply about 500,000 deaths (about 8% of the population affected with case fatality rates in Korea, and about 4% with case fatality rates in Italy), larger than current estimates of the potential death toll released by US authorities. In such a scenario, losses would be about $15 billion, or about 3% of pre-shock industry capital.4 Should the pandemic prove challenging to control (with treatment and vaccines remaining elusive), an extreme scenario more comparable to the 1918 Spanish flu (closer to 30% of the population affected with case fatality rates in Korea) could become relevant. In such a scenario, losses would be about $45-55 billion—about 10% of pre-shock capital. Such a scenario would likely unfold over multiple years, giving insurers time to accumulate additional net premium income.

Figure 1 Impact of potential mortality claims on US life insurer regulatory capital

Sources: S&P Global Market Intelligence and IMF staff analysis.

Note: This figure shows the US life insurance industry’s aggregate capital net of pre-tax excess claims as a function of the share of population infected. Estimates are based on the age-group-specific number of policyholders and average face amount in force used by SOA (2007), adjusted to match the current US population and stock of life insurance in force net of reinsurance as of end 2019 (close to $20 trillion). Case fatality rates by age group as of 3 June 2020 are from the Italian National Institute of Health and the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare. Case fatality rates are assumed to be 23% lower for the insured population as in the severe scenario used by SOA (2007).

US life insurers are generally not required to mark bonds to market for the purpose of determining regulatory capital. Capital requirements for US insurers are tied to regulatory risk categorisation of assets. For most asset classes, regulatory risk categories are a function of credit ratings. US life insurers’ holdings are somewhat skewed toward bonds only one or two rating notches above regulatory thresholds for significantly higher risk weights (Kirti and Shin 2020, Becker and Ivashina 2015).[vii] Risk weights for junk bonds are more than triple those for investment grade bonds. Downgraded bonds tend to be sold by insurers facing capital pressure (Ellul et al. 2011). We focus on the impact of bond downgrades on required capital.

Despite unprecedented policy responses from monetary and fiscal authorities, many corporate issuers may face rating downgrades due to the widespread economic fallout from COVID-19; the extent to which some sectors will face serious solvency concerns in any ‘new normal’ is not yet clear. If downgrades move assets into higher-risk regulatory categories, capital requirements would increase. Downgraded bonds may see fire sales, particularly if downgrades are widespread, although selling distressed assets would potentially trigger recognition of losses that permanently impair regulatory capital for US insurers, which would disincentivise fire sales.

We use bond-level holdings data for all US life insurers as of the fourth quarter of 2019, along with bond ratings (and downgrades) as of end-May. More than $60 billion in bond holdings have already been downgraded across categories, while $210 billion have been downgraded at least one rating notch. We consider two further scenarios: a moderate scenario in which 50% of bonds (by value) one notch away from regulatory thresholds are downgraded into the next category, along with 25% of bonds two notches away; and a severe scenario with double these downgrade rates.

Figure 2 shows how risk-based capital (RBC) ratios (the ratio of actual capital held to required capital) would be affected under different scenarios. US insurers must submit corrective action plans if their RBC ratio is below 150% and has a negative trend, or falls below 100%, and can be placed under regulatory control if their RBC ratio falls below 50%.10 The median RBC ratio is above 400%, with some insurers already below 200%. The severe downgrade scenario would significantly lower RBC ratios and bring some insurers close to or below company action thresholds.

Figure 2 Impact of potential bond downgrades on US life insurer RBC ratios

Note: This figure shows the distribution of RBC ratios for (1) the current level (as reported in 2019), (2) the actual level (accounting for actual downgrades to date), (3) the moderate scenario (half of one-rating-notch-above and a quarter of two-rating-notches-above corporate bonds are downgraded into the next NAIC category), and (4) the severe scenario (all of one-rating-notch-above and half of two-rating-notches-above corporate bonds are downgraded into the next NAIC category). The RBC ratio is total adjusted capital divided by two times authorised control level (required) capital. The figure is restricted to insurers with assets of more than $5 billion. Observations outside the 10th and 90th percentiles are not shown.

Joint impact of health and financial shocks

Figure 3 illustrates the joint impact of the health and financial shocks. Panel A shows an indicative aggregate RBC ratio in three increasingly severe scenarios in addition to the pre-shock level: (1) the upper end of a mortality scenario presented by US authorities in late March (240,000 deaths) along with rating downgrades as of end May; (2) deaths in a standard pandemic stress test scenario (1.5 excess deaths per 1,000, or about 500,000 deaths) combined with the moderate financial shock scenario; and (3) deaths in line with Spanish flu (using excess deaths in the US reported by Barro et al. 2020) combined with the severe financial shock scenario (1.7 million deaths).

Panel B shows the impact for the largest US life insurers by net life insurance in force for the same set of scenarios. Under severe joint shock scenarios, capital levels for several large insurers would approach, and in the case of one insurer breach, regulatory thresholds.

HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) -- Five-time PGA Tour winner Nick Watney tested positive Friday for the coronavirus, the first player with a confirmed infection since golf resumed a full schedule last week.

Watney immediately withdrew from the RBC Heritage and must self-isolate for at least 10 days under the PGA Tour's protocols.

He did not return a telephone call seeking comment. Watney played the opening round with Vaughn Taylor and Luke List, and a rules official notified them at the turn of the positive test.

''I was a little shocked, to be honest,'' Taylor said. ''Heart started racing, got a little nervous. Just hope Nick is doing well and we get through this.''

Watney missed the cut last week in the Charles Schwab Challenge at Colonial in Fort Worth, Texas. He traveled on his own to South Carolina, and his coronavirus test upon arrival at Harbour Town was negative.

Before arriving to the course for his second round, he reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Watney was tested again, and the result came back positive.

Si Woo Kim saw him in passing on the range, and Rory McIlroy said he chatted with Watney on the putting green. McIlroy said they were at a distance, and that Watney sent him a text about the positive result after McIlroy finished his round.

''He was just saying, 'Look, I hope I didn't get too close to you.' He feels badly that he was here today at the golf course,'' McIlroy said. ''I said to him, 'If I was in your position, I probably would have been here, too. At this point, you just have to concentrate on getting better and getting healthy.'''

List won last week on the Korn Ferry Tour, where one player and three caddies tested positive before the event and did not come to the courses, and two non-players tested positive before this week's event, both in Florida.

He missed the cut at Hilton Head with a 73.

''It was hard to concentrate out there for me, just thinking about different stuff, and I wasn't playing my best, anyway,'' List said. ''It would be nice if they had an option - you can kind of say if you want to know or not in a situation like that. I would definitely like to find out after the round next time.''

As for another test, List said even if tested, ''it might not show up until a few days down the road. So there's a lot of different scenarios.''

The tour had no positive tests of the 487 administered at Colonial, and none among the 98 players tested before taking the charter to Hilton Head or the 369 tests for those arriving on their own.

Jordan Spieth, one of four players on the PGA Tour's policy board, didn't sound surprised at golf's first positive test.

''The whole plan put in place was not if, but when somebody tests positive, what's the protocol, and what are the next steps,'' Spieth said. ''So I feel confident, just in being on those phone calls, in what the PGA Tour is going to do going forward. Hopefully, contact tracing doesn't lead to anybody else testing positive within the bubble.''

The tour said in a statement it has started its response plan, which includes those who have had close contact with Watney. It said it would have no further statement.

Taylor, who made the cut with two strokes to spare, said he had no close contact with Watney on Thursday, and he washed his hands immediately after the round.

''Nick never coughed or sneezed, so I feel comfortable,'' he said.

As part of the contact tracing plan, Taylor, List and their caddies were to be tested immediately.

''If you contract it, that's fine, but then it's the fact that who have you come into contact with, and who you might have exposed and stuff,'' McIlroy said. ''Look, we're still in the middle of a pandemic. Until this thing's over, we all just have to stay vigilant and keep your distance and wear our masks if we're going out in public and keep washing our hands.''

The PGA Tour is scheduled to play next week in Cromwell, Connecticut, where the Travelers Championship is testing everyone - including volunteers and media - who will be on property.

Tournament organizers made that decision. The PGA Tour has tried to create a bubble of its key people at tournaments, designating player hotels as an option and urging everyone in the bubble to avoid outside contact. Some players have been renting houses. There is no regulation if they choose to eat out.

Hilton Head has been particularly busy this week, with local restaurants packed with people who typically come to this quiet island on the Atlantic coast for vacation.

''South Carolina's open. If you go anywhere to a restaurant, there's a lot of people there right now,'' Spieth said. ''So I guess that's probably best case is that he got it on his own outside'' the bubble.

Sebastian Munoz said ''there's just too many people hanging around'' the island.

''It's a pandemic, you know? A lot of people get it, and eventually one of us was going to get it,'' Munoz said. ''I feel good that we caught early with one guy so far. So hopefully, it doesn't rise up pretty quick.''

Under the tour's guidelines for a positive test, Watney is to self-isolate for at least 10 days. He can end his self-isolation after 10 days provided he has no subsequent symptoms or has two negative test results 24 hours apart or more.

The tour will provide a stipend to pay for the costs of his self-isolation.

Watney's most recent victory was in 2012 at Bethpage Black in the FedEx Cup playoff opener. He has struggled to regain his top form since missing 10 months in 2016 because of back surgery."|0

As cases in the state of California hit a new record, Los Angles County’s numbers fell on Thursday from county’s own recent record highs.

On Friday the county announced it had recorded 1,414 new cases for Thursday. That was down from a record 2,126 new cases reported on Wednesday. Wednesday’s number also included 600 delayed cases from one testing lab.

By comparison, there were 1633 new cases in the county as of last Friday, according to the health department. That was the third-highest one day total since the outbreak began, according the L.A. county coronavirus dashboard. Friday’s number included 500 delayed cases from one lab.

Last Thursday, the Department of Public Health reported 1,857 new confirmed coronavirus cases. Before this Wednesday’s numbers were released, last Thursday represented the largest single-day number of new cases announced by the county during the entire pandemic. But health officials said, again, roughly 600 of those cases were the result of a backlog in the reporting of test results. Long Beach and Pasadena, which have their own health departments, combined to confirm an additional 84 cases. That gave the county 1,941 new confirmed cases total last Thursday.

Daily testing numbers over the same period remained steady, or fell slightly, according to L.A. County’s testing chart.

In the midst of this up-and-down, on Thursday California Governor Gavin Newsom issued at statewide order mandating masks in public places.

On Friday, Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer added her voice to the chorus urging residents to wear masks:

Since May 13, Public Health has been requiring that everyone wear a cloth face covering when in contact with others not in their household. A lot of questions are raised about why this is important, especially by individuals who are not worried about becoming infected themselves. The important issue here is that we are not asking you to wear the face covering to protect yourself. We ask you to cover your mouth and nose to protect others, especially since you can be infected with COVID-19 and have no illness symptoms; this is how you keep your respiratory droplets from reaching someone else.

On Friday, Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer added her voice to the chorus urging residents to wear masks:

Since May 13, Public Health has been requiring that everyone wear a cloth face covering when in contact with others not in their household. A lot of questions are raised about why this is important, especially by individuals who are not worried about becoming infected themselves. The important issue here is that we are not asking you to wear the face covering to protect yourself. We ask you to cover your mouth and nose to protect others, especially since you can be infected with COVID-19 and have no illness symptoms; this is how you keep your respiratory droplets from reaching someone else."|1
2020-06-19|"Soccer has taken Manheim Township alum Jaclyn Poucel Árnason from Neffsville to a college career at the University of Pittsburgh to a pro career in Finland, Iceland and Scotland.

But she felt it necessary to retire from the game game in 2017 in order to pursue other passions.

“It was taking too much of a toll on my mental health,” Poucel Árnason said recently. “I had spent so much time on it (soccer) my whole life that I never was able to give myself the opportunity to do other things.”

Those other things have since blossomed into a career as an artist and a part-time educator teaching students in Iceland how to speak English.

Poucel Árnason has been living in Iceland since January, about a month after marrying Benedikt Árnason, an Iceland native who also plays professional soccer.

“When my former team heard I was moving back to Iceland they wanted me to play again,” Poucel Árnason said.

That Icelandic team is IA Akranes, for which Poucel Árnason played in 2016.

“I started training in January,” Poucel Árnason said. “Before the pandemic shut things down.”

In its early stages, the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc among Iceland’s small population of less than 370,000 residents. By comparison, Lancaster County’s 2019 population was more than 545,000 people.

Thanks to a rigorous protocol of tracking and tracing in Iceland, the coronavirus has more or less been eliminated, leading to the country reopening its borders June 15.

According to a recent report from CNN.com, three per 100,000 people in Iceland tested positive for the coronavirus.

“Iceland did a very good job at shutting down quickly and upholding the rules being told to us by our government,” Poucel Árnason said.

As a result, pro sports in Iceland has returned in recent weeks.

“500 people are now allowed to be in one area,” Poucel Árnason said. “So depending on the stadium or game, each section can only have 500 (spectators) and it has to have its own entrance and toilet access.”

IA Akranes is already two games into its 2020 season, with Poucel Árnason having tallied three goals despite playing from her primary position as a central defender. Not too bad for someone who hadn’t played the sport professionally in about three years.

“I was rusty for like a week,” Poucel Árnason said. “When it comes to the technical soccer side, that stuff comes back quickly. But, physically, it’s been difficult because my body hasn’t been used to being used in that way anymore. I’ve had a lot more muscle stiffness and I’m taking longer to recover than I used to.”

As for how long Poucel intends to keep playing is another question.

“I am taking it year by year,” she said. “It’s hard to say how I’ll feel and I think it would also depend on how we do. I, of course, would love to play as long as I can physically ... and within the next few years we’d like to start a family. So nothing is set in stone yet.”

For now, she’s trying to appreciate living in the moment.

“I’ve been gifted this opportunity to return to something that used to bring me so much joy and that I thought I’d never feel again,” Poucel said. “So I’m just cherishing that my body is still able to play at a high level I love. I’m just trying to stay present."""|0

2020-06-19|BENGALURU: The districts of Kalaburagi and Udupi have reported more than 1,000 Covid-19 cases each, but seen 11 and 2 deaths, respectively,whereas Bengaluru, with 982 cases, has reported 58 fatalities. Bengaluru’s case fatality rate (CFR) at 6% is more than that of Mumbai (5.2%) and Chennai (1.5%), both of which have more than 30,000 cases.What’s driving up the CFR — or, the number of deaths for every 100 positive cases — in Bengaluru? According to experts, it’s a combination of factors: Change of hospitals midway through treatment, late diagnosis and delay in presentation of the case.Experts said a proactive district administration and involvement of private healthcare sector, especially MAHE’s Dr TMA Pai Hospital, in Udupi made a huge difference. Kalaburagi doctors, who are also shouldering burden of neighbouring districts, credited their achievement to teamwork.Dr KS Manjunath, director, Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital, said Udupi and Kalaburagi’s cases are mainly Maharashtra returnees, who are mostly asymptomatic. “Bengaluru has cases of Influenza-Like Illness and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection seeking treatment with delayed presentation. The golden hour is lost by the time the patient is brought to Covid-19 hospital,” he said.Bowring hospital has 15 Covid-19 patients in its ICU. Stating that it’s a complex situation, Dr Manjunath said, “It’s observed that cytokine storm (where the body starts to attack its own cells) and sudden thrombosis (formation of blood clots) are leading to Covid-19 deaths. These conditions are beyond doctors’ control. The focus should be in preventing such a situation and that can be achieved with early intervention,” he said.Most deaths in Bengaluru are among patients with two or more comorbidities and more than 70% of them are aged over 50, said Dr Giridhara R Babu, an epidemiologist.|1
2020-06-19|"(Reuters) - Troubling spikes in coronavirus infection rates were reported on Friday in several U.S. states, mainly in the South and West, a day before President Donald Trump was due to preside over an Oklahoma campaign rally that will be America’s largest indoor gathering in months.

Wall Street jitters over a resurgence in COVID-19 cases as states moved to reopen long-stifled commerce and ease social-distancing measures helped drive down major U.S. stock indexes, reversing earlier gains.

Experts say expanded diagnostic testing accounts for some, but not all, of the growth in cases - numbering at least 2.23 million nationwide on Friday - and that the mounting volume of infections was elevating hospitalizations in some places.

“Clearly the cases are rising rapidly. It’s not just a matter of testing more,” said Dr. Murtaza Akhter, an emergency room physician at Arizona hospitals, noting the lag time between a positive test and severe illness or death. “The real concern is what is coming up for us in the next week or two.”

He said the latest wave of cases has put Arizona’s major hospitals at or near capacity, and placed the Southwestern state on track to surpass New York at its peak on a per-capita basis.

More than 119,000 Americans have perished from COVID-19 to date, according to Reuters’ running tally.

Particularly alarming has been the upward trends several states are reporting in the percentage of positive tests among individuals who are screened, a metric experts refer to as the positivity rate.

The World Health Organization considers positivity rates above 5% to be especially concerning, and widely watched data from Johns Hopkins University shows 16 states with average rates over the past week exceeding that level and climbing.

Four were averaging double-digit rates - Arizona at 17%, Alabama at 12%, Washington state at 11% and South Carolina at 10%. The dozen others were led by Utah, Texas, Mississippi, Florida and Georgia, all averaging rates of 7.5% or higher.

Some of the latest daily figures were also disconcerting.

Arizona, where doctors and public health administrators have called for making face coverings mandatory in public, reported a record 3,246 new infections over the previous 24 hours, nearly twice those tallied on Wednesday. Its latest single-day positivity rate, from Thursday, stood at 18.6%.

In Phoenix, where the president is due to visit a church next Tuesday for a “Students for Trump” event, the city council voted at the mayor’s urging on Friday to mandate face coverings in most public places. That move came two days after Governor Doug Ducey issued an executive order allowing cities and counties to require face coverings.

Florida, one of the last states to impose stay-at-home restrictions and one of the first to begin lifting them, reported 3,822 new cases, a daily record. Its latest positivity figure was 10%, according to the state’s health department.

“The situation in Florida and Arizona is really concerning,” William Hanage, an epidemiology professor at Harvard University, adding that the spike in cases was not just due to more testing but indicative of an “underlying outbreak of unknown size.”

Even if the growth in confirmed cases partly reflects transmission among younger people less likely to be hospitalized, those people could infect the elderly and other vulnerable individuals with underlying health conditions.

“The more community transmission there is, the larger the risk that it infects somebody who is vulnerable. There are quite a lot of old people in Florida and in Arizona,” Hanage said.

Another focus of concern was in Oklahoma, where the Trump campaign will hold a rally on Saturday at a 19,000-seat indoor arena in Tulsa, his first such event since lockdowns were imposed across much of the country in March.

Public health experts have warned that assembling thousands of shouting, chanting people inside the BOK Center and an adjacent convention hall poses the risk of creating a “super-spreader” event for the highly contagious coronavirus.

Rally organizers plan to hand out masks and hand sanitizer to attendees before they enter the venue, but they will not be required to maintain social distancing or wear face coverings. They also must sign a waiver promising not to sue Trump or the campaign if they contract the virus.

Trump supporters began lining up outside the arena well in advance. One of them, Randall Thom, 60, from Lakefield, Minnesota, said on Friday the United States needed to reopen.

“We can’t be afraid of this China virus or whatever you guys want to call it. I’m not afraid of it at all,” he said. “And I am so honored that President Trump wants to do a trade for us as citizens, you know, to give us our rights to be normal again.”"|0
2020-06-21|"Businesses responding to the third statewide COVID-19 Wisconsin Business Impact survey continue to demonstrate their resilience with 41 percent of respondents introducing or expanding online services over the last three months.

Similarly, businesses continue to seek financial assistance, with 60 percent of respondents requesting assistance and 52.4 percent receiving aid. Estimates of business survivability have also increased, with only 10 percent of respondents estimating survivability of less than three months.

“It will be important to continue to assess this measure throughout the summer,” said MadREP President Paul Jadin. “Many businesses will continue to operate with significant restrictions, and we need to understand the impact to appropriately respond and support those businesses, so they are able to survive.”

The June survey of businesses impacted by the effects of COVID-19 yielded 744 results, a significant decrease from the 1,126 responses received in May and 2,424 received in April. According to Jeffrey Sachse, interim director of the Center for Customized Research and Services, the decline in participation is attributed to two related issues. “We noted a strong correlation among businesses that reported low survivability and non-response in the May survey results. This trend continued this month.” Similarly, the survey period of June 1-13 correlates with the beginning of the summer tourism season and comes three weeks after the reopening of the state. A decrease in response was anticipated as business owners continue the process of resuming operations. The results shared here are estimated from self-reported data and is subject to a 3 percent margin of error.

In May 2020, responding businesses reported losses of:

Each of these figures mark a significant decrease from previous months. The inventory loss estimate is especially notable as it represents a 67 percent decrease when reported on a per firm basis. Income losses are 58 percent lower than May estimates on a per firm basis, but only 15 percent below April estimates. It is again important to note that May activity more closely resembles March in that businesses were able to operate more fully in roughly half of each month.

Most responding firms reported being open for business, with 14 percent needing additional resources to do so or deciding not to open. Five percent of responding firms also reported hiring staff in the past month. Many firms expect the losses attributed to the pandemic to continue through the remainder of 2020, with several firms reporting that losses are just beginning to appear.

“The June Business Impact Survey results illustrate a business community that is reopening,” Sachse added. “Like any economic shock or natural disaster, the early days of this process have brought a reassessment of conditions and plans to move forward. Responding businesses have proven extremely resilient but challenges remain in tourism-driven and customer-facing industries. The July survey results will present a clearer picture of business in this ‘new normal.’”

The July Business Impact Survey will be sent to responding businesses and partner organizations from July 1 to 12. The COVID-19 Business Impact Survey is a partnership of the Center for Customized Research and Services, the state’s nine Regional Development Organizations, and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.

2020-06-21|"It was early September last year and Roy Keane was in Dublin with Gary Neville for a gig at the Bord Gáis Energy Theatre, talking about their Manchester United glory years.

At the Marker Hotel, alongside the theatre, I was introduced to Keane a few hours before he went on stage. I’d never spoken to him before, but we got talking over a coffee. It was a chat, not an interview — that much was made clear. Very definitely not an interview.

The previous weekend, Dublin and Kerry had played out a draw in the All-Ireland football final. Had I been to the game, he asked? I told him I’d spent the day at Temple Street Hospital with my four-year-old after she’d broken her arm at the playground.

“That’s not a real injury,” he smiled. “She could have gotten the bus in herself.”

Coffee over, he autographed a white napkin from a table nearby for my son and said goodbye.

That week, I emailed his agent about a possible interview. It was politely declined . . . maybe some other time.

That usually means ‘never’, but every now and then this business can surprise you. Nine months later, locked down at home along with the rest of us, Keane had the time and the inclination to talk. We agreed to speak at 1pm the following day. He called right on the button.

It was a week before he returned — explosively — to a TV analyst role with Sky Sports, savaging Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea and defender Harry Maguire at half-time in Friday’s 1-1 draw at Tottenham. For many, the real talking point on the night was Keane, rather than the game.

But that was hardly a surprise, for he has always been box office.

Barry Egan: What’s the difference between Roy Keane, the football legend and Roy Keane, the man who walks his dog?

Roy Keane: I’m not into all this legend stuff. You put your boots on now and you’re a legend, particularly in Ireland. You play five games for Ireland and you’re a legend. You score one goal you’re a legend. Scratch your arse and you’re a legend.

When I was going to matches — and I had this throughout my career, going back to Rockmount — I was going to work . . . I was going to work. And I’d like to think I am a different person away from my job. I’m not saying it’s chalk and cheese. But I was going to earn a living, trying to help my team win a match.

At every level I have played, I was trying to win matches. Since I was eight years of age, I took football very, very seriously.

BE: Do you ever think about things like your legacy?

RK: Nah, listen. That’s certainly not something I would be comfortable with. That’s not my scene. If I had a bucket in front of me now, I’d be throwing up.

BE: If I told you that you couldn’t play, you’d be more comfortable.

RK: I’m more comfortable with criticism. You’re right.

RK: It keeps you on your toes.

BE: Did you get positive stuff from your family growing up?

RK: [Laughs] No, not really! Are you joking? I still haven’t got it. Christ almighty! It didn’t work that way, as you know. Typical Irish family. Just got on with it. My family will probably tell me that my three brothers were better players than me.

BE: And were they?

RK: I’d say so, yeah. They were very good players. They played at a very good level. And if they had the luck I had, it could have been them. Most sports people weren’t as good as they thought they were. I never won a trophy in my career at Man United or Celtic or Rockmount. The team did.

BE: Where did that come from?

RK: From eight years of age I played the game to win. Would I give that advice to kids now? Obviously not. But I played to win.

I was from a competitive family. I’m a Keane, but my mother’s a Lynch. Sport is in her family. I have sport running through my blood. So, along the way, I was going to push people. I had to.

A good old Irish friend said to me years ago, ‘Roy, you just need to lighten up a small bit.’ And I try. I try to lighten up. But regarding football, I couldn’t lighten up, because if I lightened up too much in football, I would never have got to England. And if I did, I wouldn’t have lasted two minutes.

I had to be intense. I had to train properly. I had to push myself. I had to push people around me. I don’t make apologies for that. That was who I was. Even pre-season, any game I ever took it easy in, I guarantee you I was the worst player on the park.

I couldn’t do it. I just couldn’t do it. It just wasn’t in my make-up. And sometimes that would rattle a few people, even in training. I’d go, ‘I can’t do it [take it easier]. I wish I could. I just can’t.’ I wish I had. You know when you want to let a bit of steam off? I couldn’t. If I thought, ‘We’ve no game for two weeks and my hamstring is a bit tight, I’ll just go easy’, I couldn’t do it. I had to be full pelt.

BE: Why was that?

RK: Fear. Fear of failure. Fear of letting people down. When I came to England, I had wanted to be a professional player for a long time. I wanted to win trophies. I wanted security for my family. I wanted a nice house. I wanted a nice holiday. I wanted a nice car.

BE: What are you frightened of now? Some people who have that fear earlier on in life, it just keeps transferring on to other fears.

RK: Not for me, thank God. It was that football bubble that I was in. There is no guarantee that I’ll be doing TV next year. There are no deals lined up. I’m speaking to one or two, [but] if none of these things fall into place I am actually quite relaxed. And maybe that’s because I am out of football now.

I have always loved the game. I don’t always like what goes on around the game. If people want to pigeonhole me and say, ‘He’s this or that, the legend stuff, or ‘he’s an oddball’ . . . listen, my job was to win football matches. And generally speaking, the teams I played with were all okay with my attitude to the game. Did I always get it right? I made mistakes, like everybody else.

BE: What mistakes did you make?

RK: Stuff like letting teammates down by getting sent off. Sometimes I would try and push them. Sometimes I was too hard. Sometimes I was too soft. If I was critical, looking back on my own career and how I dealt with people, even in management — and people mightn’t believe this — but I reckon that sometimes I was too nice to people.

RK: Absolutely, yeah. That was one of my weaknesses. Being too nice. I try and look after people. I try and please people. And you end up trying to please everyone, and we all know what happens to people who try to please everybody. You come unstuck. I had that in my career.

The bottom line is, I finished at 34 because of the injuries. The guilt is part of being a sportsperson. You play when you shouldn’t, not the other way around. I put my body on the line when really I should have been strong enough to say: ‘I’m not fit today. I’m not fit to train.’ I was constantly pushing myself. And you get criticised for missing games because you were injured. As I say, all the experts are out there.

There is always that element going on when you are in top level sport. Even dealing with managers or players, sometimes I turned a blind eye. I was too nice to them. And then eventually when people trust you and they think they’ve got . . . what’s the word I’m looking for? Eventually they think they can take the mick out of you. Obviously people stab you in the back. People stabbed me right in my chest, it wasn’t in my back. Because I was too nice to them.

BE: Who stabbed you in the chest?

RK: There’s plenty. There’s plenty. Plenty stabbed me right in the chest. People who I thought I trusted throughout my life, whether it be contract stuff, managers. People. That’s what they do. That’s the nature of the game we’re in, with football. I understand that. It’s tough going. You’re battling on the pitch. You’re battling off the pitch, whether it be injuries or contracts [or] the way people are treating you. And sometimes you have to put a front on.

Because of the position I played, in the middle of the park, people were hitting me. I was hitting them. Every time people talk about my career they talk about the people I tackled or hurt, forgetting obviously that I was hurt quite a number of times myself. But that’s the kind of game people play. That’s the deal. It’s give and take. But this idea that you’re working with good people all the time . . . I’ve been very, very lucky. Some of the best people in my life, the majority of people I know, are through football. But I met people as well who I still regret that I got involved with. A number of people. People I trusted.

RK: I’m talking about a number of people. Listen, don’t be putting words in my mouth here. I’m talking about a number of people here and not automatically just United. I have been involved with other clubs. And I have been involved with Ireland. And from a player’s point of view, I have been involved with off-field stuff, whether it be people doing contracts . . . whatever it might be. And there are a number of people who I look back now and go: ‘Shame. Shame on you.’

BE: Was it that much of a shock to you that a big corporation like Manchester United would treat you the way they did in the end?

RK: I didn’t say it was a shock. Where did I say it was shock? I never mentioned United. Put it this way: I’m certainly not the first or the last player to be treated badly by a club. I read that poor Tony Dunne passed away the other day and from what I hear and read, and I know you can’t believe everything, he was very disappointed with the way he was treated. So, again, I’m not the first. It doesn’t keep me awake at night.

BE: Is there anything that does?

RK: At the moment, no. No, no. Sleeping well.

BE: What about Covid-19?

RK: You know, I haven’t been too bad. I know people are suffering and it has been a huge setback. Obviously, I am very lucky. I was supposed to have some work, the usual stuff. I had the Euros coming up. But in terms of dealing with it and being in the house with the family and all, if I’m honest, I’ve enjoyed it. I’"|2

2020-06-21|"Nearly two weeks after Tropical Storm Cristobal forced high waters to move into our state’s coastal areas from lower Terrebonne areas east to Plaquemines, St. Bernard and eastern Orleans parishes, it appears fishing has returned to near normal catches. Then, last weekend’s strong east winds didn’t help.

The bugaboo now is the storm broke up the shrimp pods and made it more difficult for shrimpers to scratch out a living, and it also meant that fishermen aren’t finding the big schools of trout feeding on those shrimp.

That usually happens later in the summer (OK, so summer became official Saturday) after brown shrimp that haven’t been caught move to the coast and begin a westward migration towards Texas.

So, instead of sitting in one spot and hooking enough trout for a big family weekend feast, the best way to continue a morning’s fishing is to consider charting a plan to move from place to place to fill out a limit, whatever that means to an individual angler these days.

When the big piles of shrimp up, trout tend to break up, too. It means you’re not likely to find a motherlode of trout in any spot along a beach, or a cut, or a point or a platform, just because some of the trout that set up home in those places moved to follow the shrimp.

Yes, you can still find live shrimp at the baithouses, and you can find enough speckled trout to make a trip worth your while, but you’ll just have to work and stay out a little longer to do it.

With the black cloud of COVID-19 lingering, it was sad to learn this year’s Fourth of July Golden Meadow-Fourchon Tarpon Rodeo was canceled. Well, organizers said it was postponed until 2021. It joined the annual Swollfest Rodeo on the pandemic’s hit list.

Two other rodeos, Catholic High’s and Jesuit’s, took different approaches.

Jesuit’s annual rodeo begins Friday with weigh-in festivities set to begin at 2 p.m. Saturday (scales close at 4 p.m.) at the school’s John Ryan Stadium in Metairie.

Rodeo chairman Mike McMahon said the rodeo would be held “… in compliance with and subject to any CDC, state, and parish guidelines.”

JHS has five age-group and species-specific divisions, including a Father-Daughter Division, and categories for bass, flounder, black drum and redfish (both with a 16-to-27 inches restriction), speckled trout, redfish, sheepshead and red snapper categories.

For more info, call McMahon (504) 650-1700, or to register call Jeremy Reuther (504) 483-3813/email: reuther@jesuitnola.org.

Catholic High took the summer-long, virtual route to continue its run. After canceling its “live” rodeo in late May, the Alumni Fishing Rodeo crew decided on a “catch-measure-photo” summer-long event through Sept. 7 for its registered anglers.

There are Inshore and Offshore divisions with Youth and Adult “brackets” and largemouth bass has been added to the list including trout, redfish, flounder, blackfin and yellowfin tunas, cobia, wahoo, mangrove snapper, red snapper, grouper and bull dolphin.

Google “Catholic High Alumni Fishing Rodeo” for all rules and registration info.

After rolling up record-setting catches for the first two weekends of the private recreational red snapper season, it appears Tropical Storm Cristobal kept most anglers tied to docks.

After taking near 22% (169,270 pounds) of our state’s 784,332-pound allotment for 2020, the third weekend’s total dropped to 5,523 pounds for a three-week total of 174,793 pounds.

The recreational red snapper season opened in the Sunshine State last week and is scheduled to run through July 25. Florida gets the most of the annual recreational red snapper allotment, a fact that continues to baffle folks fishing in the western Gulf of Mexico.

There’s little debate about the weighty number of red snapper in the western gulf compared to eastern gulf waters, but the “booming” Florida charterboat business is one of the reasons the private recreational anglers had to take a cut from its 49% annual allowable catch (commercial operations get 51%) and turn it over to the federally permitted for-hire/charterboat industry.

That’s why, for western gulf anglers who have to fight off red snapper to catch other species, it’s laughable when Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said, “I’m pleased to announce that our state’s good conservation practices are allowing us to have a 45-day Gulf red snapper season this year. Gulf red snapper season is always an exciting time for anglers and is just another reason why Florida remains the Fishing Capital of the World.”

In the same announcement, you can believe all that “capital of the world” pronouncement, when you understand Florida is battling red tides and Florida’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission had to extend catch-and-release regulations on speckled trout, snook and redfish through May 31, 2021.

If you’ve been around south Louisiana bass fishing for the past 50 years, then you know who Gerald Rome was. He still is for most of us, although the Great Fisherman took our friend earlier this month. His heart just gave out.

Gerald’s finest moment on the water came near two decades ago when he caught a monster largemouth — about 12 pounds — from his beloved Atchafalaya Spilway. His stories could fill this entire sports page, and he will be missed mightily."|1

Moreover, the index remained at a record high at the time of writing, 14 May 2020.

The COVID-19 crisis has once again shown how important it is to be able to assess economic conditions in real time. Although it has been clear since early March that some economies are sliding into recession, until very recently the standard measures – based on low-frequency indicators with publication delays – were silent about the increasing probability of recession in most advanced and emerging economies.

In order to solve this problem, various researchers have developed non-linear models based on several timely indicators. Unlike many other models, the Markov-switching dynamic factor (MSDF) models introduced by Chauvet (1998) have been successfully used to account for co-movements and non-linearities across several economic indicators. These models have widely proven their ability to quickly identify turning points.

In MSDF models, the economy is assumed to switch between expansions and recessions with constant probabilities. Expansions and recessions are respectively characterised by high and low growth rates of the various activity indicators. Conditional on being in each state, the indicators, including GDP, move around these high/low growth rates. Following Hamilton (1989), previous MSDF models have assumed that these two growth rates are the same for all the expansions and recessions in the sample.

This article explains how we (Leiva-Leon et al. 2020) estimate such a model using timely indicators, while also allowing for recessions to differ in depth. To allow for this possibility has two advantages. First, allowing for the mean to vary across recessions is helpful because once an economy has suffered a ‘severe’ recession, such as the Global Crisis, the model might not be able to identify an upcoming ‘mild’ recession. This lack of sensitivity of the model comes from the fact that the estimated growth rate of recessions might be too low to capture ‘mild’ recession periods. Second, as the growth rate of every recession is different, the model delivers real-time estimates of the depth of every recession, which provides valuable information to rapidly design and implement the necessary policy responses. This is especially important in the deep COVID-19 recession that we are currently experiencing.

Data, sample and technical features of the model

An MSDF with recessions of varying depth is estimated independently for twelve of the largest economic regions of the world, which together account for more than 70% of world GDP. Six of them are advanced, while the rest are emerging economies:

We use supply-side variables (usually, industrial production), internal demand variables (imports or sales), external demand (exports) as well as one additional variable, specific to each economy, which is usually a soft indicator such as the PMI. All of these variables are measure at a monthly frequency. In addition, the models contain GDP as a quarterly variable.

The main advantage of relying exclusively on real variables is that we capture all types of recessions, whether they originate in the financial sector, energy prices, a pandemic or any other cause. Whatever is its origin, as long as there is an effect on the economy, the effect will be reflected in these variables.

For every economy, both the probabilities of recessions and the depth of every recession are endogenously estimated. No external dating is used. Figure 1 plots recession probabilities for the different regions on 2 March 2020, the first day in which the model captured a serious increase in global weakness, and on 14 May 2020, the day of the writing of this article.

Note: The heatmap of the world plots the overall pattern of the probabilities of the low economic activity regime for specific dates. The darker (lighter) the area, the higher (lower) the probability of recession. The animated sequence of world heatmaps, from April 2003 until February 2020 can be found here.

The information contained in Figure 1 can be summarised in an index – the Global Weakness Index (GWI). It is a weighted average of the probabilities of recession in different economies. The weights depend on the GDP of each region in every quarter. Figure 2 plots the GWI computed on the same dates shown in Figure 1. As the chart shows, there is a sharp increase as early as 2 March, which is confirmed by the latest numbers of 14 May, where the GWI ends up close to 1. The index can be interpreted as the proportion of the world economy that is currently in recession.

Note: The figure shows the Global Weakness Index, which is constructed as a weighted average of the probabilities of the low economic activity regime across economies. It is weighted by the size of the corresponding economies. The red area represents the credible set based on the 16th and 84th percentiles of the posterior distribution.

Given that the index is computed as a weighted average of the individual economies, it can be broken down by the individual contributors. Each economy’s contribution depends on the weight of that economy in world GDP and the probability of that economy being in a recession. The contribution of the different economic areas can be seen in Figure 3. It shows that, at the beginning of March, only China was clearly in a recession, but recently the US and the Euro area have also been large contributors to the high level of the index.

Note: The radar chart shows the relative contribution of each economy to the GWI. The contributions are normalised to sum up to one.

All in all, the GWI as an indicator has four key benefits. It is

3. Useful for quantifying risks; and

Our model includes GDP as one of its indicators, so it can be used to provide forecasts for GDP. As a matter of fact, computing the probability of negative growth or two quarters of negative growth, i.e. the probability of a recession according to its classical definition, is quite straightforward. In the case of the euro area, the latest figures suggest that the probability of a classical recession has reached 100%.

We present a new indicator of global economic weakness which uses real-time information available to estimate the proportion of the world economy that is in a recession. The indicator is based on the estimation of a dynamic non-linear factor model for individual economies which considers recessions of different depths. In our recent research, Leiva-Leon et al. (2020), we show the excellent real-time forecasting properties of this model for individual economies.

As this article illustrates, the indicator already pointed to clear signs of economic weakness as early as 2 March 2020. This weakness was confirmed by official statistics on 14 May 2020, when Q1 GDP data for most countries were released. Therefore, this indicator helps provide early warnings of a downturn that can be crucial for a fast policy response.

1 Indicators are transformed to be stationary. Depending on the indicators, they are used in growth rates, first differences or levels. GDP is included in growth rates but, given that the model is constructed in monthly frequencies, its relation to the factor is a weighted moving average of monthly activity.

2 This choice follows the original approach of Stock and Watson (1991), Chauvet and Piger (2008) or Camacho et al. (2018). These papers show that such a small set of variables reliably capture current conditions of the economy and comprise most of the information relevant for inferring recessions in real time.

The Labour Ministry has approved thousands of labourers to go to work in Taiwan, as the Covid-19 pandemic subsides.

""The ministry made a decision based on the health of workers. Taiwan has not had Covid-19 cases for a long while and it has respected preventive measures,"" MR Chatu Mongol Sonakul, the minister, told the media yesterday.

In Taiwan, Thai workers face a 14-day state quarantine and will be allowed to work on two-year contracts.

He said many ambassadors had asked Thailand to approve Thai workers to return to work in their countries.

""These countries see Thai labourers as hard-working, honest and strong. The government will make a decision taking into account the workers' health and safety,"" said the minister.

Suchat Pornchaiwiseskul, director-general of the Department of Employment, said the department plans to export over 50,000 labourers during June to September to Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Israel.

About 20,120 workers will be sent to Taiwan, and 3,818 to Japan.

The department will also send to South Korea 6,412 workers, to Malaysia 2,448 workers, to Singapore 2,934 workers and Israel 2,840 workers.

Meanwhile, there are 128,102 Thai migrant labourers still overseas mostly in Taiwan. The second major group is in the Middle East, mainly Israel, followed by Europe and the African continent, especially in South Africa."|0
2020-06-21|"Women leaders are better at fighting the pandemic

The effectiveness of female leaders in handling the COVID crisis has received a lot of media attention. This column examines whether the gender of the national leader truly makes a significant difference to the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the first quarter of the pandemic, with differences in lockdown timing examined as a plausible explanation for these patterns. The findings show that COVID outcomes are systematically better in countries led by women. Insights from behavioural studies and leadership literature are used to speculate on the sources of these differences, as well as on their implications.

On 8 June 2020, New Zealand was declared virus-free and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern lifted all restrictions except stringent border controls (Graham-McLay 2020). With fewer than 500 confirmed cases and seven deaths from the virus, Taiwan under the presidency of Tsai Ing-Wen is seen to have performed very well. Germany under Angela Merkel has done better than most European countries in the first quarter of the COVID pandemic (Hartl et al. 2020). The performance of these female leaders in the COVID pandemic offers a unique global experiment in national crisis management and has given rise to much media attention. This is a significant shift from the male-dominated view of history within which events are typically considered as determined by the instrumental and causal influence of a small number of ‘Great Men’ (e.g. Keegan 2003). But does this association stand up to systematic scrutiny?

Leader’s gender in the fight against the pandemic

In a new paper (Garikipati and Kambhampati 2020), we consider whether there are significant differences in the COVID-outcomes of male and female led-countries in the first quarter of the pandemic. We also consider whether these differences can be explained by differences in policy measures adopted by male and female leaders. In particular, we consider the timing of lockdown in these countries.

Anything said about the pandemic now has to be qualified by the fact that we are only at the start of the pandemic. Much could change in the next few months. Our analysis therefore relates to the immediate reaction of leaders to the first wave of the crisis. Another qualification to keep in mind is the quality of data currently available. In particular, with the shortage of test kits, testing has been poor (Baunez et al. 2020) and therefore case numbers are an underestimate. While data on deaths are more reliable, there are concerns about its comparability across countries. In some countries, if a COVID-positive individual dies, the death is registered as a COVID death irrespective of any other previous illness (such as tuberculosis or cancer). But this is not standard or mandatory, so practice varies across countries.

We begin by looking at some summary statistics. Table 1 presents COVID-19 cases and deaths by gender of the country’s leaders. It confirms that female-led countries have fared better in terms of absolute number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, with male-led countries having nearly double the number of deaths as female-led ones. However, drawing anything conclusive from these raw comparisons is difficult due to the massive underrepresentation of female-led countries in the sample. We have only 19 countries across the world being led by women, compared with the 174 in our sample that are male-led.

Table 1 COVID-19 cases and deaths in countries by gender of national leader

Source: Dataset constructed by authors from various sources.

To overcome the difficulty of imbalanced sample sizes, we ‘match’ each of the female-led countries with their nearest neighbour. We use several socio-demographic and economic characteristics that have been seen as important in the transmission of COVID-19 as matching variables. We begin by considering key demographic and national wealth indicators (including GDP, population over 65 years, and population in urban agglomerations) as these have emerged as the most relevant (Sá 2020). Figure 1 below illustrates some examples of comparing COVID-19 cases and deaths in female-led countries with their near neighbour matched by size of population. When matched like this, it is clear that female-led countries have fewer cases and fewer deaths and have locked down earlier than male countries with respect to cases and deaths. Following discussions in the literature, we also extend matching to include other variables such as expenditure on health and tourism. We also include gender equality as a matching variable as having equitable institutions may contribute to a general resilience that becomes confounded with having a female leader.

Nearest neighbour analysis clearly confirms that when women-led countries are compared to countries similar to them along a range of characteristics, they have performed better, experiencing fewer cases as well as fewer deaths. This is true whether we consider the nearest neighbour, the nearest two, three or even five neighbours. The results are especially highly significant in the case of the number of deaths experienced by female-led countries. These results remain robust when we drop countries that have been in the COVID spotlight – the US, Germany, and New Zealand – from our sample to see if they might be driving the results. We find that these changes in the sample only strengthen the results.

What is also clear from our analysis is that timing of lockdown has been driving the better outcomes in female-led countries. Female-led countries locked down significantly earlier, i.e. when they were seeing fewer deaths (22 fewer) than male-led countries. Our nearest neighbour matching estimates confirm this result at a very high level of significance. While this may have longer-term economic implications, it has certainly helped these countries to save lives (Assenza et al. 2020). Why have women leaders decided to lock down their countries earlier than male leaders?

Figure 1 COVID-19 cases and deaths: Comparing female-led and male-led countries with similar populations

Source: COVID-19 cases and deaths extracted from the Worldometer website (https://www.worldometers.info/)

One explanation for gender-differences in the propensity to lock down early might be found in the literature on attitudes to risk and uncertainty, which suggests that women, even those in leadership roles, appear to be more risk-averse than men (e.g. Croson and Gneezy 2009, Charness and Gneezy 2012). Indeed, in the current crisis, several incidents of risky behaviour by male leaders have been reported. Particularly noteworthy among these are Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro’s dismissal of COVID-19 as “a little flu or a bit of a cold” (Ajzenman et al. 2020) while attending an anti-lockdown protest in April. Similarly, Britain’s Boris Johnson is reported to have said, “I was at a hospital where there were a few coronavirus patients and I shook hands with everybody” (as reported in Lewis 2020).

However, while women leaders were risk averse with regard to lives, they were prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early. Thus, risk aversion may manifest differently in different domains – human life versus economic outcomes – with women leaders being significantly more risk averse in the domain of human life, but more risk taking in the domain of the economy. We find some support for this idea in studies that examine risk taking behaviour when lotteries are framed as losses. Men are found to be more risk averse than women when lotteries are framed as financial losses rather than gains (Schubert et al. 1999, Moore and Eckel 2006). It could well be that the relatively late lockdown decisions by male leaders may reflect male risk aversion to anticipated losses from locking down the economy.

The neuroscience literature also throws light on sex-differences in feelings of empathy which cannot be fully explained as cultural derivatives of socialisation alone but have deeper neurobiological drivers (Eckel and Grossman 2002). There exist quantitative gender differences in the basic networks involved in affective and cognitive forms of empathy, as well as a qualitative divergence between the sexes in how emotional information is integrated to support decision making processes (Christov-Moore et al. 2014). When combined with the findings from the risk literature, we begin to see how women leaders could have been risk-averse about anticipated losses to human life, while at the same time taking risk with negative financial outcomes associated with early lockdown.

Another explanation of gender differences in response to the pandemic is to be found in the leadership literature, where strong evidence can be found to suggest that men and women differ in their leadership styles. Eagly and Johnson (1990), through a meta-analysis of research that compares male and female leadership styles, find that leadership styles were gender stereotypic, with men likely to lead in a ‘task-oriented’ style and women in an ‘interpersonally oriented’ manner. Consistent with this finding, women tended to adopt a more democratic and participative style. Evidence also suggests that good communications skills are important for women to be chosen as leaders and that this is one of the key attributes in managing a crisis (Lemoine et al. 2016).

Indeed, the decisive and clear communication styles adopted by several female leaders have received much praise in the ongoing crisis (e.g. Henley and Roy 2020, McLean 2020, Taub 2020). Thus, in Norway Prime Minister Erna Solberg spoke direct to children answering their questions, while in New Zealand Prime Minster Ardern was praised for the way in which she communicated and for checking in with her citizens through Facebook Live.

2020-06-21|"Ben Lowe and Sam Hartigan were keenly aware of the bit parts they had been assigned in the drama in which their wives, about to give birth, were the stars and both clearly understood what they were missing out on as their partners were led off to the wards to go through the early stages of labour without them.

Covid-19 restrictions in place in the National Maternity Hospital – and other maternity units across the State – have meant that for more than three months some 2,000 fathers have been unable to spend much time with their partners in the lead-up to new arrivals and even less time with their babies once they have come kicking and screaming into the world.

But both of these fathers knew their absence was a price worth paying to keep their babies, their partners and those caring for them safe from harm.

The drama for the Lowes and the Hartigans started early on Monday morning.

“Sorcha’s waters broke so we rushed into hospital, but when got there at around 6am we were told she wasn’t in active labour so she was diverted to an antenatal ward and I was told to go home,” Sam Hartigan recalled.

He returned to their home in Dún Laoghaire, and less than three hours later a call came from a hospital midwife that it was time. “I was back at 9.30am and Eli was born shortly after 2pm.”

Eli is the couple’s first child and while they don’t have anything to compare the birth experience to, Sam is acutely aware things were not normal. “The experience was definitely different to what it would have been pre-Covid,” he said.

“I’d just over an hour with Eli before I had to go. That was tough. I went home and thought I might get some sleep but I just couldn’t, I was buzzing and pacing around. I didn’t know what to do with myself.”

It was the middle of the week when he spoke to The Irish Times and he already had plans for his first Father’s Day.

“I’ve everything ready. The room is all set up and the car seat is locked and loaded. I wish they were home.” Within hours his wish had been granted and the small family unit were together.

The Lowes’ story started in a similar fashion. “We woke up at 5am on Monday and Tracy was having contractions so we raced into Holles Street,” Ben said. “I was allowed to stay to get her checked in but then they said she wasn’t in active labour so I had to leave. We live in Wicklow town and the midwife advised me against going too far.”

So he sat in the car for 30 minutes and exchanged multiple texts with Tracey. “It was very frustrating to not be by her side even though when our son Michael was born seven years ago I did feel a bit useless, like, I’d say, most men do.”

After waiting in the car for a bit he decided to go for a stroll; a long, long stroll. He clocked up thousands of steps over more than four hours walking around the Dublin city centre block. “I just tried to keep my mind off things. I felt like she was in there all on her own even though I knew she was surrounded by these great midwives.”

The couple continued to exchange text messages until 11.30am when Tracey went silent. “I stopped getting messages,” he said. “I think I sent at least four she didn’t respond to and I was convinced then she’d already had the baba. I was terrified the hospital had the wrong number for me and couldn’t reach me. Then I got a call from the midwife, Caroline.

“She was amazing. I happened to be just outside the front door and when I walked into the hospital, I passed five hand sanitiser dispensers and used every one of them. I didn’t take a lift as I was afraid I’d have to touch something and didn’t open any doors with my hands or hold banisters. I was just terrified I’d bring something in with me.”

He wasn’t even in the labour suite for 40 minutes before he was cradling his daughter Eleanor. “We’d a few minutes to ourselves, just the three of us and that was great, amazing, but then around half an hour later they were moved to the ward and I had to say my goodbyes. That was very hard but I’m in no way angry. The procedures are there to keep everyone safe.”

He predicted he would be having a different Father’s Day this year. “My wife will tell you I really milk Father’s Day. It’s nearly father’s month for us and I’d normally be pleading for a lie-in. It won’t be like that this year for sure. There’ll be no lie-ins.”"|1

Here’s a simple idea for a show: take one chair, put a wise person sitting in it, and watch as they deliver their insights gleaned from a lifetime of experience. Never mind all that elaborate Love Island and X Factor stuff. All you need is a nice, comfy chair to sit your erudite guest in, and let them do the rest. But not just any old chair – this one is hand-made by Westmeath craftsman Jason Robards. First up in the cathaoir is veteran broadcaster Micheál Ó Muircheartaigh, who reminisces about his long career commentating on GAA matches. He recalls the time he first set foot on the grounds of Croke Park, at the 1948 All-Ireland final, and muses on the many great players he’s met along the way, including Christy Ring and Jack Lynch.

Creating any drama during lockdown has been a challenge for the TV industry, but one beloved series from years gone by seems custom-made for 2020. With some of the best acting talent around, including Jodie Comer, Lesley Manville, Kristin Scott-Thomas and Martin Freeman, now is the chance to see these minimalistic tales revamped for a new generation. In the first of a double bill, Imelda Staunton performs A Lady of Letters, the tale of a woman who compulsively spies on her neighbours. That’s followed by An Ordinary Woman, the story of a mother who finds herself developing incestuous desires for her own 15-year-old son. Sarah Lancashire stars.

It was the COVID-19 pandemic that saw the Belmont, usually the final race in U.S. flat racing's flagship treble after the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, run first for the first time in history.

The race, long dubbed the Test of the Champion, was also shortened from its usual 1 1/2-mile distance to 1 1/8 -- a nod to the difficulty of getting the 3-year-old contenders in proper condition for the longer distance in the pandemic-disrupted year.

Tiz the Law broke smartly from the eighth post in a field of 10 and settled into third place behind pace-setter Tap It to Win down the backstretch of the sweeping Belmont track known as ""Big Sandy.""

Franco made his move in the lone turn, surging ahead on the outside and powering home ahead of the Todd Pletcher-trained Dr Post with Irad Ortiz aboard. Max Player, trained by Linda Rice and ridden by Joel Rosario, was third.

The Triple Crown will continue with the Kentucky Derby, usually held on the first Saturday in May, and now rescheduled for September 5 at Churchill Downs. The Preakness at Pimlico, usually the middle jewel of the Triple Crown, is scheduled for October 3."|2
2020-06-20|"A major Marvel scheduling clash at Sydney's Fox Studios could push the already-postponed Thor: Love and Thunder film release date even further back, according to Courier Mail.

In March, filming of Shing-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (also a Marvel movie), was forced to a halt when COVID-19 lockdown rules took hold.

As a result, the Chris Hemsworth-led superhero movie will no longer be able to start filming in September as scheduled.

According to the Courier Mail, Marvel distributors Disney are looking to relocate the set interstate, or overseas in a bid to meet it's late 2022 deadline.

'The thing with Marvel films is they have a sequence of films set up for at least the next five years, and all of the storylines are connected,' a source told the publication.

'So they have to keep production and release all on a tight schedule. If one release gets pushed back, then they all go back, and that's when things get messy.'

In April, Daily Mail Australia revealed that pre-production of the film was suspended and all Fox Studios staff were forced to work from home.

'Nothing is being filmed at the moment, our production offices are empty,' they said at the time.

Back in February, it was revealed Marvel Studios took over the entire backlot of the Sydney studios, forcing other local productions, including The Voice Australia and The Masked singer to film at other locations.

The New South Wales Minister for the Arts' office has confirmed Create NSW, which assisted in funding the project, was still waiting on 'decisions from the United States' to make a call about the film.

It's also understood American actress Natalie Portman was due to fly Down Under end of April to begin work on the upcoming blockbuster.

But after the pre-production of the film was suspended, the 39-year-old actress' trip to Sydney was also canned.

Meanwhile, the film's lead actor, Chris Hemsworth has been holed up in his Byron Bay mansion with his family until a decision about the film has been made."|1
2020-06-20|"LSU has begun asking a number of football players to self-quarantine in the past week because of instances in which some players tested positive for COVID-19 after social interactions outside of the Tigers’ training facility.

“This is what we anticipated. We planned for this. Our plan is working the way it should,” Senior Associate Athletic Director of Health and Wellness Shelly Mullenix told The Associated Press on Saturday, adding that none of the players have exhibited “significant” symptoms.

“We haven’t seen anything even close to a bad illness, but we’re prepared for that,” Mullenix said. “What we have right now is quite manageable.”

Mullenix declined to specify the number of players who’ve tested positive for COVID-19 or the precise number of those asked to quarantine, stressing that the number is fluid and can fluctuate considerable in short periods of time. But she emphasized that a single positive test could result in as many as 12 to 15 players being asked to initially quarantine because of LSU’s contact tracing procedures. Several media reports have attributing specific numbers to unnamed sources, but Mullenix called those numbers “inaccurate.”

“If our quarantine number is high, it means our players have been communicating not only where they’ve been and who’ve they’ve been with, but also their symptoms, as we instructed them to,” Mullenix said.

Some schools have released figures on COVID-19 testing. On Friday, Clemson said 28 athletes or staff members have tested positive since returning to campus June 8. Last weekend, Louisiana Tech said it had one positive test.

Mullenix said LSU has been working closely with state health officials who would be able to suggest that the football program make changes or even halt workouts at its Baton Rouge, Louisiana, campus if they saw a need for that.

“We’re fortunate in what we’re seeing,” Mullenix said. “If they were to ask us to close down, that would be evidence that we’ve crossed some threshold that’s too difficult to manage.”

LSU players began reporting to the on-campus training facility during the first week in June for antibody testing and physicals.

Strength training and conditioning began the following week with social distancing rules that limited the number of players in the weight room to 20 at a time at regularly sanitized and spaced-apart racks. Each rack contains all weights needed for the day’s workout, so there’s no need for players to cross paths or take turns using the same equipment. The racks are sanitized between each use and LSU also has set up machines like those in hospitals which circulate air through virus-killing ultraviolet light.

Also, players must answer a series of questions and have their temperature scanned before they may enter the facility.

“We’re monitoring it on a daily basis,” Mullenix said. “We’re catching people (with temperature or symptoms) where we want to catch them, right at the entrance, and we’re able to quarantine people before they even get into the facility.”

Mullenix said LSU’s combination of testing for antibodies and active disease, as well as contact tracing, has enabled the university to virtually rule out transmission occurring at on-campus football facilities.

But she noted that LSU always expected at least some players and possibly coaches to contract the virus throughout the year, particularly as they go about their lives outside of football.

“It’s a pandemic; by definition, it would have been foolish to think it wouldn’t happen,” she said, but added, “If these cases are accounted for, then there’s control, which is different than if you had a bunch of cases popping up and had no idea where they were coming from.

“We’ve limited community spread, slowed down spread through the team,” she added. “It’s a slow, controlled burn. The curve is flat and that’s what you want.""

LSU, the defending national champion, is scheduled to open the season Sept. 5 against UTSA in Tiger Stadium.

2020-06-20|"HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C.—The PGA Tour’s return to competition has brought together the strongest fields of the year on courses that have not been overly punishing, and the result is the same.

It’s another free-for-all at the RBC Heritage.

Webb Simpson practically had to apologize for a 3-under 68, in which he managed just one birdie on the back nine. He was part of a four-way tie for the lead, and that was good enough for him. He also knows good probably won’t cut it Sunday at Harbour Town.

“It’s not like I’ve got a three- or four-shot lead and could shoot a couple under,” he said. “It’s going to take a good one.”

Tyrrell Hatton had one of six rounds at 63, giving the 28-year-old from England a share of the lead as he goes for his second straight victory, albeit three months apart because of the shutdown from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Abraham Ancer, so solid with his irons, had a 65 and joined the lead along with Ryan Palmer, who had a 66.

They were at 15-under 198, a number that didn’t even start to explain the low scoring.

Even with Jordan Spieth and Xander Schauffele sputtering to 75s, the field was 223-under par, the lowest for any round since the RBC Heritage began in 1969. There were 35 players at 10 under or better — including Canadians Corey Conners (-13) and Mackenzie Hughes (-10) — compared with only one player a year ago. The previous mark was seven players at double digits under par through 54 holes.

There were 21 players separated by just three shots going into the final round. A week ago at Colonial, there were 14 players separated by three shots.

“I think the fields have been extremely strong,” Ancer said. “Everybody out here was just eager to come out and play. The greens are a little bit soft, especially this week, and the ball isn’t really rolling out as much as you’re used to on the greens and on the fairways. That’s yielding a little bit more birdies, for sure.”

Carlos Ortiz, who started this tournament with two double bogeys after playing only five holes, suddenly has a chance to grab his first PGA Tour victory after two eagles in a round of 63. He was one shot behind, along with Colonial winner Daniel Berger and Joel Dahmen, both with 63s.

And there was more testing than usual.

Players and caddies on the charter flight to Connecticut for next week’s event had to take a saliva test Saturday for the coronavirus before they can get on the plane. Eleven others had testing Friday night because they were deemed to have been in close contact with Nick Watney, whose positive test on Friday was the first in golf’s return.

Among them was Sergio Garcia, who flew with Watney from Austin, Texas. The initial test was negative. Garcia was nervous as he waited for the result, though not so nervous he couldn’t put down a 65 to join the chase. He was two shots behind, along with Ian Poulter and Joaquin Niemann.

Bryson DeChambeau, starting the day one shot behind, hit his approach into the par-5 second in the trees and it never came down. He has added 40 pounds of mass, still not enough to uproot the tree and shake it loose. That led to a bogey, and more damaging was no birdies on the back nine for a 70.

Even so, he remained three shots behind in a group that included Johnson, who birdied three of his last four holes to go from around the middle of the pack to 12-under 201, three shots behind and very much in the picture. That’s all it took Saturday, and it likely won’t be any different in the final round.

Brooks Koepka quietly posted a 68 and was in the group three shots behind.

Chalk it up to June, a new date for the RBC Heritage because of the pandemic. The tournament usually is the week after the Masters in April, when the temperature is slightly cooler, the greens are firmer and the rye grass hasn’t been taken over by Bermuda. It’s soft. And these are the best players in the world, all of them eager to get going again.

“Because we’re not at a major championship-style golf course last week or this week, where you’re going to have separation because of bad scores, I think that’s probably why,” Simpson said when asked to explain the bunched score.

Perhaps that explains why Justin Thomas called it “the worst 66 I’ve ever shot in my life.”

Hatton has won back-to-back before in his career, under entirely different circumstances. In 2017, he won in Scotland and Italy in consecutive weeks. Now, he goes after two in a row three months apart, having won at Bay Hill in March before the pandemic shut down sports.

It apparently wasn’t long enough for anyone to accumulate much rush.

“I think we’ve all had enough notice to try and get ready to play tournaments again,” said Hatton, who rented a house in Orlando, Fla., during the stay-at-home mandate. “So it’s not massively surprising to see guys playing as well as they are, and hopefully, the guys at home are enjoying it, watching on TV.”"|2
2020-06-20|"President Trump roared back onto the campaign trail Saturday night with a rally before thousands of supporters in Tulsa, Okla., using the fiery and freewheeling appearance to mock Democratic foe Joe Biden, criticize those tearing down monuments to controversial historical figures and decry what he described as the “disaster” demonstration in Seattle.

The rally, his first in months, comes amid prolonged concerns about the coronavirus pandemic and a nationwide outcry over racial injustice in the wake of George Floyd's death. Before an enthusiastic and placard-waving crowd -- in an arena that still had visible empty seats despite expectations of a packed house -- Trump described his party as one of equality and justice but also hammered a ""law and order"" message in response to those protests that escalated into violence.

Trump specifically tore into the occupation of several blocks in Seattle by left-wing protesters, which covers an abandoned police precinct, saying it is an example of the ""radical left."" The occupants, whom Trump described as ""anarchists,"" call their area the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest, or CHOP.

""We're not talking about some little place, we're talking about Seattle,"" Trump said, criticizing the Democratic officials in Seattle and Washington state. He said he had a standing offer that ""any time you want, we'll come in"" and straighten out the issues in Seattle ""in an hour or less.""

But, he said: ""I may be wrong, but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster.""

Trump added that a congressman on the flight to the rally told him he shouldn't step in to end the CHOP occupation in order to let people see ""what radical left Democrats will do to our country.""

He also cited ""radicals"" that targeted statues of Thomas Jefferson and Christopher Columbus in recent days and said that a law should be passed that burning the American flag results in a year in jail. While touting his chances in November, Trump repeatedly used examples of protesters tearing down monuments and the Seattle CHOP zone as a foil for his “law and order” theme -- while insisting Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, would always ""cave"" to such ""radical"" parts of his party.

“Do you want to bow before the left-wing mob or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans?” he asked at one point.

The rally's scathing tone, impromptu digressions and political broadsides reflected Trump slipping right back into his campaign element after the pandemic-induced hiatus. Trump also called a Boeing official a “dumb son of a b----,” in describing defense contract negotiations with the company. He said he eventually saved “like a billion six or a billion seven” in the negotiation.

Tulsa marked the president's first rally since early March, when both Trump and Biden canceled in-person campaign events as the seriousness of the coronavirus crisis began to set in. But Trump, who for months has been itching to get the country's economy back to normal and get himself back in front of supporters at his rallies, is the first to resume large in-person events.

Trump also claimed Saturday that the ""silent majority is stronger than ever"" and touted Republicans as the ""party of Abraham Lincoln"" and ""law and order,"" in comments appearing to indicate how he will frame his reelection campaign as the November election approaches.

Trump made the declarations at Tulsa's BOK Center -- which itself became an epicenter of controversy amid protests outside and lingering concerns over the potential coronavirus risk of holding the rally.

In advance of the Saturday event, Trump supporters had been lining up for days to secure their seat in an arena that holds just under 20,000, and the Trump campaign touted Monday receiving over 1 million ticket requests.

Nevertheless, there were a number of empty seats on the upper levels inside. The campaign nixed plans for Trump to address an overflow crowd at the beginning. In the arena, Trump accused the media of dissuading would-be participants. Campaign manager Brad Parscale, on Twitter, said, ""Radical protestors, fueled by a week of apocalyptic media coverage, interfered with @realDonaldTrump supporters at the rally.""

But Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. -- a frequent Trump target during the rally -- tweeted in response that ""teens on TikTok"" had made ""fake ticket reservations & tricked you into believing a million people wanted your white supremacist open mic enough to pack an arena during COVID.""

But the rally, despite the hiatus, hit the familiar notes.

Trump early in his remarks touted reform to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the breakneck pace at which the Senate has confirmed his judicial nominees and tax cut legislation he signed into law.

""I stand before you today to declare that the silent majority is stronger than ever before,"" Trump told the raucous crowd. ""Five months from now we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden... We're going to stop the radical left. We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity ... Republicans are the party of liberty, equality and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order.""

Like in 2016, Trump promised that he will release a list of names he could potentially choose from for Supreme Court nominees earlier this week, and reiterated the promise Saturday night.

""Think how important it is... It's almost like we're a minority court,"" Trump said, referencing two rulings that went against the positions his administration took this week.

""I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates"" for the Supreme Court, he continued. ""And I'll only pick from that list.""

Trump said Biden could not release his own Supreme Court list because his possible nominees would be too radical. He also said that Biden would ""stack"" the tribunal with ""extremists.""

Additionally, Trump spent a significant amount of time addressing criticism he got for what appeared to be a gingerly walk down a ramp and an awkward sip from a glass of water at a West Point graduation earlier this month. Trump defended himself, alluded that Joe Biden had health issues instead of himself, then took a sip of water to loud cheers from the crowd, before tossing the water out of the glass.

""That's enough, I wanted to tell that story, does everybody understand that story?"" the president concluded.

OKLAHOMA SUPREME COURT ALLOWS TRUMP RALLY TO PROCEED AS PLANNED; TULSA MAYOR RESCINDS CURFEW

Trump also targeted China over trade concerns and the coronavirus. He said that his trade efforts helped American farmers and at one point called the coronavirus the ""Kung Flu.""

Trump also criticized Biden for not agreeing with his decision in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic to close off travel from the country. ""He never did anything against China, Joe Biden,"" Trump said.

The president, in comments on the South Lawn of the White House on Saturday, said he was excited to get back among his supporters.

""The event in Oklahoma is unbelievable,"" he said. ""The crowds are unbelievable, they haven't seen anything like it and we will go there now, we'll give a hopefully good speech, we're gonna see a lot of great people, a lot of great friends and pretty much that's it.""

With states reopening after historic economic lockdowns, the rally still raised concerns that it could be a ""super spreader"" event, especially as six members of the Trump reelection campaign tested positive for the coronavirus ahead of the event.

TRUMP PREPARES FOR FIRST CAMPAIGN RALLY IN MONTHS IN TULSA AMID CONCERNS ABOUT CORONAVIRUS, VIOLENCE

""Per safety protocols, campaign staff are tested for COVID-19 before events,"" Trump campaign Communications Director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement. ""Six members of the advance team tested positive out of hundreds of tests performed, and quarantine procedures were immediately implemented. No COVID-positive staffers or anyone in immediate contact will be at today’s rally or near attendees and elected officials. As previously announced, all rally attendees are given temperature checks before going through security, at which point they are given wristbands, facemasks and hand sanitizer.""

The campaign believes the staffers were infected in Dallas at the Trump event there. All six are said to be asymptomatic and the campaign is working with health authorities to contact trace the staffers who tested positive.

Biden in a Saturday evening tweet slammed Trump for holding the rally despite the coronavirus concerns -- Oklahoma has seen a recent bump in cases of the disease.

TULSA ARENA ASKS TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOR WRITTEN COVID-19 MITIGATION PLAN AHEAD OF RALLY

""Donald Trump is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he’s willing to put people at risk and violate CDC guidelines — as long as they sign a waiver promising not to hold his campaign liable. Unbelievable,"" Biden tweeted.

This followed the BOK Center asking the Trump campaign this week for a written plan on how it would engage in social distancing among the rally-goers. The Trump campaign appeared to dismiss the arena's concerns, making clear that the event would be an on-brand Trump rally.

""We take safety seriously, which is why we’re doing temperature checks for everyone attending, and providing masks and hand sanitizer. This will be a Trump rally, which means a big, boisterous, excited crowd,"" Murtaugh said in a statement.

The Saturday rally was originally scheduled for Friday, June 19. But that day is the Juneteenth holiday, which celebrates the end of slavery in the United States. Amid racial tensions over the death of George Floyd, the Trump campaign changed the date of the event to Saturday.

2020-06-22|"The COVID-19 pandemic is the biggest public-health crisis in a century, and the development of medical interventions to combat the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is a top priority. Writing in Nature, Pinto et al.1 provide evidence needed to take one of the crucial first steps for such efforts in the developing arena of antibody immunotherapy.

Read the paper: Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody

The level of protection provided by the immune system in response to SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection is a hotly debated topic2. It is thought that one major arm of the immune response to such infection is the development of antibodies that recognize the virus. Of particular interest are antibodies that bind to a protein on the viral surface known as the spike protein. Coronaviruses derive their name from their distinctive, crown-like (coronal) viral silhouettes, which are due to these proteins.

Antibodies that recognize and bind to the viral ‘spike’ can block its ability to bind the ACE2 receptor protein on human cells. An interaction between the spike protein and ACE2 is part of a process that can enable coronaviruses to enter human cells. Thus, antibodies that could hinder spike-protein function would block infection; such antibodies are termed neutralizing antibodies.

Much remains to be learnt about the immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, it is becoming clear that antibodies taken from the blood serum of people who have recovered from COVID-19 can be used for treatment by being transfused into other people who have the disease3. Such ‘convalescent sera’ approaches are highly attractive, particularly as an immediate treatment option. That’s because more-conventional therapeutics, such as drugs or vaccines, are unlikely to be available for some time. A more high-tech approach to using convalescent sera is the manipulation of antibody-producing B cells taken from the blood of people who had COVID-19 or other coronavirus infections. Each B cell makes one unique antibody, and clonal populations of a B cell of interest can be used to generate an identical pool of a particular desired antibody known as a monoclonal antibody.

To accelerate the process of therapeutic development, Pinto and colleagues ‘went back in time’, and turned to samples of B cells collected from a person who had been infected by the coronavirus SARS-CoV. This virus, which is similar to SARS-CoV-2, caused an outbreak in 2003 of a disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The hope with such an approach is that the resemblance between the two viruses might mean that some antibodies that recognize SARS-CoV also recognize and neutralize SARS-CoV-2.

The ‘head’, or receptor-binding domain (termed S1), of the spike protein is the most accessible region of the protein for antibodies to bind to. However, this domain exists in different dynamic states, and debate has arisen over whether it is ‘masked’ from the immune system by a shell of carbohydrate molecules4. The identification of a functional antibody that targets this region is therefore not a trivial process. Pinto et al. combined blood cells taken in 2004 and 2013 from a person who had recovered from SARS, and searched for antibodies that could recognize SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1). Of the 25 different monoclonal antibodies that the authors studied, 4 recognized the receptor-binding domains of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. One antibody, termed S309, was selected for further study on the basis of its high-affinity binding to this domain when tested in vitro.

Pinto and colleagues used cryo-electron microscopy to visualize the interaction between the S309 antibody and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This revealed that S309 binds to an accessible site in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein that has an attached carbohydrate molecule. This region is not part of the key area that directly binds to ACE2. The site that S309 recognizes is evolutionarily conserved in spike proteins across a range of bat coronaviruses (in the genus Betacoronavirus lineage B; subgenus Sarbecovirus) that have similarities to the SARS-like coronaviruses. This raises the possibility that such an antibody could have wide applicability in tackling related viruses. Not only, then, is this antibody of interest when investigating ways to manage the COVID-19 pandemic in the years ahead, but it might also be considered for use in preventing future outbreaks of related animal viruses, if they make the leap to causing infection in humans.

Read the paper: Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody

Ultimately, it seems unlikely that a robust treatment for COVID-19 will rely on a single antibody. Rather, as was the case for SARS, a synergistic approach combining different monoclonal antibodies in an antibody cocktail might be more effective5. For such approaches to move forwards, evidence of effective antibody neutralization from in vitro studies will be needed, along with in vivo data assessing how well an antibody can boost other aspects of the immune response — by enlisting other immune cells to tackle the infection, for example. There are many promising avenues to explore in these efforts.

Pinto and colleagues got a head start with their work by exploring pre-existing antibodies, and they should now have more B-cell populations to mine. Many other teams, to give just some examples2,6–13, have also presented useful discoveries in the hunt for antibodies that can target SARS-CoV-2. The next steps will be to test individual antibodies and antibody cocktails in animal models, to determine whether they offer protection, and then to assess their safety and effectiveness in human clinical trials. An accelerated path might narrow the time lag between antibody discovery and proof-of-concept trials in humans to as little as five or six months14.

The most recent prominent example of immunotherapy for infectious disease relates to battling the Ebola virus. In concert with vaccines and conventional, small-molecule-drug trials, the development of monoclonal-antibody therapies for Ebola has progressed rapidly. Cocktails of antibodies, beginning with one called ZMapp, that target a key Ebola viral protein called GP in two crucial regions of the protein, are continuing to be developed15–17. This progress in efforts to tackle Ebola gives hope for similar immunotherapy achievements in targeting SARS-CoV-2. Pinto and colleagues’ work marks a major step towards that much-anticipated, and much-needed, success."|2

 According to MondoMobileWeb, Hedberg also said that local authorities in Italy could be doing more to support operators as they deploy new infrastructure, drawing attention to some mayors giving in to pressure from anti-5G protest movements. The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) declared 5G technology safe in March this year.

2020-06-22|"At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was hoped that warm weather and younger populations would shield many developing countries from the virus. This hope has not been in realised. Infected cases in Africa, South Asia and Latin America are still growing, with Latin America having surpassed the number of cases in Europe and growing rapidly. This column introduces a new eBook that describes the early work focusing on developing and emerging markets. It concludes that the international community should step up, by providing aid, technical assistance and debt relief so that countries will not need to decide between saving lives and servicing their debts.

The COVID-19 pandemic started in China but soon moved to Europe and to the US, and by the end of March the number of cases in advanced economies had surpassed that in East Asia. At the beginning of the pandemic, it was hoped that warm weather and younger populations would shield many developing countries from the virus. However, this hope has not been in realised. Infected cases in Africa, South Asia and Latin America are still growing, with Latin America having surpassed the number of cases in Europe and still growing rapidly. This is not only due to the fact that many developing and emerging countries are populous. If we focus on cases per inhabitants in countries with a population of at least 5 million, we find that about half of the countries in the list are developing or emerging market economies. And these figures are likely to underestimate the problem as the number of reported cases is closely linked to testing capacity which is limited in many developing and emerging market countries.

Notes: Black: advanced economies (the dashed line excludes the US), Gray: East Asia and Pacific; Dark blue: East Europe and Central Asia; Light blue: Latin America and Caribbean, Green: Middle East and North Africa; Purple: South Asia; Red: Sub-Saharan Africa

The economic impact of the pandemic is global. While in October 2019, the IMF estimated that 2020 world GDP growth would be close to 3.4%, the IMF now forecasts that in 2020 world GDP will contract by 6%. The global contraction affects every country covered by the IMF forecasts. The IMF now expects that in 2020 there will only be 16 countries with positive growth in GDP per capita. For the sake of comparison, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, nearly 80 countries registered positive growth in income per capita.

There is a large rapidly growing literature on the economic effect of COVID-19 in advanced economies (for summaries, see Baldwin and Weder di Mauro 2020a, 2020b and Bénassy-Quéré and Weder di Mauro 2020). Research that focuses on developing and emerging market countries is more limited.

In a new VoxEU eBook, we describe the early work focusing on developing and emerging markets (Djankov and Panizza 2020. Developing and emerging market countries differ from advanced economies in both the structure of the economy and the tools that can be used to implement macroeconomic policies aimed at reducing the amplitude and the economic costs of recession associated with the pandemic (see the chapter by Hevia and Neumeyer). The most important amplifying factors include:
• A large share of informal workers or workers employed in micro-firms
• A small share of jobs that can be done from home

The eBook is divided into five sections. The first three sections frame the problem, present regional perspectives, and discuss how the pandemic affects poverty, inequality and informality. The last two sections discuss policy responses and highlight the macro-financial effects of the crisis, including a narrative on the role of the international financial institutions.

The global economic impact of the pandemic is due to the fact that the economic risk of COVID-19 is distinct from its health risk. The chapter by Noy and co-authors compares these two risks and show that, in some instances, the two might be orthogonal. This is especially the case for countries that have a small number of reported cases but are heavily reliant on tourism receipts and have fairly limited fiscal space for battling the ensuing recession.

Djiofack and co-authors focus on Africa and show that COVID-19 is likely to create a lasting impact on labour productivity. They estimate that, in an optimistic scenario, African GDP would be permanently 1% lower than in the pre-COVID scenario.

Arezki and co-authors focus on the Middle East and North Africa. Unsurprisingly, they show that low oil prices will have a negative effect on oil-exporting countries growth. However, they also show that low oil prices will have a negative effect on oil-importing countries in the Middle East and North Africa because these countries will suffer from reduced foreign direct investment, remittances, tourism, and official assistance.

Levy Yeyati and Valdes show that there is substantial heterogeneity within Latin America, with Peru and Chile able to implement a sizeable fiscal reactions, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay with limited fiscal space and Argentina, Brazil and Ecuador with no access to private capital

Developing Asia is an interesting case because, as shown by Abiad and co-authors, it includes countries with very strict containment measures. Within the region, East Asian economies are expected to observe smaller contractions as these countries have been able to contain domestic outbreaks through aggressive testing and contact tracing, and have avoided stringent containment measures. However, tourism-dependent countries in the Pacific sub-region are expected to observe large drops in GDP even if none of these countries has had a significant outbreak. The chapter by Mooney and Zegarra explicitly focuses on tourism and show that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tourism flows to the Caribbean is without precedent in terms of its speed and severity.

The second section of the eBook starts with a chapter by Gómez and co-authors which uses data from the International Coronavirus Survey. The chapter shows that in low- and middle-income countries, individuals report complying less with the containment measures and express higher levels of worries and depression, with women being more worried and depressed than men. Perceptions are important because divergent beliefs about the ‘facts on the ground’ can be a source of social tension which can ultimately lead to conflict during economic crises. Berman and co-authors focus on conflict and, using a counterfactual exercise, find that that the lockdown has reduce conflict intensity in the short run but that the pandemic may amplify inter-religious and inter-ethnic tension and that violence may explode once mobility restrictions are relaxed.

The chapter by Bosio and co-authors studies how long firms in a sample of 34 low- and lower-middle income economies can survive without revenues. They find that the median firm in a low-income country can survive between 6 weeks and 18 weeks and that in middle-income countries the median survival time ranges between 7 weeks and 11 weeks. This disturbing microeconomic picture leads to two predictions: the potential for massive job losses; and a rapidly growing budget deficit for 2002, 2021, and perhaps some years after that. To address the former topic, Cespedes and co-authors develop a model to show that the elimination of jobs in a pandemic is inefficient because of the interaction of two ingredients: (i) while workers may be unproductive during the pandemic, eliminating jobs harms productivity in the recovery; and (ii) employers may be unable to preserve jobs during the pandemic because of frictions that limit the credit needed for paying the wage bill.

The third section of the eBook focuses on how the pandemic will affect informality, inequality, and poverty.

Valensisi evaluates the effect of COVID-19 on global poverty using three different poverty lines ($1.90/day, $3.20/day and $5.50/day) and finds that the pandemic will erode much of the poverty-reduction gains recorded over the last decade. These estimates focus on changes in GDP and assume that the crisis will not affect income distributions. However, the pandemic is likely to increase income inequality as less-skilled people are often unable to work from home and are either more likely to suffer job loss or have to continue working outside home, with a greater probability of being infected. The chapter by Furceri and co-authors uses data from past epidemic to estimate the effect of COVID-19 on inequality and job prospects. Their findings are in line with the hypothesis that the current pandemic could lead to a large increase in inequality which, in turn, will amplify its effect on poverty.

The chapter by Nonvide evaluates the economic policy responses implemented by selected African countries and shows that these measures often exclude informal workers which, in Africa, account for 86% cent of total employment. She suggests that cash transfer programmes and larger social assistance systems need to be a key component of the policy response in Africa. Dhingra also focuses on informal workers and points out that income policies are hard to implement in developing countries. A universal job guarantee programme is an appealing option for getting people back to work once the acute phase of the pandemic is over.

The chapters in section four of the eBook focus on some of the policy responses in the post-COVID recovery phase. These include job protection (Bircan and co-authors), work from home (Gottlieb and co-authors), the protection of export-oriented firms (Woodruff), the streamlining of bankruptcy procedures (Balloch and co-authors), regulatory reforms to increase firm productivity (Djankov and co-authors), and policies for preserving the human capital of the young (Corral and Gatti). The last chapter of this section by Freund and co-authors discusses the disruption of global value chains brought by COVID-19.

2020-06-22|"In addition to stretching outward, the border is also seeping inward. Faced with the challenge of defeating an invisible virus, a growing number of countries are turning to futuristic tracing measures, deploying surveillance tools once used for anti-terrorism and international espionage against their own populations at home. These include measures such as geolocating the cellphones of those who have tested positive for the virus (in some cases, without seeking consent for such tracking); erecting “geo-fences” to draw virtual enclosures around quarantine zones; and activating AI-powered thermal cameras that detect change in a person’s body temperature in order to identify whom in a crowd has a fever (as has been done in Beijing’s Qinghe Railway Station).

Another new possibility is conditioning movement on color-coded QR or numerical scales of individualized “risk assessments” based on big-data-driven algorithms incorporating information on one’s health condition, travel history, and contact tracing. In the United States, Google and Apple will collaborate to use Bluetooth technology to create a new interoperable platform that will permit to “reverse engineer” the movements of the COVID-positive—and those who came in contact with them. Even European countries that adhere to stricter data privacy regulations have warmed to such ideas.

Questions of volitional versus coerced use of such technologies—and their architectures—will have to be debated. The answers may come to serve as a new fault line between democratic and authoritarian regimes. Once put into operation, however, it may prove difficult to return the genie of bio-surveillance back to the bottle, as it provides governments unprecedented technological “see-all” eyes to monitor and track everyone’s mobility everywhere.

Even prior to the current crisis, the European Union funded a pilot project, entitled iBorderCtrl designed to help protect its borders. This monitoring system is designed to prescreen incoming travelers, who are required to “perform a short, automated, non-invasive interview with an avatar [and] undergo a lie detector.” The data is then linked to any pre-existing authority data and stored in large databases that are connected with “portable, wireless connected iBorderCtrl units that can be used inside buses, trains, or any other point [to] verify the identity of each traveler … [and] calculate a cumulative risk factor for each individual.”"|0
2020-06-22|"The past weeks have been a busy time for Hancock Whitney.

Since the U.S. Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) on April 3, the bank has become one of the largest PPP lenders in Louisiana, funding over 12,000 loans totaling $2.4 billion. Most of the businesses receiving these loans are in Hancock Whitney’s five-state Gulf South footprint.

According to S&P Global Market Intelligence analysis, as of May 6, 2020, Hancock Whitney ranks 17th in the United States for the amount of PPP loans processed and processed more loans than any bank headquartered in either Mississippi or Louisiana.

“The majority of the PPP loans for which we received approval are smaller loans that will help smaller businesses vital to the communities we serve,” said John Hairston, CEO of Hancock Whitney. “It’s an honor for us to help sustain our local economies, and we’re very grateful to businesses that chose us to help them get the funds they needed to keep their doors open and people employed during this pandemic.”

In fact, 67 percent of the Hancock Whitney loans were for less than $100,000, and more than 88 percent were for less than $350,000. This ensures that most money went to smaller businesses in the Gulf South.

Hairston said Hancock Whitney bankers worked around the clock to enter completed applications into the SBA queue, while navigating evolving guidelines and the unprecedented demand.

While clients must determine the content of the applications, Hancock Whitney associates were able to assist them in accessing resources needed to complete applications and gather appropriate documentation.

“They were also very pleased to be able to notify clients when they received SBA approval for PPP loans that help further strengthen community resilience and recovery during the uncertainty of the COVID-19 crisis,” Hairston said.

Beyond helping businesses, Hancock Whitney has also strengthened its commitment to its communities with $2.5 million in investments. Those investments include the following:
• $600,000 for supplies to protect residents in the hardest-hit and low-to-moderate income communities, as well as first responders;
• $800,000 for housing relief, including legal services to help disadvantaged individuals fight illegal evictions; and

In addition, bank board members, executives and associates have contributed approximately $400,000 to help Hancock Whitney associates affected by the pandemic.

“This pandemic is creating real, significant challenges for so many people in terms of adequate food, income, basic safeguards against the virus and housing to shelter in place,” Hairston said. “Hancock Whitney has very deep roots in the communities we serve. It’s simply the right thing to do what we can so that together, we help keep people safe and our communities strong.”

The bank has also worked closely with local restaurants in its footprint to provide nearly 10,000 meals to healthcare professionals caring for COVID-19 patients. Besides serving meals and expressing Hancock Whitney’s gratitude to front line workers, the initiative has helped businesses stay open and pay hundreds of employees.

Although many COVID-19 restrictions are being lifted and people are beginning on a journey to a new sense of normalcy, Hairston said Hancock Whitney’s commitment to its clients and communities will remain steadfast in the months and years ahead.

“Together, we can support each other, invest in our communities, reopen our hometowns, rebuild our businesses and create a better future,” he said.

Hancock Whitney has established a special web page, www.hancockwhitney.com/covid19 with updates on bank locations and operations, resources, fraud prevention tips and ongoing direct assistance for individuals and businesses. The page is updated regularly as information evolves.

2020-06-22|"Effective State control over the bulk of Ireland’s private hospitals will come to an end in just over a week’s time. The arrangement was broadly welcomed when first announced in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, but has since proven to be a costly and controversial one.

The Cabinet decided in late May not to take up an option to extend the agreement for a further two months, but said it would look at other ways to make use of private hospital capacity in future.

The agreement represented the State’s largest single investment in its effort to manage coronavirus, with the Cabinet hearing that the total cost over three months could be close to €340 million.

Documents published in recent days by the Department of Public Expenditure confirm that the HSE wanted to retain the 2,000 beds, operating theatres and intensive care and other facilities available under the deal.

Official minutes of the Health Budget Oversight Group – a body comprised of officials from the Department of Health, the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure – maintain that the HSE board wrote to Department of Health seeking to extend the arrangement.

The documents show that from early on there were concerns among senior officials about the extent to which the private hospital facilities were being used as the anticipated surge of Covid-19 cases did not materialise.

They state that on April 16th “all parties expressed concern in relation to the utilisation of private hospital capacity”.

“Maximising the use of facilities available to the HSE is of the utmost importance in the current crisis; it was acknowledged, however, that the Government had agreed to the arrangement on the basis that there would be a significant and urgent requirement for additional capacity.

“In this regard, it was confirmed there was activity taking place in the private hospitals and public patients had moved across.”

The Department of Health had written directly to HSE chief executive Paul Reid a week earlier urging that the private capacity be effectively and fully utilised in the interest of patient care and with immediate effect. It said Minister for Health Simon Harris wanted to have specific arrangements put in place to oversee the volume and type of patients seen in the private hospitals and the costs involved.

The minutes say the group on April 24th noted that there “appears to be excess unused capacity in public and private hospital system at present, attributable to both delays in finalising an agreement with private consultants, and to lower-than-projected levels of activity in acute hospitals”.

The group heard that the clinical opinion “indicated a continuing need to retain this level of capacity”. However, the Department of Public Expenditure argued that “data would be needed to support a case for continuing retention of high levels of capacity beyond the minimum period, e.g. in scenarios where the levels of Covid-19 might be effectively suppressed”.

The group heard on April 30th that occupancy of private hospitals at that stage was estimated to be running at 33 per cent “but there is opportunity in May and June to increase usage subject to public health advice and clinical and operational judgement”.

The group was also told that the occupancy rate at the CityWest hotel complex, which the HSE also took over to increase capacity during the pandemic, was “currently low”. Minutes from the following week note “a growing number of questions regarding the occupancy rate of CityWest Hotel at the time, and potential alternative uses for the facility”.

Two weeks later, on May 21st, the HSE told the group that “on balance” it was “inclined toward the view that some level of supplementary private hospital capacity should be maintained and that the continuation of the current arrangement, for some or all of the private hospitals, until end-August would be appropriate”.

The Department of Public Expenditure pointed to “the need for evaluation of alternatives for securing needed capacity; and that differentials in capacity usage between various types of private hospital would be expected to have a bearing upon considerations of value-for-money and upon the final recommendations”.

The Government has separately instructed the HSE to engage with the private hospitals to secure ongoing access to the facilities in collaboration with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to address essential needs including delays in public patients obtaining treatment. These talks are under way and this week the HSE is expected to meet with doctors’ representatives before the Cabinet considers the issue again."|1
2020-06-22|"Maura Byrne had to watch from her carer’s mobile phone as a funeral service for her husband of almost 70 years took place.

“It knocked the bottom out of my world,” she says of not being able to attend.

Stephen Byrne (93) died of Covid-19 at St James’s Hospital in Dublin on April 19th. Mrs Byrne (94) was recovering from the disease at St Luke’s Hospital in Rathgar at the time.

“I couldn’t see much,” she says of watching the funeral, held at St Agnes’s Church in Crumlin, on the phone. “There was a young nurse, she was lovely, holding my hand, but I felt I should be with my people. I just didn’t understand it.”

Mrs Byrne entered St James’s Hospital with shingles on February 14th and was transferred to St Luke’s for respite two weeks later. She tested positive for Covid-19 on April 11th and returned to St James’s, where she remained until June 8th.

“I was in hospital for a total of 16 weeks,” she says. “I didn’t know what to do with myself. I must have read about 20 books . . . All I wanted to do was come home.”

Mrs Byrne, originally from Ballsbridge, met her husband, a plumber at the Guinness brewery from Arbour Hill, at a Dublin cycling club and they married on September 5th, 1950. They bought the family home on Dowland Road in Walkinstown and had six children – Máire, Stephen, Bernadette, Deirdre, Paul and Dermot. There are now 17 grandchildren and 15 great grandchildren.

Mr Byrne suffered from dementia later in his life and was cared for by his wife until last year, when he moved to the Croft nursing home in Inchicore. He was brought into St James’s Hospital on April 16th after being diagnosed with Covid-19 and died there three days later.

“I’d ring every night and one of the girls would say he’s fine, as always. Then Máire rang me and said ‘Dad’s not well and he’s in James’s’,” Mrs Bryne recalls.

“I said ‘I’ll go over and see him’. She [Máire] said ‘Mam you can’t, you’re in lockdown you can’t go over to see him.’ So Deirdre and Bernadette were allowed to go in . . . He died the next morning.

“I couldn’t believe it, that I wouldn’t be allowed go [to the funeral]. I maintain I’ve had no closure. A funeral is a closure.

“Yesterday evening Máire and I were looking at photographs and there was a photograph of the coffin in the church and a photograph of the coffin in the crematorium and I felt good after it. I sort of felt weepy but that’s all the finish I’m ever going to get.”

Mrs Byrne says not being able to go to the funeral was very difficult as all she wanted to do was “hold his hand”. The Byrnes plan to arrange a Mass later in the year to remember Stephen that can be attended by all his family and friends.

“He was the kindest and most loving man,” she says. “You always had that feeling that you could depend on him. He never ever let you down . . . Deirdre’s girls were asking me one day ‘how did you know he was the right person?’ I said ‘you just know’.”

As his dementia progressed, Mr Bryne would fail to remember or recognise relatives but Mrs Byrne says “now and again he would say ‘I like you, you’re a nice lady’”.

Since being released from hospital, Mrs Byrne has been cared for at home by Máire and is feeling better with each passing day.

“My health is wonderful. I’m doing a little bit more every day. I can now dress myself. I can put on my shoes, which I couldn’t do,” she says.

“At night I say ‘good night Stephen’ and I say a Hail Mary, because that’s the only prayer he knew,.I say ‘Good night, Stephen’ and then I go to sleep.”"|0
2020-06-22|"Unmasked! The effect of face masks on the spread of COVID-19

Confronted with a novel, aggressive coronavirus, Germany implemented measures to reduce its spread since March 2020. Requiring people to wear face masks in public places has, however, been a subject of controversy and isolating the effect of mask-wearing on the spread of COVID-19 is not simple. This column looks at the town of Jena and other German regions that introduced face masks before the rest of the country to see whether the requirement makes a difference in the number of new COVID-19 cases. Requiring face masks to be worn decreases the growth rate of COVID-19 cases by about 40% in Germany.

On a global scale, the extent of COVID-related lockdowns is massive, and their socio-economic impact is expected to be far-reaching (Barba Navaretti et al. 2020, McKibbin and Fernando 2020). When it comes to the estimated effects of containment measures, timing seems to matter (Deb et al. 2020).

In Germany, significant actions to reduce the spread of the virus have been taken from mid-March onwards (Hartl et al. 2020). However, the obligation to wear face masks in public has been the subject of controversy and was introduced only relatively late throughout Germany (around 27 April 2020).

At present, virologists are collecting more and more clinical evidence that face masks catch infectious particles produced from speaking, coughing, or sneezing, which may reduce the risk of infecting another person (Prather et al. 2020). Proper wearing of a face mask could thus help to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect risk groups from infections in a cheap and simple way.

Finding out whether face masks indeed reduce the spread of COVID-19 is thus important. Against the available evidence from clinical studies or previous pandemics, we ask: Can we identify a significant effect of face masks on the spread of COVID-19 by looking at the development of registered COVID-19 cases? Yes, we can. We zoom in on the case of Jena, a town of 110,000 inhabitants in the federal state of Thuringia, Germany.

Jena presents a unique case in Germany (see also Mitze et al. 2020), as the obligation to wear face masks in public transport, shops, and workplaces was introduced much earlier there (on 6 April) than in all other regions in Germany (around 27 April). The introduction of obligatory face masks was accompanied by a public campaign “Jena zeigt Maske” (“Jena shows mask”), which started one week earlier to make the local population aware of this novel measure.

We can observe differences in the timing of introducing face masks across German regions due to the institutional setup of the German federal system: according to the German Infection Protection Act, federal states are in charge of formulating and prescribing public health measures to fight the spread of infections. Local municipalities and health authorities then decide on the implementation of specific measures, e.g. the timing of their introduction. And Jena was the first to act.

If we look at the number of COVID-19 cases in Jena, masks seem to have a positive effect. The number of registered new infections fell to almost zero in the days after masks were introduced. But was this really due to the introduction of masks and a publicly visible campaign? Unfortunately, there is no second Jena in Germany, which would allow us to measure the spread of COVID-19 if face masks had not been introduced under otherwise identical conditions.

Our solution is to apply the synthetic control method (Abadie and Gardeazabal 2003, Abadie et al. 2010, Abadie 2020) to construct a counterfactual that closely follows the COVID-19 trend in Jena before masks were introduced. The idea is to construct a weighted average of similar regions in Germany (with no mask obligations) at the time when mask-wearing became compulsory in Jena.

Regions and their respective sample weights are chosen based on the cumulative number and changes in newly registered COVID-19 cases before 6 April, together with structural regional characteristics such as regional population density, average age of the population, proportion of senior citizens, and average number of doctors and pharmacies per inhabitants. In the baseline, both West and East German cities such as Rostock, Darmstadt, and Trier constitute this synthetic Jena (see Mitze et al. 2020 for the full list).

We then use this counterfactual to estimate the hypothetical change in cases in Jena after 6 April. This tells us approximately what would have happened if no masks had been introduced in the city.

Table 1 shows a significant difference in the number of cases in Jena and the comparison group without masks after 6 April. Twenty days after the introduction of mandatory masks in Jena, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases increased from ‘only’ 142 to 158. In the synthetic Jena, the number rose from 143 to 205. This corresponds to a reduction in the number of cases by around 23%.

Notes: The sample of all municipal districts in Germany covers 401 regions; the subsample of cities covers 105 larger cities (kreisfreie Städte). For details, see Mitze et al. (2020).

We find that the difference is most striking for the over-60 age group. For this group, the increase in cumulative cases in Jena decreased by more than 50% compared to its synthetic control group (see Mitze et al. 2020 for details).

Panel A in Figure 1 shows that the effect gradually appears over time. However, its gradual emergence after about 3-4 days is too fast from an epidemiological point of view. With COVID-19’S average incubation period of approximately 5 days and a potential reporting delay of 2 or 3 days for laboratory results (Donsimoni et al. 2020), effects on reported new cases should only be seen after 7 or 8 days. An announcement effect may have played a role in Jena.

In panel B, we therefore start our analysis on 30 March, the day the mask campaign was announced. In this case, we observe a widening gap between Jena and the comparison group after about 10 days. Taken together, this effect appears to be plausible and is found to be robust when confronted with different sensitivity tests (see Mitze et al. 2020 for details).

Figure 1 Treatment effects of face masks in Jena over time

Still, can we draw conclusions for other regions or even other countries from a single case when we cannot completely rule out that Jena is special because of unobserved factors? We therefore go beyond a single case study and examine all those regions that had introduced masks before or by 22 April. Besides Jena, these include regions that required masks before the state-wide requirement was introduced (Nordhausen in Thuringia, Rottweil in Baden-Württemberg, the Main-Kinzig district in Hesse, and Wolfsburg in Lower Saxony), as well as all regions in Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt. We compare these regions with the majority of German regions that only introduced masks on 27 April or later. The main advantage is that we can calculate an average effect over different regions, although this comes at the expense of differences in the timing of introduction, which are smaller.

We find smaller effects than in the Jena case study (Table 1). However, the average reduction in case numbers compared to their synthetic counterparts remains significant and sizable. Depending on the chosen sample, 10 days after the introduction of masks, the decrease in the cumulative cases is between 2.3 and 4.2%. Generally, the effect is larger for the subsample of larger cities (kreisfreie Städte).

Based on our findings, we calculate a rule-of-thumb measure for the relative decrease in the daily growth rate of COVID-19 cases of about 40% (Table 1). Consider a region in which the number of COVID-19 cases increased by 10% from one day to another. This increase would have been only 6% if there had been an obligation to wear face masks. With a 10% daily increase in COVID-19, cases double within 7 days; in contrast, a 6% daily increase means cases double only within 12 days.

In summary, the introduction of mandatory face masks has slowed down the spread of COVID-19 in Germany. This result agrees with the findings of epidemiologists and virologists who explain that face coverings limit airflow when speaking, thereby reducing the transmission of infectious particles.

The observed effect in Jena is larger than the average effect for other regions with face-mask requirements. Two mechanisms may explain this difference: first, with Jena being a pioneer city in Germany when it comes to the introduction of face masks, the local population may have taken the crisis more seriously than in other regions, causing a sort of Hawthorne effect. In other words, the population may have taken the introduction of masks as a strong signal to follow contact restrictions closely. Another likely reason is that anticipation effects have increased over time in Germany: people in other regions may have chosen to wear masks even before wearing them became mandatory.

In sum, our results suggest that requiring masks is a cost-effective, less economically harmful, and democracy-compatible containment measure for COVID-19.

2020-06-23|"One day after Wanheng Menayothin announced his retirement, promoter Piyarat Vachirarattanawong insisted on Monday the undefeated world champion has yet to hang up his gloves.

The WBC minimumweight champion, known in Thailand as Wanheng CPF, announced on his Facebook page on Sunday that he was retiring for health reasons.

He said he had thought thoroughly before making the decision.

""Nobody knows my body better than myself,"" he wrote. ""Everybody wants money but I prefer protecting my body. So I am quitting boxing.""

In his previous bout, the 34-year-old boxer, whose real name is Chayaphon Moonsri, scored a unanimous decision over South Africa's Simphiwe Khonco in Chon Buri last October.

Piyarat said he had a talk with him on Monday.

""I talked to him on the phone and he admitted he did it because of stress during the Covid-19 pandemic,"" he said.

Wanheng was scheduled to defend his title against the Philippines' Marco Rementizo in California last month.

But the match, which would be Wanheng's first outside his country, was postponed indefinitely because of the coronavirus outbreak.

His handlers have signed a five-bout contract with US-based Golden Boy Promotions for Wanheng to fight in America.

Piyarat said he wanted to arrange a warm-up fight for Wanheng but he could not bring in a foreign boxer due to travel restrictions.

Also, fighting against a fellow Thai would be improper, he said.

Piyarat said he planned for Wanheng to return to the ring in September.

Wanheng admitted he made the announcement without consulting anyone.

He said he would have a check-up and let the doctor decide if he could continue fighting.

Menayothin boxing gym chief Chaisit Kongkiatkong said the champion had complained he had a breathing problem during training.

""I can't prevent him from quitting. Everything is up to him,"" said Chaisit, who is also his personal manager.

Wanheng took the crown from Mexico's Oswaldo Novoa with a ninth-round stoppage in November 2014.

Since then, he has won 18 consecutive bouts, including 12 title defences.

Wanheng is the longest-reigning active world champion with an unblemished record of 54 wins, with 18 knockouts.

He is currently one of Thailand's only two world champions with the other being WBA minimumweight title-holder Knockout CPF."|1
2020-06-23|"Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference is completely online this year, but that doesn’t mean the company held back on its announcements. Since there was no live audience to interrupt the keynote with applause, hoots, and hollers, Apple covered a ton of ground at a brisk pace during its two-hour presentation on Monday. You can watch the keynote in its entirety online, but if you don’t have the time, you can find out what happened in our summary right here.

It’s been rumored for a while, but Apple’s announcement that it will switch from Intel processors to its own silicon was the final segment of the keynote, saving the biggest news for last. Apple CEO Tim Cook said that Apple has planned for a two-year transition, with the first ARM-based Mac coming later this year.

Apple has a kit available for third-party software developers to create software that can natively run on ARM-based Macs. The company also revealed Rosetta2, technology that will allow users to run software originally created for Intel-based Macs.

We have the complete details on Apple’s transition to its own ARM processors.

Usually, the Mac is a short section of the WWDC keynote. This year, it’s front and center, thanks mostly to the ARM switch. But there are also big changes coming to macOS this year. The next version of macOS is called Big Sur, and it’s officially version 11.

If you felt like macOS was started to look a little tired, you’re in for a treat with Big Sur. It features a revamped user interface, with reworked menus, app sidebars, and app icons. Notification Center has improved functionality, and Control Center—a main UI element for iPhones and iPads—is now available on the Mac.

Apple used its Mac Catalyst technology to convert the iOS versions of Maps and Message to new Mac versions. And Safari has a slew of new features, including improved speed, start page customizations, improved support for Extensions, and new privacy features.

Learn more about the new features of macOS Big Sur.

This is the iOS update that longtime iPhone uses have been aching for, mostly because it has a feature that’s long overdue: A new Home screen. Apps can be automatically grouped together in a screen called the App Library. You can add widgets to your Home screen for quick access to the information you need.

Siri gets some updates, with a new interface and new incorporation in a Translate app that can translate written and spoken words in real time. Translate works completely on the device to maintain your privacy.

Apple has brought the iPad’s picture-in-picture feature over to iOS. If you’re watching a video or making a FaceTime call, the video screen will be in a persistent box, regardless of the app you are using.

Get the details on iOS 14’s new features.

Last year, Apple introduced iPadOS, a version of iOS that’s designed for use on Apple’s tablet. With version 14, iPadOS continues to evolve with features specific to the iPad.

Apple is changing the design language of the iPadOS so that app can take better advantage of the platform. Apps will stop looking like iOS versions that were brought over to the iPad. You’ll see better implementations of sidebars, toolbars, and menus.

iPadOS 14 has improved Apple Pencil support, specifically for handwritten text. Apple is bringing over its Scribble handwriting recognition engine, so you can write in apps as well as input fields, and the iPad will be able to recognize it.

Many of the new features in iOS 14 are coming to iPadOS, such as the revamped Siri interface, App Clips, and redesigned widgets. However, iPadOS is not getting the App Library feature.

The next version of the Apple Watch operating system has some major new features. The main new feature is sleep tracking. It can track how much sleep you get, and also has a “wind down” function.

In this time of the COVID-19 pandemic, Apple has created a new feature to help you wash your hands. It can sense when you’re doing so, and start a 20-scoend time to make sure you wash properly.

Other new watchOS 7 features include the ability to share watch faces with others, a new Dance workout, and an enhanced Noise app to help protect your hearing.

Here are the 5 ways watchOS 7 will supercharge your Apple Watch this fall.

The smart home is an ever-growing market for Apple, and the company made several improvements to the Home app and the underlying HokmeKit technology. Among the features introduced were:
• The ability to create tracking zones for security cameras

NZD/USD bounces back ahead of last week’s low (0.6381) as the RBNZ is expected to keep the official cash rate (OCR) at the record low of 0.25%, and the central bank may tame speculation for additional monetary support after expanding the Large Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) programin May to NZ$60 billion from NZ$33 billion.

The RBNZ may soften the dovish forward guidance for monetary as the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) largely anticipates the economic slowdown from COVID-19 to be “followed by a strong rebound,” and hopes for a V-shape recovery may encourage the central bank to retain the current policy in the second half of 2020 as Governor Adrian Orr and Co. “expect to see retail interest rates decline further as lower wholesale borrowing costs are passed through to retail customers.”

In turn, it remains to be seen if the RBNZ will prepare New Zealand households and businesses for a negative interest rate policy (NIRP) as Chief Economist Yuong Ha reveals that “we’ve given the banking system until the end of the year to get ready so that the option is there for the Monetary Policy Committee in a year’s time,” and the central bank may largely rely on its balance sheet to support the economy as the NZIER’s Shadow Board reveals that “opponents of a negative OCR consider QE (quantitative easing), as a support to stimulatory fiscal policy, to be a more effective way to support economic activity.”

A material adjust in the RBNZ’s forward guidance may spark a bullish reaction in the New Zealand Dollar if the central bank tames speculation for additional monetary support, but more of the same from Governor Orr and Co. may undermine the recent rebound in NZD/USD as the“Committee agreed that it will stand ready to deploy further tools as needed, should the need for stimulus continue to increase.”

With that said, bets for a NIRP in New Zealand may drag on NZD/USD as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell tames bets for negative US interest rates, and recent price action warns of a potential shift in market behavior as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) falls back from overbought territory and threatens the bullish formation from March.

• None Keep in mind, NZD/USD has failed to retain the range from the second half of 2019 as the decline from earlier this year produced a break of the October low (0.6204), with a ‘death cross’ taking shape in March as the 50-Day SMA (0.6197) crossed below the 200-Day SMA (0.6319).

2020-06-23|"Strategies for passive and active immunization to combat and prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection should take into account the pathogenesis of COVID-19, which can lead to death. The inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 is thought to drive or at least exacerbate the disease process, particularly during the second week after infection becomes symptomatic. How may these immune responses that modulate pathogenesis be affected by NAbs?

The lethal coronaviruses cause fatal acute lung injury (ALI) by driving hypercytokinemia and aggressive inflammation through incompletely understood mechanisms. In macaque models of SARS-CoV-1 infection and passive or active immunization, IgG specific for the S-protein was reported to exacerbate ALI by counteracting inflammation-resolving responses, abrogating wound-healing, promoting monocyte chemoattractant peptide-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) production, and increasing proinflammatory monocyte and macrophage recruitment (Liu et al., 2019). Likewise, in human patients who died of SARS-CoV-1 infection, pulmonary proinflammatory macrophages accumulated in the lungs, whereas wound-healing macrophages were absent (Liu et al., 2019). Moreover, two observations noted above raise questions about the causal relationship between antibodies and severity of infection: NAb responses were faster in the patients who later died than in those who recovered (Zhang et al., 2006; Ho et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2019), and older patients who had recovered from mild COVID-19, had significantly stronger NAb and S-protein-binding antibody responses than younger ones, whereas higher age is a major risk factor for lethal COVID-19 (Wu et al., 2020).

In vitro, sera from subsequently deceased patients enhanced SARS-CoV-1 induced MCP-1 and IL-8 production by human monocyte–derived wound-healing macrophages, whereas blockade of the FcγR receptor reduced these effects (Liu et al., 2019). One must be prudent when extrapolating from a macaque model of SARS-CoV-1 infection to human COVID-19 patients, but the antibody response to these lethal coronaviruses might play a role in disease progression, perhaps by formation of immune complexes, and by promoting macrophage infiltration and sustained inflammation. We hypothesize that there may be a causal link between seroconversion and the rapid deterioration that can take place in the second week after the first symptoms, but this remains to be established.

Other reports suggest that anti-S and other CoV-specific antibodies have pathogenic effects in animal models. Thus, multiple CoV vaccines were associated with an increase in eosinophilic proinflammatory pulmonary responses upon challenge of the immunized animals (Bolles et al., 2011; Honda-Okubo et al., 2015; Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2014). Previous SARS-CoV-1 infection limited virus replication in African green monkeys but not lung inflammation, when the animals were re-challenged with the same virus (Clay et al., 2012). It has not been determined which factors, such as viral dose and the extent of the innate and adaptive immune responses, yield these problematic effects. A particularly important knowledge gap is whether certain specificities and other properties of antibodies are responsible.

Pre-existing serum antibodies against influenza antigens were consistently associated with severe illness in patients during the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic (To et al., 2012; Monsalvo et al., 2011). Of note is that those antibodies did not neutralize influenza virus (To et al., 2012) and that immune complex formation was implicated as a pathogenic trigger (Monsalvo et al., 2011). Whether these observations are linked to the findings reported by Liu et al. remains to be seen (Liu et al., 2019)."|2

In a bid to speed up the roll-out of ultra-fast broadband across Italy, the Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Monday that the state might consider raising its stake in TIM, the former phone monopoly. The Italian government believes that building an ultra-fast broadband network will be key to reviving and boosting the economy after the damaging impact of COVID-19.

The government has called on TIM and its rival Open Fiber to reach a rapid agreement to create a single network in a bid to avoid duplicating investments which could prove costly. Open Fiber, who operates a wholesale-only network, is jointly owned by Enel and state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP). CDP is also TIM’s second largest shareholder, owning a 10% stake, with France’s Vivendi owning 25%.

Despite ongoing talks, TIM and Open Fiber have just to reach an agreement over merging their network assets due to differences over governance and regulation, among other issues.

According to Reuters, the founder of the senior coalition party 5-Star Movement, Beppe Grillo published a blogpost calling on CDP to increase its stake in TIM to approximately 25% thereby equalling Vivendi’s holding.

2020-06-23|"Monetary policy and US housing expansions: What we can expect for the post-COVID-19 housing recovery

The COVID-19 shock has ended the eight-year long US housing market expansion. At the same time, the Federal Reserve and the US Government have deployed significant resources to help weather the ongoing crisis. But the trajectory of the post-COVID-19 recovery remains uncertain. Using a time-varying parameter model, this column suggests that the next US housing recovery may exhibit similar features to the 2012-19 expansion: a sluggish response of housebuilding to rising demand, but a strong response of house prices.

The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted an immediate response from economists and policymakers in an attempt to design appropriate policies to tackle the ongoing health and economic crisis (Baldwin and Weder di Mauro 2020a, 2020b). While it is highly uncertain how the post-COVID-19 recovery will evolve, in this column we look at past US housing expansions to help us shed light on the possible trajectory of the next housing recovery.

Housing is a very different asset from any other financial asset, such as equities or bonds. The homeowner owns not only the dwelling itself but also the land on which it sits on. Housing can also be seen as a consumption good, in the sense that the owner consumes the housing services of living there. Moreover, housing is of particular interest for economists and policymakers alike.
• First, housing is the main asset for the majority of households – over 65% of US households own a home, while only around 24% own directly stocks and bonds, according to the Survey of Consumer Finances. In addition, the distribution of housing assets is less skewed towards the richest, which contrasts with financial assets – households in the bottom 80% of the income distribution hold roughly 43% of total real estate wealth in the economy, but only 11% of total stocks and bonds.1
• Second, real estate accounts for a substantial fraction of economic activity, with private residential investment accounting for 4% of GDP, and housing consumption accounting for 20% of total private consumption expenditures.2
• Third, recent research has found that the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of housing wealth is much larger than that out of financial wealth (Carroll et al. 2011).

The prominent role of housing in the economy has generated a lot of interest in how shocks to demand affect house prices and the real economy more generally. For instance, an expansion in monetary policy can stimulate housing demand via lower borrowing costs – households typically finance housing with mortgage debt (DeFusco and Paciorek 2017). Apart from this credit channel, monetary policy can also influence housing demand through the collateral or refinancing channel, whereby easier monetary conditions and higher house prices lead to higher home equity. This additional equity allows households to increase borrowing to finance consumption (Aladangady 2017, Beraja et al. 2019, Bhutta and Keys 2016, Iacoviello 2005).

Housebuilding in the recent recovery had been remarkably different from past episodes

House prices in the US had been increasing at a strong pace in the years before the pandemic shock struck. But despite the strong expansion in house prices, housebuilding activity had been relatively weak compared to the strong housing boom over 1996-2006 (Aastveit et al. 2020).

To place the dynamics of the housing market and economic activity into historical perspective, we compare real house prices, building permits, and real GDP across the past four housing expansions. We use the Harding-Pagan (2002) algorithm to identify turning points in real house price cycles since the mid-1970s. We identify four housing expansions: 1975 M9–1979 M7, 1982 M11–1989 M3, 1996 M12–2006 M4, and 2012 M3–2019 M12. These cycles are broadly in line with the housing literature (Glaeser et al. 2008). We scale real GDP and house prices to be 100 at the beginning of each housing expansion, so that we can easily compare the dynamics across indicators. We show building permits as a percentage of the housing stock at the beginning of each cycle. To smooth out strong fluctuations in the monthly data, we show quarterly data in Figure 1.

The pace of house price appreciation displays a broadly similar pattern across housing expansions, with the exception of the 1982-89 period (Figure 1). The recent recovery that started in early-2012, and that may have possibly ended in early-2020, is particularly similar to the one in the run-up to the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). By contrast, housebuilding activity, as illustrated by the number of building permits approved for construction, stands out in the 2012-19 expansion: the flow of permits averaged 0.9% of the initial housing stock in 2012, which compares with an average of around 1.6%-2.0% during the previous expansions. Aastveit et al. (2020) have found that the sluggish pace of housebuilding is linked to a decline in supply elasticities, which in turn is likely related to the tightening in land-use regulation over the past decades (Herkenhoff et al. 2018, Hsieh and Moretti, 2019). Declining supply elasticities imply that an increase in housing demand may be absorbed more by house prices. Finally, while the GDP dynamics have been relatively similar across the first three housing expansions, the economic performance during the most recent recovery has been subdued. In the light of these changes in the housing market, we ask whether the transmission of housing demand to the housing market has changed over time. We use monetary policy shocks as a proxy for shifts in housing demand to investigate this question.

Notes: Real GDP and real house prices are scaled to be 100 at the beginning of each housing expansion. Building permits refers to its flow as % of the housing stock at the beginning of each expansion. The horizontal axis shows quarters around the beginning of each expansion, and the vertical line at zero is the starting point.

We apply a flexible time-varying parameter (TVP) vector autoregressive (VAR) model that is largely data-driven in modelling changes in the dynamic relationship between variables (Cogley and Sargent 2001, Primiceri 2005). We estimate the TVP-VAR model over 1991 M1–2019 M6 using seven variables: (1) monthly GDP from Macroeconomic Advisers, (2) the CPI, (3) the policy rate measured by the Wu and Xia (2016) shadow rate to account for the zero lower bound, (4) building permits, (5) house prices, (6) the Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012) spread, and (7) bank credit. A model with these variables produces dynamic responses that are supported by standard macroeconomic theory. We use state-of-the-art high-frequency monetary policy shocks obtained from market surprises on intra-daily data on Fed future contracts following monetary policy announcements (Paul 2020).

A monetary policy shock that decreases the policy rate stimulates housing demand and therefore raises output, building permits, and house prices (Figure 2). But while the response of GDP seems to be overall constant over time, the responses of house prices and permits exhibit substantial time variation. In particular, house prices have become more responsive since the GFC, reaching levels similar to those during the pre-crisis period. In contrast, although the response of permits has recovered after the GFC, it remains well-below historical averages.

Figure 2 Responses to an expansionary monetary policy shock over time

Notes: The figure shows the cumulative median time-varying responses of real house prices, building permits, and real GDP to an expansionary monetary policy shock that decreases the policy rate by 25 bp.

We investigate this time variation further by looking at the relative responses between permits and house prices for one and three years after a monetary policy shock. These relative responses allow us to gain insights into the dynamic relationship between permits and house prices; the percentage change in permits for each percentage point change in house prices. The relationship between permits and house prices seems rather stable since the early-1990s and until the GFC. After the GFC, we find evidence of a substantial decline in the relative response of permits for a given percentage change in house prices: a drop of around 15% in the relative response after one year, and of around 20% in the relative response after three years (upper panel of Figure 3). This finding is consistent with the notion that construction has been reacting less to changes in demand, i.e. that US housing supply elasticities have declined (Aastveit et al. 2020).

We also look at the relative percentage increase in GDP for each percentage increase in house prices, akin to the concept of a sacrifice ratio (Ball 1994). We find that the transmission of monetary policy to real activity relative to house prices has weakened since around 2013. Our estimates show that an expansionary monetary policy shock in 2019 M6 raised house prices relatively more than output. The experience around the GFC stands in stark contrast. This was a period when the measures adopted by the Federal Reserve to fight the crisis seemed to have supported economic activity more relative to house prices (bottom panel of Figure 3). One possible interpretation of our results is that a shock to housing demand that is increasingly absorbed by house prices, rather than supply, may contribute less to overall economic output. This point relates to recent research arguing that the low interest rate environment in the aftermath of the GFC may have rendered monetary policy less effective for economic activity (Berger et al. 2020, Eichenbaum et al. 2018).

2020-06-23|"EU firms in the post-COVID-19 environment: Investment-debt trade-offs and the optimal sequencing of policy responses

COVID-19 and the related lockdowns have taken their toll on the EU corporate sector. This column uses an accounting approach and ORBIS firm-level data to assess the medium-term strategic choices for firms. Assuming three months of lockdown and under different normalisation scenarios, cumulative net revenue losses of EU companies are estimated in the range of 13-24% of EU GDP. These losses create a difficult trade-off for firms between protecting investments and increasing their leverage. To properly accompany the recovery, policies to ease access to credit should be matched to enhanced instruments for long-term, equity-type financing.

Covid-19 and the related lockdown have taken their toll on the EU corporate sector. A sudden drop in revenues and only partly adjustable costs have led to a fast depletion of firms’ cash buffers, even in the context of strong policy intervention.Several studies have shown a large share of firms facing liquidity shortfalls during 2020 (Banerjee et al. 2020, OECD 2020, Demmou et al. 2020, and EC 2020). In a first exercise (EIB 2020a), using an accounting approach, we estimate that even after strong policy intervention, 51%-58% of EU firms face liquidity shortfalls after three months of lockdown (Table 1).

Table 1 Liquidity shortfall of non-financial corporations under various scenarios and across time (EU)

Note: Based on EU27. The columns ""Share"" indicates the proportion of corporates that do not have enough cash to withstand their payment obligations over the period, as percent of the population (1st column) and of value added (2nd column).

With expectation of a U-shaped recovery, we extend this exercise to assess the possible medium-term strategic choices for firms. We use a comprehensive dataset of more than 1.3 million non-financial corporates located in the EU, accounting for around €3 trillion of assets in the final sample. We present four alternative scenarios, to account for (1) strength of the immediate policy support and (2) length of the normalisation period. The impact of the crisis is illustrated by adjusting each component of net revenues symmetrically for all firms. Under each scenario, we account for the change in corporate activity using the calibrations presented in Table 2.

We compute the cumulative net revenue loss for each individual firm. The median reduction in net revenues could range between 5% and 10% of total assets across the four scenarios (Figure 1). SMEs will suffer a reduction between 6% and 11% of assets. Larger corporates would be significantly less impacted, from 2% to 4% of assets. Weighting the estimates by size reduces the overall decline in net revenues to 4% to 8% of total assets, a loss between €1.9 trillion and €3.4 trillion, or from 13% to 24% of EU GDP.

Figure 1 Net revenues reduction associated to various scenarios (median, % of total assets)

Figure 2 Filling the gap: Impact on investment and indebtedness (% of GDP, EU economy)

Notes: Results under the benign scenario (heightened policy support and 3 months normalisation period)

We focus on the most benign scenario (heightened policy support and three months normalisation) and consider a simplified accounting identity to illustrate the impact of lower revenues on the main balance sheet components. The simplified identity assumes that all earnings are retained. Net revenues finance the accumulation of cash and liquid assets, real investment, and debt reduction. Hence, in this framework, lower net revenues can result in reduced cash balance, increased indebtedness, and lower investment.

Cash buffers can absorb a small part of the reduction in net revenues, especially as EU corporates entered the crisis with sizeable cash positions. During the lockdown period, these positions have decreased, but after the crisis it is unlikely that most firms will fully restore their cash positions. We estimate that during the Lehman and sovereign debt crises, cash positions were reduced by 2% of GDP. According to current forecasts, during the Covid-19 crisis, output will be reduced by up to twice as much than during the financial crises. Moreover, given the current very low interest rate environment, the return on cash and liquid assets is almost nil. Hence, we assume that following the Covid-19 crisis, cash positions will absorb 3% of GDP of the loss in net revenues.

EU corporate investment shrinks by 31% to 52% while corporate indebtedness rises by 4% to 6% of GDP (Figure 2). According to the EIB Investment Survey, two-thirds of EU corporate investment is financed internally. Hence, after drawing on cash positions, around two-thirds of the losses in net revenues (which, after drawing on cash positions represent 10% of GDP) would be absorbed by lower investment, a reduction of 7% of GDP, equivalent to a decline of 52% in corporate investment. Debt would also contribute to fill up the gap, rising by around 4% of GDP. Alternatively, corporations could increase their access to external finance. Assuming that the whole sample of firms tap external finance (even those that do not do so in normal times), the share of external financing would rise from one-third to 60% of total financing. Investment would then be reduced by 4% of GDP (a fall of 31% compared to the level in 2019) but indebtedness would increase by 6% of GDP. The fall in corporate investment would be around twice that recorded during the financial crisis, when corporate investment fell by 19%. This is in line with forecasts that project a much higher impact on GDP, and with the EC findings of a cumulative drop in private investment of €831 billion in 2020 and 2021 taken together (see EC 2020).

Policymakers have acted swiftly, pledging support and stepping up measures to support corporates as developments have unfolded. Wage subsidies, tax deferrals, and loan payment moratoria have been alleviating the cash flow problems of firms. All member states have implemented some form of tax forbearance or some form of wage subsidy. However, these programmes are limited in time, scope, and scale.

Central banks, supervisory authorities, and governments have deployed specific measures to maintain the credit channel. Announcements on targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO) and easing on collateral requirements have secured banks’ access to long-term credit through the crisis. Supervision authorities have provided early indications to banks to use capital and liquidity buffers through the crisis, as well as guidance on provisioning through the cycle. This has been complemented by the widespread use of national credit guarantee schemes, and at the EU-level, the set-up of exceptional financing facilities, such as the Pan-European Guarantee Fund.

While preserving access to credit is key in the short term, absorbing more debt poses problems for a sizeable part of the corporate sector in the medium term, due to leverage constraints. A considerable number of European firms are likely to reach excessive levels of financial leverage as the COVID-19 crisis unfolds. As a consequence, a large share of EU firms could start the recovery period with deleveraging pressures. This in turn would have negative consequences on these companies’ ability to carry out investment plans.

Publicly funded equity-type instruments complement loans and guarantees to alleviate the excess leverage problem. The increase in corporate leverage due to the COVID-19 crisis can be limited by the use of equity-type instruments which absorb any losses but also share in any future profits. However, it is not easy to find effective equity instruments, especially for SMEs whose owners are often reluctant to allow external ownership (for a creative proposal see Boot et al. 2020). Equity-type instruments are an integral part of the EU recovery plan. The EIB has long experience as an anchor to both the EU venture capital and venture debt markets. Moreover, equity-type instruments are envisaged in the Next Generation EU package through the new Solvency Support Instrument (SSI).

Public support to the corporate sector inevitably raises the question of moral hazard and might include a push towards some long-term policy goals. Measures need to be designed carefully. Support measures that restrict direct benefits for existing creditors, e.g. including limiting dividend payments, can contribute to mitigate moral hazard issues. Temporary measures and built-in sunset clauses can help to avoid permanent distortions. In addition, increasingly targeting support and devising measures with ‘smart conditionality’ – linking support to steps that improve firms’ longer-term resilience, such as the adoption of new business processes or digitalisation – can be a way to preserve activity and also strengthen firms’ perspectives going forward.

The emergence of a trade-off between leverage and investment suggest some optimal sequencing in terms of policy response. While at the inception of the crisis, deferrals and grace periods play a role in preventing firms’ liquidity shortfalls, those measures are temporary by nature. Measures to support access to credit, including guarantee schemes, follow, but create risk of over-leveraging. To properly accompany the recovery, policies to ease access to credit should be matched with enhanced instruments for long-term equity-type financing. As public support to the private sector always raises the question of moral hazard, transparency and incentive compatibility will be crucial to prevent it. Going beyond the immediate liquidity needs of the corporate sector, long-term, equity-type instruments should be considered to avoid excessive corporate leverage and to preserve financial stability.

2020-06-23|"Preserving capital in the financial sector to weather the storm

On 27 May, the ESRB General Board adopted a wide-ranging recommendation to suspend pay-outs across different segments of the European financial system until the end of 2020. This column discusses why arguments for such restrictions weigh stronger than ownership and management rights during these unprecedented times. It provides a rationale for why the recommendation is a wide-ranging one, including banks, investment firms, insurance companies and CCPs and referring to all voluntary pay-outs, including dividends, share buy-backs and variable remuneration to material risk-takers.

Unlike the Global Financial Crisis, the current crisis did not start in the financial sector. As most sectors in the economy, however, the financial sector will be negatively affected by the crisis, through loan and income losses (Mann 2020, Perotti 2020). At the same time, the financial sector is central in efforts to mitigate the crisis and speed up the recovery (Beck 2020). Specifically, banks can play a key role in maintaining liquidity support for firms during the lockdown phase, as has become obvious from the drawdown of credit lines over the past months (Acharya and Steffen 2020). Banks play an important role as a conduit for fiscal support measures for firms and households and serve as a critical transmission channel for monetary policy. Central counterparties (CCPs) support hedging activities by financial market participants, more important than ever in these highly uncertain times.

Given this important role and the risks to which the financial sector is exposed, governments and regulators across the globe have taken decisive actions early on, including providing capital relief, liquidity support and loan guarantees (Baldwin and Weder di Maruro 2020).1 These actions seek to limit losses and encourage the financial sector to keep supporting the real economy. The goal of maintaining sufficient levels of capital and loss-absorbing capacity is also the reason why regulators across Europe have encouraged banks and insurance corporations to refrain from voluntary pay-outs (e.g. dividends, bonuses and share buybacks aimed at remunerating shareholders).

On 27 May, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) decided to reinforce and complement these recommendations with a broader recommendation.2 Compared to previous recommendations, the ESRB covers a larger array of financial institutions, including banks, investment firms, insurance companies and CCPs. Unlike previous recommendations, the ESRB refers to all voluntary pay-outs that have the effect of reducing the quality or quantity of own funds, including dividends, share buy-backs and variable remuneration to material risk-takers (staff members whose professional activities have material impact on the institutions' risk profile) and thus goes beyond previous recommendations. And unlike some recommendations issued by other European regulators, the recommended restrictions apply until the end of 2020. They can also be extended further.

While such restrictions intervene in ownership and management rights, there are strong arguments for them in times of crisis.
• Banks constitute a critical sector for economic recovery, so there is a need to maintain a sufficiently high capitalisation. There are good reasons why such a decision cannot be left to shareholders themselves: the direct effect of pay-outs on the resolvability of banks, the severe externalities in the event of a bank’s failure, and the fiscal and other measures put in place by authorities during the COVID-19 crisis which limit losses for banks’ shareholders and could encourage more risk-taking than optimal from society’s viewpoint.
• With governments using various means to support companies during the lockdown, shareholders and senior management should not shift capital allocation for the benefit of their own personal wealth. In the case of banks, regulators have provided significant capital relief (€120 billion for significant institutions under direct ECB supervision), which would be partly offset by pay-outs.
• Mitigating procyclicality. Banks behave in a procyclical manner in their lending. During recessions and times of crisis, banks show a propensity to build reserves against credit losses and reduce lending, with this reduction in lending being caused by an increase in information asymmetries between borrowers and lenders and a reduction in collateral values (e.g. Bernanke et al. 1999). Other sources of procyclical behaviour are accounting standards (Laeven and Majnoni 2003) and capital regulation requiring higher risk weights (Brei and Gambacorta 2016). High capital buffers can partly mitigate this tendency towards deleveraging. This in turn suggests that pay-outs should be suspended so as not to offset the effect of using these capital buffers.
• Avoiding stigma and a race to the bottom: If banks use dividend payments as a signal of strength to the market, then any bank not paying dividends will fear being stigmatised. This is another argument in favour of coordinated and mandatory action to restrict pay-outs (Bernanke 2009).
• Charities, foundations, pension funds and retail investors often depend on steady dividend income. While in a complete market shareholders would be able to sell their shares and thus receive equivalent income, this is a suboptimal strategy in the current volatile times.
• The prohibition of pay-outs could limit resource reallocation that might be needed during the recovery stage. This represents an argument in favour of limiting the period for which restrictions are applied.
• Banning dividend payments may undermine the relationship between a bank and its investors. This could potentially restrict the bank’s future access to market funding. Capital instruments subject to the restrictions might become less attractive to investors, particularly compared with instruments of entities in jurisdictions that do not impose such restrictions. In turn, this could reduce the ability of the affected banks to raise additional capital, or it could increase their cost of capital. This represents another argument in favour of limiting the period for which a restriction on pay-outs is in place.

To assess the impact of system-wide restrictions on dividends, we considered the stock market reaction on Monday 30 March 2020 to the ECB recommendation published on Friday 27 March 2020 addressed only to significant institutions directly under the supervision of the ECB. Their share prices suffered only a limited additional fall (of around 80 basis points) compared with the fall in the share prices of European banks not supervised by the ECB, although effects on individual institutions varied. Larger banks tended to be more affected by the dividend restrictions. Stock prices of euro area global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) dropped by 280 basis points more than the stock prices of non-euro area G-SIIs. Banks’ own announcements also seem to have had an impact on their stock prices. Over a relatively short time frame (one day), large banks that announced dividend cancellations tended to underperform the broader banking index (EURO STOXX Banks) by between 161 and 539 basis points. The greater impact of individual bank announcements clearly points to the stigma effect outlined above. This would suggest a need for coordinated action rather than relying on individual bank initiatives.

While the above arguments relate primarily to banks, (re-)insurers are also likely to suffer losses from the COVID-19 crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant losses in financial markets, including steep falls in stock markets, across-the-board spread widening and swap-rate tightening. COVID-19 could be seen as a ‘triple-hit’ scenario, combining market shocks in the form of an increase in risk premia and a decrease in the risk-free rate affecting both sides of insurers’ balance sheets and additional insurance-specific shocks. Given the important role of insurance and reinsurance companies in financial markets (European insurance companies hold around €10 trillion in assets), and the expected severity of the financial crisis following the COVID-19 pandemic, which is potentially comparable to stress test scenarios applied in recent European stress tests, it is important to maintain own funds and capital buffers to safeguard the resilience of the insurance sector. In light of these concerns, the ESRB decided to include (re-)insurers in its recommendation on restricting pay-outs.

CCPs now play a key role in clearing financial market transactions and are a major segment of the financial sector. It is therefore important that they maintain adequate prefunded own resources in addition to initial margins and default funds. As in the case of banks and (re)insurance companies, investor rights have to be weighed against financial stability concerns. In addition, it is important to note that while CCPs are not directly involved in real-sector funding, their critical role in financial market transactions means that banks and insurance companies rely on them for their hedging activities.

The recommendation calls for restrictions on the consolidated level, but on the sub-consolidated level if the parent bank is outside the EU. Ideally there would be cooperation on the global level. As this has not happened, the ESRB saw the need to primarily take care of the European financial system. Therefore, the recommendation primarily targets pay-out restrictions at the EU consolidated level. One tricky issue has been restrictions at the sub-consolidated and individual level within the EU, several Central and Eastern European countries already having imposed restrictions on subsidiaries of EU cross-border banks for financial stability concerns.

There are strong arguments on either side. On the one hand, regulatory risk-sharing is incomplete in the EU (including within the eur"|2
2020-06-24|"Today the European Commission’s independent Group of Chief Scientific Advisors (GCSA), the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) and Peter Piot, special advisor to the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, published a joint statement on scientific advice to European policy makers concerning the COVID-19 pandemic.

President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen said:

Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, Mariya Gabriel said:

The statement provides guidance for the provision of scientific advice in pandemic situations that are characterised by complexity and uncertainty. To ensure efficient and effective policies, advice should be multi-disciplinary, and provided through early and frequent exchange with policy-makers. Transparency and openness are crucial. Clarity on what is known, what is not known, and what cannot be known is very important as illustrated by debate around the use of facemasks, the ability of children to spread the disease, or the maximum level of protection offered by a possible vaccine. Also critical is that there is a clear distinction between advice, decision making and implementation roles.

The statement also announces two forthcoming jointly authored scientific opinions that will make recommendations for better pandemic preparedness and management and on crisis resilience in general.

The statement draws on the principles described by the GCSA Opinion “Scientific Advice to European Policy in a Complex World” (September 2019) and the EGE Statement “European Solidarity and Protection of Fundamental Rights in the COVID-19 Pandemic” (April 2020).

The European Commission’s Group of Chief Scientific Advisors (GCSA) contribute to the quality of EU legislation through the provision of independent scientific advice to the Commission. The Advisors are seven eminent scientists, appointed in their personal capacities and who advise the Members of the European Commission on issues of public interest. The Advisors work closely with the Scientific Advice for Policy by European Academies (SAPEA) consortium, which gathers interdisciplinary expertise from over 100 academies and societies across Europe. A summary of the Advisors’ previous publications and their impact can be found in their February 2020 report, ‘Informing European Commission Policy Making with Scientific Evidence’.

On the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies

The European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) is an independent, multi-disciplinary body appointed by the President of the European Commission. The EGE advises on all aspects of Commission policies and legislation where ethical, societal and fundamental rights dimensions intersect with the development of science and new technologies. The latest statement was issued on 2 April 2020, on European Solidarity and the Protection of Fundamental Rights in the COVID-19 Pandemic.

The special advisor to the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, on the response to the coronavirus and COVID-19

Virologist Prof Peter Piot is special advisor to the President Ursula Von der Leyen on the response to the coronavirus and COVID-19. In this role, he advises the Commission in supporting and steering research and innovation in the global fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and Handa Professor of Global Health, co-discovered the Ebola virus in Zaire in 1976 and also led pioneering research on HIV-AIDS, women’s health and infectious diseases, mostly in Africa. He later directed the United Nations AIDS programme for ten years. The former Under Secretary-General of the UN is also member of the scientific advisory panel that provides the Commission with recommendations on response to the pandemic; including policy measures for addressing its long-term consequences."|2
2020-06-24|"A new parent group has organized to put pressure on school districts to embrace anti-racist curriculum and instruction. Its first action, which begins today, aims to inundate 10 school districts, from California to Connecticut, with emails demanding change.

Racial Equity Education is small: About 10 friends, all Black, white, Jewish or Asian parents of K-12 students, and connected through Facebook, put the group together earlier this month.

But it has big dreams. It wants students, parents, and community members to pile so many emails in the inboxes of key district leaders in 10 cities that they'll have to sit up and take notice.

""If you're hearing tens of thousands of folks singing the same song, in chorus, saying the time for change is now, it's harder to ignore"" than one petition that lands on a leader's desk, said Gigi, who works in adult education in Seattle and is one of the group's founders.

Gigi and the group's other members insist that their last names be withheld for their safety. Where they live, in Milwaukee, Boston, Buffalo, N.Y., Seattle and other cities, they've already seen violence and verbal abuse toward demonstrators protesting police shootings. And they've had a couple of hateful comments posted in their Facebook group, Gigi said. (The group moderators have since deleted them.) 



Getting the Message Out

In its first wave of activism, Racial Equity Education is targeting the Seattle, Highline, and Puyallup districts in Washington state; East Baton Rouge, La.; Buffalo, N.Y.; Frederick County, Md.; Newtown, Conn.; and three districts in California: Oakland Unified, Glendale, and Placentia-Yorba Linda.

Racial Equity Education chose those 10 districts because it knew there were already students or community members lobbying for anti-racist curriculum there, so they could build on those efforts, Gigi said. The group included East Baton Rouge, La., because of a video that went viral, showing activist Gary Chambers Jr., accusing a local school board member of shopping online while he made an impassioned plea for the board to rename a high school that's named after Confederate General Robert E. Lee.

The new group's playbook is twofold: It will send demand letters to school board members, PTA presidents, and local teachers' unions in 10 districts. But it's also posted links to a letter template and sample emails that people can use to lobby these—or any other—school districts.

Their two-page letter demands that schools include ""Black experience, voices and history"" in their curricula. It argues for a well-rounded K-12 ethnic studies curriculum, citing a 2011 paper by the National Education Association that argues that students of all races and ethnic backgrounds benefit from such study. And it asks board members and other leaders to engage in discussions about anti-bias training for teachers, ways to hire more Black and brown teachers, and other changes related to racial equity.

In many of the 10 districts that are the focus of Racial Equity's new campaign, students are already circulating petitions demanding that their districts do a better job of building a curriculum that includes examination of systemic racism.

Laura Durante is one of those students. A brand-new graduate of Middletown High School South, in Middletown, N.J., the 18-year-old and a friend started an online petition to ask their district to commit to expand the lens through which it teaches history to include more study of Black, indigenous and LGBTQ people.

""To continue to teach in a manner that blatantly ignores the histories and cultures of both Black and Indigenous people and their oppression is doing the next generation of leaders a grand disservice,"" the letter says.

It's gathered more than 800 signatures since it was posted on June 13, Durante said. Five days later, District Superintendent William O. George III responded with a public letter of his own, offering further conversation. ""We must ask ourselves if we can do better,"" he wrote.

Durante said she started the petition drive because she feels she missed important learning in her predominantly white school system.

""We get this starry, white-washed, colonialist version of history,"" she said. ""Both world and European history are taught through the eyes of white settlers, and that's a very narrow view of how things are.""

Seeing the pileup of signatures, and the district's response, makes Durante feel hopeful. ""I haven't usually felt I've had a voice [in school decisions], but this letter showed me that maybe this is something we can change.""

Activists who work with school districts on instruction about civics and race report that they're seeing an uptick of interest in anti-bias training and anti-racist teaching.

Jill Bass, the chief education officer at the Mikva Challenge, a national organization that helps teachers learn to plan ""action civics"" projects that engage students in the community, said she's ""getting a lot of calls"" from teachers and district administrators about how those projects dovetail with anti-racist curriculum.

She's also seeing administrators feeling readier than they were last year to take the risk to jump into controversial subject matter, Bass said. ""If the desire was there before, now there's a huge fan on that fire, giving it oxygen,"" she said.

Trudy Delhey sees that change from her post as the K-12 social studies supervisor for the Cobb County school district in Georgia. Teachers are increasingly asking for help with culturally responsive teaching, she said. And her district is moving full-force into training on an updated Mikva Challenge curriculum that dives deeply into how power and privilege shape social identity, she said.

""We're maxing out with it, and we weren't ready for that before,"" Delhey said. ""COVID and [concerns about] policing have exposed the inequities people experience. There's this instant understanding that's translated into teachers being more reflective about what they have to do to better serve students.""

Gigi homeschools her two children because, as an Afro-Latina, she found the ""Eurocentric curriculum"" in the local schools unacceptable, and ""harmful to the self-esteem of Black and brown children,"" she said. (Seattle, where she lives, is working on a K-12 ethnic studies curriculum.)



She hand-picked a list of resources for teachers that highlight the historic and cultural contributions of Black people. But it's a short list, and her group recommends that districts work with consultants to build out a full curriculum.

2020-06-24|"What do recoveries from past US recessions teach us about the recovery from the pandemic recession?

The global COVID-19 pandemic has led to job loss of catastrophic proportions in the United States. This column looks at recoveries from recessions over past 70 years to assess how the US labour market might recover from this job loss of unprecedented magnitude. Remarkably consistent recoveries have occurred in the US after every recessionary shock that caused a spike in unemployment, and there are reasons to believe that the recovery from the current shock will be more rapid, because unemployment contains a much larger fraction of workers on temporary layoff than in previous recoveries. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty about the possible recovery rate.

The global pandemic has led to job loss of catastrophic proportions in the United States. From February to April of this year, employment fell by 21 million, or more than 13%. In May, a small recovery occurred, and observers are reasonably confident that the recovery will continue, at least until a possible second round of the pandemic occurs. How will the labour market recover from job loss of such an unprecedented magnitude? We have been studying data from the labour market during recoveries from past recessions, along with the most recent data from the current recovery, to address this important question.

The business cycle involves variations in aggregate slack, and the best measure of slack is the unemployment rate (Romer and Romer 2019). A well-documented property of the unemployment rate – most recently confirmed by Dupraz et al. (2019) – is that unemployment rises rapidly in response to a significant aggregate adverse shock and then gradually recovers, until the next recessionary shock hits, or the unemployment rate reaches about 3.5% of the labour force.

In a recent paper (Hall and Kudlyak 2020), we study data from the labour market during recoveries from the recessions over past 70 years. It is a remarkable fact about the historical US business cycle that, after unemployment reached its peak in a recession and a recovery began, the annual reduction in the unemployment rate was stable at around 0.85 percentage points per year. The economy seems to have had an irresistible force toward restoring full employment.

Figure 1 depicts the change of the unemployment rate for individual recoveries, in percentage points. The blue bar shows the annual rate of decline in percentage points of unemployment and the red bar shows the total percentage-point decline during the recovery. The height of the blue bars was lower than earlier for the recoveries beginning in 1992 and 2003, but the annual rate was second highest of all recoveries in the recovery that just ended; and the total recovery from 2010 to 2020 was the greatest over the 70-year history. The uniformity of the annual rates of recovery in this figure is striking.

Figure 1 Average annual rates of decline in unemployment in percentage points, by recovery, and total decline during each recovery

Figure 2 shows the unemployment rate with the recession spells left blank. Our two observations about recoveries are apparent in the data: unemployment declines smoothly but slowly throughout most recoveries most of the time; and unemployment declines along a straight line, not one that curves upward. The actual path is close to linear.

Figure 2 The paths of unemployment during recoveries

Spike in job loss in recessions does not fully account for subsequent lingering unemployment

We document substantial but short-lived spikes of job loss in recessions using four measures of job loss: (1) layoffs from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, which represent employer-initiated termination of a worker without prejudice, typically because continuing employment has become unprofitable; (2) job destruction in the Business Dynamics Statistics data, which is defined as the sum of all establishment-level reductions in employment (Davis et al. 2013); (3) worker displacement from the Current Population Survey (CPS) Displaced Worker Supplement, which measures job loss among workers with at least three years of tenure at the lost job; and (4) unemployment insurance claims.

We then examine the relationship between the magnitude of the increase in unemployment following a recession shock and the measures of job loss. We conclude, from data on displaced workers collected every two years in the CPS, that the number of workers displaced even in the severe recession starting in 2007 was not enough to explain the volume of excess unemployment present in the US economy during the period from 2009 through 2014. Something happened in the labour market during that period that caused elevated unemployment among workers who were not displaced around 2009.

Figure 3 shows that the spike in layoffs more than fully accounts for the spike in unemployment in 2009 but cannot account for all of the excess unemployment afterwards. That is, the excess job loss accounts for the magnitude of the initial increase in unemployment, but not its persistence. The persistence is too large to be explained as reflecting only the personal experiences of the extra job-losers dating from the spike. The direct channel is only part of the story of persistent high unemployment after the crisis.

Figure 3 Unemployment from excess job loss in 2009 and total excess unemployment, by four measures of job loss (in thousands of workers)

We examine the puzzles of low recovery speed and linear recovery paths in the framework of the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides (DMP) model. Our view of the labour market has points in common with Pries (2004) and can be seen as responding to the challenge of Cole and Rogerson (1999) to explain how aggregate unemployment recovers much more slowly than does an individual spell of unemployment.

A typical recession shock permanently destroys firm-worker relationships. The ensuing reemployment process involves multiple short-term employment spells before the unemployed find new permanent jobs. We calculate the effective exit rate from unemployment, which is lower than the individual exit rate from unemployment spells from one month to the next. Those individual exits are frequently temporary departures from the labour force or short-term jobs, and are then followed by additional spells of unemployment, as described in an earlier paper of ours (Hall and Kudlyak 2019).

We believe our findings are relevant for the recovery that is expected to follow the deep recession triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, but we do not try to predict how the recovery will evolve. In particular, our work should not be interpreted as a forecast that unemployment will decline as slowly in the coming recovery as it has in past recoveries. Our work is complementary to that of Gregory et al. (2020) in this respect.

A major difference between the current and past recessions is that the overwhelming majority of currently unemployed workers anticipate being recalled to jobs from which they have been temporarily laid off, within the coming six months (Kudlyak and Wolcott 2020). We perceive two polar outcomes resulting from the unusual preponderance of workers on temporary layoff.

In the best outcome, their expectations about recall are fulfilled. They return to their existing jobs rapidly without sacrificing their job-specific human capital (Fujita and Moscarini 2017). Only a small fraction of the large number of people laid off from the pandemic actually enter traditional unemployment. Their unemployment declines at around one percentage point per year, but that results in the correction of the relatively small bulge of non-temporary-layoff unemployment over only a few years.

In the worst outcome, the majority of workers currently on temporary layoff fail to be recalled and therefore become unemployed in the traditional sense. They undergo the same time-consuming process of searching for work, taking short-term jobs, and experiencing spells out of the labour market, that we have described in our work on the slow recovery of unemployment after the recessions from 1948 through 2009. The implications of this outcome are alarming: The US unemployment rate is currently about 14%, say 9 percentage points above normal. It would take 11 years (9 divided by 0.85) to work off the pandemic’s bulge of unemployment as it currently stands.

The coming months will teach us a lot about where the US economy stands between these two polar outcomes. Most observers believe that unemployment will decline in coming months by at least one percentage point per month, or at an annual rate of 12 percentage points per year, far above the historical recovery rate. One study, by Barrero et al. (2020), is pessimistic about the likelihood of successful recalls for a large fraction of those currently on temporary layoff. On the other hand, in the Current Population Survey, between April and May, only a small fraction of those on temporary layoff reported a change to traditional unemployment. Petrosky-Nadeau and Valetta (2020) investigate a number of differences between unemployment dynamics in the pandemic recession and prior recessions.

Our research concludes that the economy has a strong internal force toward recovery. Remarkably consistent recoveries have occurred in the US after every recessionary shock that caused a spike in unemployment. We make the case that the internal force originates in the labour market. Historically, the force has delivered only modest annual declines of unemployment. We have reasons to believe that the recovery from the pandemic shock will be more rapid, because unemployment contains a much larger fraction of workers on temporary layoff than in previous recoveries. But there is a great deal of uncertainty about the forthcoming recovery rate.

• None Hang Seng Index extends rally as tech gains. It faces an immediate resistance at 25,000
• None Singapore’s PM announced a general election to be held on 10
• None are extending gains to US$ 1767

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index stock market benchmark surged 1.6% yesterday, marking it one of the best performing indices across the Asia-Pacific region. The rally was mainly driven by technology giant Tencent (+4.89%), which accounts for around 11.2% of the index’s weight (table below). Financial stocks AIA (+2.46) and HSBC (+2.04%) were doing well too.

As discussed in an earlier report, the draft of Hong Kong’s security law is unlikely to bring a material impact to the Hang Seng Index, which is heavily weighted toward mainland corporations. In fact, the implementation of a national security may even help to contain violence in the street, and thus from a economic point of view, to bring social stability to the financial hub.

Technology firms, including Tencent, Meituan, Alibaba and JD.com have benefited from the Covid-19 pandemic, as more consumers seek e-commerce, gaming, streaming and other digital services. The rally in tech stocks shows no sign of ending soon.

US stock markets closed higher overnight, setting a positive tone for the Asia-Pacific open. Among the S&P 500 sectors, consumer discretionary (+1.04%), information technology (0.70%), communication (+0.61%) and health care (+0.44%) were the best performing ones, whereas utilities (-1.06%), real estate (-0.35%) and consumer staples (-0.14%) were lagging behind last night.

The Hang Seng Index is challenging a key resistance level at 25,000, which it failed to break above in early May and June. Will a tech rally empower it with momentum for a meaningful breakout? The next few days are critical.

The 20-day SMA has crossed above the 50- and 100-Day SMAs, signaling the formation of ‘golden cross’ should the price hold above 24,000. An immediate support level could be found at 24,100 – the 38.2% Fibonacci extension.

The Straits Times Index stock market benchmark has been consolidating at the 2,600-2,650 area for two weeks. Investors are cautious about a potential second viral wave in major economies and its ramification for the recovery in growth. SGX daily trading volume has also shrank alongside share prices, undermining risk appetite.

The announcement of a general election to be held on 10th July didn’t bring much of a surprise and volatility to Singapore’s stock market. An election now will give the new government a fresh five-year mandate to focus on imminent Covid issues and long term development plans.

Technically, the index has found a strong support at 2,600, where its 50- and 100-Day SMAs cross.

Yesterday, gold price had a meaningful breakout above US$ 1,750 – a major resistance level. The rally seemed to have legs as the US Dollar Index continued to drift lower. Rising demand for inflation-hedge assets is probably another key driver behind gold prices.

Gold prices have likely broken out above an ‘Ascending Triangle’ after piercing through US$ 1,750. It has now opened room for more upside towards US$ 1,800 and then US$ 1,870 – the 161.8% Fibonacci extension. The MACD indicator suggests there could be more upside in the near term.

2020-06-24|"President Volodymyr Zelenskyi calls on Ukrainians working abroad to return to the country

Vitaliy Makhinko, from the Ukrainian Migrant trade union, believes it’s impossible to make estimates with any certainty. Some experts, such as demographer Ella Libanova, gave alternative estimates, claiming that between 450,000 and 500,000 migrants may have returned.

“There’s no data on migrants. Alongside workers, many students have also returned from abroad. How can we separate them from [labour] migrants in the statistics?” Makhinko asks.

Remittances from migrant workers are an important source of income for Ukraine. In 2019, Ukrainian labour migrants transferred more than US$12.2 billion to Ukraine, amounting to 7.8% of the country’s GDP. This is a record number since the National Bank started maintaining statistics in 2015. Most of the money - $3.68 billion (almost 31% of all funds transferred into the country) - came from Poland.

But the Ukrainian government has temporarily banned migrant workers from leaving the country during quarantine, including refusing permission for European countries to transport Ukrainians for seasonal work in charter planes - causing a sizable public scandal in the process.

As a result, there’s a hostile mood among some Ukrainian migrant workers towards government efforts to prevent them from leaving the country. They have few job prospects, and cannot receive state financial assistance for temporary unemployment (most of them never get an employment contract). Those who want to go back to work, or those who planned to go for seasonal work abroad in May in any case, are travelling anyway - even if a taxi journey is much more expensive than traditional transport.

“There are no offers on the Ukrainian labour market for returning migrants,” Oleg Borisov says. “In addition, they cannot do the same work they did abroad - service, care, construction and agriculture - because those sectors aren’t as developed here as in Europe.""

Europe wants Ukrainian workers - even more so, it turns out, due to the pandemic. The number of available migrants from the poorest countries inside the EU like Romania and Bulgaria is not sufficient, and some EU states are trying to bring Ukrainians to their countries to harvest crops. Around 200 Ukrainians, despite the official position, have already flown to Finland for seasonal work - on a charter flight organised by a Finnish company looking for workers. Ukraine has received similar diplomatic requests from Germany, Italy and Poland. The authorities agreed to consider every application from each country separately in order to permit migrant workers to travel.

But the Ukrainian government is reluctant. In April, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba stated it is ‘illogical to organise mass charter flights at the same time to export Ukrainians to countries where pandemic is ongoing’.

Poland appears to be the most interested in Ukrainian workers, as the majority of them were already working there before the pandemic (almost 12% of all workers). Poland has the most liberal legislation of work permits for Ukrainians and relies on them heavily, with a National Bank study estimating their contribution to 11% of Poland’s GDP between 2014 and 2018."|0
2020-06-24|"In mid-April, Finn Gnadt, an 18-year-old student from Kiel, Germany, learnt that he had been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus despite feeling well. Gnadt’s parents had fallen ill after a river cruise in Austria, so his family was tested for virus antibodies, which are produced in response to infection.

Gnadt thought he had endured the infection unscathed, but days later, he started to feel worn out and exceedingly thirsty. In early May, he was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and his physician, Tim Hollstein at the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein in Kiel, suggested that the sudden onset might be linked to the viral infection.

In most people with type 1 diabetes, the body’s immune cells start destroying β-cells — which are responsible for producing the hormone insulin — in the pancreas, often suddenly. In Gnadt’s case, Hollstein suspected that the virus had destroyed his β-cells, because his blood didn’t contain the types of immune cells that typically damage the pancreatic islets where the β-cells live.

Coronavirus and COVID-19: Keep up to date

Diabetes is already known to be a key risk factor for developing severe COVID-191 and people with the condition are more likely to die2. “Diabetes is dynamite if you get COVID-19,” says Paul Zimmet, who studies the metabolic disease at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.

Now Zimmet is among a growing number of researchers who think that diabetes doesn’t just make people more vulnerable to the coronavirus, but that the virus might also trigger diabetes in some3. “Diabetes itself is a pandemic just like the COVID-19 pandemic. The two pandemics could be clashing,” he says.

Their hunch is based on a handful of people such as Gnadt, who have spontaneously developed diabetes4 after being infected with SARS-CoV-2, and on evidence from dozens more people with COVID-19 who have arrived in hospital with extremely high levels of blood sugar and ketones5, which are produced from fatty deposits in the liver. When the body doesn’t make enough insulin to break down sugar, it uses ketones as an alternative source of fuel. “In science, sometimes you have to start off with very small evidence to chase a hypothesis,” says Zimmet.

Researchers cite other evidence, too. Various viruses, including the one that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), have been linked with autoimmune conditions such as type 1 diabetes6. And many organs involved in controlling blood sugar are rich in a protein called ACE2, which SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect cells7.

The latest clue comes from an experimental study in miniature lab-grown pancreases published last week8 suggests that the virus might trigger diabetes by damaging the cells that control blood sugar.

Mini organs reveal how the coronavirus ravages the body

But other researchers are cautious about such suggestions. “We need to keep an eye on diabetes rates in those with prior COVID-19, and determine if rates go up over and above expected levels,” says Naveed Sattar, a metabolic-disease researcher at the University of Glasgow, UK.

To establish a link, researchers need more robust evidence, says Abd Tahrani, a clinician–scientist at the University of Birmingham, UK. “Well-constructed epidemiological cohort studies and mechanistic and experimental studies are needed,” he says.

One initiative is now under way. Earlier this month, an international group of scientists, including Zimmet, established a global database3 to collect information on people with COVID-19 and high blood-sugar levels who do not have a history of diabetes or problems controlling their blood sugar.

Cases are beginning to trickle in, says Stefan Bornstein, a physician at the Technical University of Dresden, Germany, who also helped to establish the registry. The researchers hope to use the cases to understand whether SARS-CoV-2 can induce type 1 diabetes or a new form of the disease. And they want to investigate whether the sudden-onset diabetes becomes permanent in people who’ve had COVID-19. They also want to know whether the virus can tip people who were already on their way to developing type 2 diabetes into a diabetic state.

Coronavirus breakthrough: dexamethasone is first drug shown to save lives

The study in pancreatic organoids shows how SARS-CoV-2 could be damaging the organ8. Shuibing Chen, a stem-cell biologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, and her colleagues showed that the virus can infect the organoid’s α- and β-cells, some of which then die. Whereas β-cells produce insulin to decrease blood-sugar levels, α-cells produce the hormone glucagon, which increases blood sugar. The virus can also induce the production of proteins known as chemokines and cytokines, which can trigger an immune response that might also kill the cells, according to the study8 published in Cell Stem Cell on 19 June.

Chen says the experiments suggest that the virus can disrupt the function of key cells involved in diabetes — either by directly killing them or by triggering an immune response that attacks them.

The virus also attacked pancreatic organoids that had been transplanted into mice, and cells in liver organoids. The liver is important for storing and releasing sugar into the blood stream when it senses insulin.

The organoid study8 adds strength to the argument that SARS-CoV-2 might cause or worsen diabetes, but the paper itself is not enough to prove the link, says Tahrani.

There could be more going on than some scientists suggest, says Shane Grey, an immunologist at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Sydney, Australia. The virus could trigger an extreme inflammatory state, which would impair the ability of the pancreas to sense glucose and release insulin, and dampen the ability of the liver and muscles to detect the hormone, he says. This could trigger diabetes.

Fatigue and muscle loss caused by severe infection can also push people at risk of the condition into a pre-diabetic state, says Sattar. Only long-term studies will reveal what’s really going on, he says."|1
2020-06-25|"Kate and Michael Tosswill with their children on their Wairarapa farm

The banana bread is in the oven, ready to feed the shearers and rousies working hard on Kate and Michael Tosswill's farm, north-east of Masterton.

Only 800 of the 6500 strong flock of Romney will be sheared today. Then the wool will travel around the North Island to other small businesses, being turned into yarn, then home wares and garments, which were designed at Kate's kitchen table.

Just before Covid-19, Kate launched Hipi, an small business dedicated to sustainable and ethical practices, allowing consumers to follow the path the wool takes from the paddock to the purl.

“At first [Covid-19] seemed like an end-of-the-world disaster,” she said.

“But quickly we saw there was a change in the consumer trends and it strengthened what we were doing in terms of New Zealand made, sustainable, environmentally friendly products that have a story behind them.

“Buying once and buying to last.”

The former nurse and her husband purchased Bagshot Farm, a 586 hectare working sheep and beef farm in 2017. She's a keen knitter and has an eye for design, so it made sense to launch the business.

“It goes back to knitting, I've been knitting for nearly 10 years now,” she said.

“As a knitter you know ... the magic of wool. And we've got such a love of farming ... so we rolled it altogether.

“We were stoked to find if we used the best of the best of what we produced we could make some beautiful things that had a look and feel of hand knitting.”

Her company now engages with 14 other New Zealand family owned small and medium enterprises [SMEs]

Once the flock has been sheared, the wool is sent to Napier where it's spun then to a second generation family manufacturer in Auckland who machines the yarn into products – including pillows and winter clothing – before it's sent back to Kate who adds the final hand made leather components. All products get sent out the gate in a compostable bag.

“One of the best things of the journey is the people we've made connections with. They've put their own expertise in, and they are all really passionate. It's a collaboration,” she said.

“It's not just about us, and it's certainly not just an economic venture. There's some great industry good coming out of it.”

Creating a business like Hipi has benefits for not only farmers but the wool industry as a whole, which has battled with low prices, she said.

“As an industry, if we can make headway and promote strong wool then that's got a much wider benefit for farmers,” she said.

“It's a real opportunity within the strong wool space. Merino is doing some pretty great things but it's what we might be able to do with strong wool that gets quite exciting.”

Sales have been “chugging away” since the website went up, but she knows it's a challenging time for a lot of New Zealanders, and products like hers might not be top of mind.

“[But] we're finding a lot of people are buying [the products] as gifts. Whether that's wedding presents, anniversary presents, or birthday presents, particularly for that person who seems to have everything,” she said.

She's also looking to expand into baby blankets for her next range. Thinking outside the box will help the survival of the industry, she said.

“The one thing is intriguing is the face of farming is changing and what it takes to be a farmer is changing. It's lovely to challenge the norm and traditional ideas of what a farmer looks, walks, talks and smells like,” she said.

“Being a farmer [means] you're running a pretty big business, so there's a lot of skills that other farmers could bring into being more entrepreneurial.”

But for now, it's back to the banana bread and shearing shed for Tosswill, who used to be a rousie, but her career was cut short, ironically, because of a lanolin allergy.

“Food is like legal tender. You can show so much with a little cake. It's nice to be able to look after them. They do so much for us,” she said."|2
2020-06-25|"Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov was the problem Novak Djokovic’s parents say, after a coronavirus outbreak related to series of exhibition matches hosted by the top-ranked player.

The alarming outbreak of Covid-19 at Novak Djokovic's Adria Tour has now been followed by a finger-pointing exchange between Djokovic's father, Srdjan, and Grigor Dimitrov's agent over where the -infection might have stemmed from.

When Srdjan Djokovic accused Dimitrov of being the source, agent Georgi Stoimenov suggested that the tournament organisers were ""the ones responsible for the safe running of the event"". There was also an intervention from Nick Kyrgios, the most vocal locker-room critic of the Adria Tour.

Writing on Twitter, Kyrgios posted an image of Srdjan Djokovic accompanied by his quotes on Dimitrov and said: ""Nah bruh, don't push the blame.""

In an interview with a Croatian broadcast channel, Srdjan Djokovic said: ""Why did it all happen? It happened because the man [Dimitrov] came sick from who knows where. He did not get tested here, and he was tested elsewhere.""

 * Tennis star Novak Djokovic tests positive for coronavirus



According to Srdjan Djokovic's narrative, Dimitrov could have been what epidemiologists call a ""superspreader"", having flown in to Belgrade in time for the start of the Adria Tour on June 13.

This was hardly the only possible explanation, especially given the intermingling of athletes from other sports with the tennis players. Nikola Jankovic was one of several basketball players who tested positive after a derby match between Red Star and Partizan, which Djokovic attended on June 10.

Another positive test was confirmed yesterday involving Serbian basketball player Nikola Jokic. He is an All-NBA centre who plays for the Denver Nuggets, and has now been forced to delay his return to the United States.

According to reports, Jokic spent time with Djokovic at the Belgrade leg of the Adria Tour.

Stoimenov said: ""Grigor landed directly in Belgrade after three months' complete isolation. Neither in Belgrade or later in Zadar [the Croatian city that hosted the second leg of the Adria Tour] was he offered or required to test for coronavirus.

The event organisers are the ones responsible for the safe running of the event and creating rules to follow. Grigor strictly respected all the rules imposed by the organisers and the existing laws and regulations in the crossing of the border between Bulgaria, Serbia and Croatia.""

Dimitrov, the world No 19, is -understood to have remained in California between the cancellation of Indian Wells on March 8 and his flight to Belgrade. He made a brief visit to his home town of Haskovo in Bulgaria between the Belgrade and Zadar legs of the Adria Tour.

As yet, there are no reports of Covid-19 in Haskovo. Four players - Dimitrov, Djokovic, Borna Coric and Viktor Troicki - have tested positive, along with two coaches and Djokovic's wife, Jelena. In a statement released on Tuesday night, Djokovic said: ""I am so deeply sorry our tournament has done harm.""

Dimitrov does not seem to have been completely asymptomatic, at least by the end of his time in Zadar. He was clearly under the weather by the end of Saturday's match with Coric, which he lost comfortably. He did not shake hands, even though that had been normal practice throughout the Adria Tour."|1
2020-06-25|"Lokesh, your research looks at the science of sugars in nature, can you explain?

I’m interested in carbohydrates. By that I don’t mean the sugars we eat, but rather the carbohydrates that help cells to sense and interact with their surroundings. For example, plant and animal cells, bacteria, fungi and virus particles all have protein and carbohydrate structures called glycoproteins on their outer surfaces. These glycoproteins have specific shapes that can lock together in a handshake between the surfaces. If they fit together, this is a form of recognition or sensing.

Does this happen in Covid-19?

Yes, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 has spike-glycoproteins (S-glycoprotein) on its surface, and these can lock onto specific receptors on human cells. This means the virus can get inside our cells. Recent reports suggest that mutations in S-glycoprotein has helped the virus “jump” from animal to human host.

What have you been working on during the pandemic?

One of the technologies I am involved in is a carbohydrate-based molecular “Velcro” to capture pathogens or other agents that could be harmful. I’m the founder of a start-up called Aquila Bioscience, and we have developed a wipe that is coated with carbohydrates that grab hold of bacteria and viruses and potentially dangerous substances.

You can wipe your face and eyes and hands with this wipe, as well as surfaces. It not only removes the agent, but also captures it so it can be tested. We have been working with Defence Forces Ireland and the European Defence Agency on it, and during the pandemic we have shown that the “Velcro” captures all pathogens tested so far. Testing of Covid-19 virus is ongoing in a defence lab in the US. We are now piloting the wipes with frontline agencies.

What else do you look at?

I see living organisms, including our bodies, as incredible sensor systems. We don’t have a dashboard in front of us like in a car to tell us how various parts are performing, but we can look at a molecular level and figure out what is going on in health and disease.

So my lab is looking at the carbohydrates in mucus, a protective barrier that lines surfaces in our bodies. We are also working on a large European project to find carbohydrate signatures in urine that can tell us about a person’s nutrition, and we have been exploring how chronic stress alters carbohydrates in the body.

You are vice-president for research at NUI Galway – what are your thoughts on research in the pandemic?

I think the pandemic has shown the world that we are all deeply connected, and that research is a way out of Covid-19, it is part of the recovery. The pandemic has fostered a wonderful culture of collaboration and I am excited to see, for example, biologists working with data scientists and looking for that deeper understanding of viral infection and our response to it.

But for researchers it is also a time of great uncertainty and stress, and we need to support them and help them face this with resilience as we learn to do our research in new ways.

And finally, what has been keeping you on an even keel during the Covid-19 restrictions?

I am connecting with my family and getting out in the garden and going for walks when possible. I also try to start each day by meditating, to bring a sense of stillness and clarity to myself, and recognising the anxiety around not having as much certainty or control in our lives as we may have thought we did."|2
2020-06-25|"The Japanese government’s policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic was to ask people to refrain from leaving their homes and to encourage teleworking. This column examines the effect of COVID-19 on the uptake of teleworking in a country that has the lowest use among developed countries. Overall, teleworking increased about 4 percentage points from January to March 2020, driven by industries and occupations related to information and located in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Teleworking is not suited to face-to-face services and manual labour, which saw substantial declines in worker incomes.

COVID-19 had spread worldwide by February 2020 and was declared a pandemic in March 2020. In Japan, the number of infections and deaths is much lower than in the US and Europe. Japan has also not completely closed its national borders or locked down its cities, and economic activity has continued.

The government’s policy response has been to request people to refrain from leaving their homes and to encourage telework without any penalties and punishment. This has drawn attention to telework as an effective means to continue work while preventing the spread of infection.

However, Japan has the lowest use of telework among developed countries. Despite strong promotion by government and companies in recent years, the utilisation rate of telework has remained low. Thus, Japan presents an interesting case to investigate how the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic promotes telework (Okubo 2020a,b).

In April 2020, Keio University (Okubo laboratory) and Nippon Institute for Research Advancement conducted a survey on telework, “Questionnaire Survey on the effects of the Spread of the COVID-19 on Telework-based Work Styles, Lifestyle, and Awareness”. The sample is 10,516 workers living in Japan. The questionnaire asks about the employment status, living situation, and awareness of workers as of January and March 2020.

In general, telework refers to a way of working that is not bound by time and space, using information and communications technology (ICT). In our survey, telework is defined as working at a specific place (at home or in public facilities) for hours using ICT. We therefore do not include the use of ICT devices at locations such as train stations, airports, transportation facilities, and the premises of business partners.

We find that the national average telework utilisation rate as of March 2020 was 10%, while it was 6% in January. The utilisation rate increased by about 4 percentage points only in two months. Further findings are as follows:

1. The most teleworkers are in the information services and the fewest in face-to-face service work and manual labour

By industry, communications and information services (27%) and information services and research (23%) have the highest telework utilisation rates, while restaurants and accommodation (4%) and medical care and welfare (2%) have the lowest rates (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Rate of utilisation of telework by industry category

By occupation, management consultants (51%), researchers (28%), and data processing and communication engineers (25%) see high use of telework, while doctors, dentists, veterinarians, and pharmacists (3%), public health nurses, midwives, and nurses (2%), carrying, cleaning, packaging, and related workers (2%), manufacturing process workers (2%), food and drink/cooking and customer service workers (2%), and construction and mining workers (0%) see low rates (Figure 2).

Thus, industries and occupations related to information have a relatively high rate in the utilisation of telework, while telework is not suited to face-to-face services and manual labour.

In terms of growth from January to March 2020, the rate of telework almost doubled in accounting, clerical work, and sales and retail, showing telework rapidly spread across the entire spectrum of office work. This finding is consistent with evidence from Baker (2020) and Dingel and Neiman (2020).

2. There are more teleworkers in urban areas and fewer in rural areas

The rate of utilising telework differs by region. Figure 3 shows the telework utilisation rate by prefecture. Tokyo has the highest rate at 21%. Teleworking between January and March 2020 largely grew in Tokyo; this is because the Tokyo metropolitan area has a high concentration of white-collar workers in headquarter offices and service industries, all of which are well suited to telework.

While teleworking varies across industries and occupations, the pandemic shock hit specific industries, where worker incomes substantially declined. In particular, occupations less suited to telework and with fewer teleworkers tended to experience a more negative effect from the COVID-19 pandemic shock.

Figure 4 shows the changes in income between January and March by occupational category. Half of the workers in the food, drink, and accommodation industries saw a large decline in income. By contrast, workers in information and communications, research, and public services did not see large declines in income. The occupations that experienced the most significantly negative impact are those with the lowest rates of telework (Figure 1).

Figure 4 Changes in income, by industry

The main means to prevent infection in the current pandemic is to avoid person-to-person contact, and telework has therefore been recommended. While government requests for businesses to suspend their activities have been focused on face-to-face services, in which person-to-person contact is fundamental, tasks in these industries are the least suited to telework. These industries had already suffered significant negative economic impacts, and calling on them to promote telework would only exacerbate the recession by increasing unemployment and business closures.

While economic activities need to be uniformly stopped as a countermeasure against infectious diseases, it is extremely difficult to promote telework in all industries and occupations. It is a typical contradiction between measures against infectious diseases and economic policy. More generous economic assistance will be an urgent requirement to prevent bankruptcies and unemployment in industries and occupations unsuitable to telework.

2020-06-25|"The macroeconomic effects of automation and the role of COVID-19 in reinforcing their dynamics

Over the last decade there has been a tremendous progress in automation. Many tasks previously seen as un-automatable can now be performed without human labour, and the number of industrial robots in use has increased sharply. This column describes the recent trends in automation and argues that its principal effects are to increase output per capita at the expense of rising inequality. Advancing technologies have mainly replaced the routine tasks of low-skilled workers, while the incomes robots generate flow to wealthier capital owners. The current COVID-19 pandemic is likely to reinforce these trends, raising the need for a policy response.

Over the last decade, automation has increasingly been adopted as a full substitution of capital for labour—as opposed to a standard form of labour-augmenting technological change. Figure 1 illustrates this trend, charting the stock of operative industrial robots worldwide over time, based on International Federation of Robotics data (IFR 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019). The number of industrial robots increased by factor of three over the course of a decade, rising from a little over one million operative units in 2010 to a projected 3.15 million units in 2020. Over the same time, robots reportedly became capable of substituting for, or even outperforming, humans for many tasks, such as producing customised parts and medical implants using 3D printing technologies, diagnosing diseases, and assisting decision making, for example, by ‘robot judges’ (Ford 2015, Baldwin 2019, Re and Solow-Niederman 2019). In a just-released book (Prettner and Bloom 2020), we explore theory, evidence, and policy related to the economic and social consequences of the world’s increasing reliance on robots, automated processes, and artificial intelligence.

Notes: Worldwide stock of operative industrial robots in millions of units over time, according to IFR (2016, 2017, 2018, 2019), with our own interpolations for the years lacking data. The solid line refers to actual data and interpolations up to 2018, and the dotted line refers to IFR (2019) forecasts until 2022 .

While automation can (and did) improve productivity, per capita output, and living standards in general (see, for example, Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014, Acemoglu and Restrepo 2018, Graetz and Michaels 2018), two crucial aspects of automation raise concerns: its disproportionate impact on low-skill workers and its overall negative impact with respect to the share of income that goes to labour as opposed to capital. Both of these impacts tend to exacerbate income inequality.

Routine and low-skill tasks continue to be easier for robots to perform than non-routine, high-skill tasks (Arntz et al. 2017, Frey and Osborne 2017, Dauth et al. 2017, Acemoglu and Restrepo 2020). This implies that increases in the number of robots or improvements in their productivity tend to affect low-skilled workers much more adversely than high-skilled workers. Moreover, high-skilled workers tend to specialise in tasks to which automation is complementary, such as robot design and maintenance, supervision, and management. The differential impact of automation implies that the wages of low-skilled workers might stagnate and even decline in the presence of automation (Lankisch et al. 2019). This result is consistent with the data in Figure 2, which shows the real income of persons with a high school degree in the US from 1991 to 2018, according to the US Census Bureau (2020). Simultaneously, high-skilled workers’ wages may rise as a result of automation, potentially increasing wage and income inequality (Piketty 2014, Prettner and Bloom 2020).

Figure 2 Median real income of persons with a high school degree (in USD)

Notes: Median real income in US$ (base year 2018) of persons with a high school degree from 1991 to 2018 in the United States, according to the United States Census Bureau (2020).

When robots constitute a perfect substitute for labour, workers and robots compete directly on the labour market, holding human wages down. The ‘wages’ that robots earn flow to their owners and are therefore capital income. As a consequence, automation leads to a declining labour income share (Prettner 2019, Prettner and Strulik 2020). Because labour income is more equally distributed than capital ownership and capital income are, this leads—mechanically—to a further increase in overall income inequality (see Piketty 2014, Piketty and Zucman 2014). This line of argument is consistent with the trend in the labour income share shown in Figure 3. The labour income share decreased from about 65% in 1970 to below 60% in 2017 (Federal Reserve Bank 2020); at the same time, the number of robots was rising. Of course automation is not the only factor that influences the labour income share, but calibrations suggest that automation could account for an approximate one percentage point decline in the labour income share since the 1970s (Prettner 2019).

Figure 3 Share of labour compensation in GDP in the US

Notes: Share of labour compensation in GDP in the US over time, according to Federal Reserve Bank (2020) data.

To summarise, theoretical arguments and empirical results predating the emergence of COVID-19 indicate that automation has led (and will continue to lead) to (i) increasing productivity and average incomes, (ii) negative employment and wage effects for low-skilled workers, but either insignificant or positive employment and wage effects for high-skilled workers, and (iii) a decline in the labour income share (see also Prettner and Bloom 2020).

Potential policy measures to mitigate the negative consequences of automation include (i) educational investments—particularly in talented individuals from low-income households—such as stipends, tuition-fee waivers, and student housing, (ii) retraining programs for displaced workers, (iii) reforming school curricula to focus more on skills that are complementary to automation technologies and less on memorising facts, (iv) strengthening elements of the social security system that support those who are displaced by robots, such as health insurance coverage for those who are not employed, and (v) reducing taxes on labour and instead increasing taxes on polluting activities or, for example, on undeveloped land.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the assured occurrence of future pandemics foster the adoption of automation technologies and reinforce the previously described patterns. Several factors explain this relationship.

First, automation, robotics, modern information and communication technologies, and artificial intelligence have been incredibly useful in fighting the pandemic, as well as in alleviating its economic consequences. These technologies have allowed firms to continue to operate by facilitating social distancing in the workplace and by enabling remote work from home offices. In general, because better-educated workers with higher incomes can take advantage of these opportunities and many less-educated, lower-income workers cannot, automation and related technologies have translated the COVID-19 shock into greater social and economic inequality, even as they reduce the pandemic’s overall economic impact. The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on disadvantaged ethnic minorities and lower-income individuals—who have poor access to health care and often face higher infection risk due to reliance on public transportation and lack of opportunities to socially distance in the workplace—further magnifies this trend.

Second, the COVID-19 pandemic will likely accelerate the development and implementation of automation technologies because of greater incentives to substitute capital for labour. The reason is that the former is obviously not susceptible to pathogens that affect humans (although they might be quite susceptible to digital pathogens). In addition, working from home might become much more widespread, now that it has been tested on a large scale, acting against the corresponding status quo bias against remote working of firms and bureaucracies.

Third, robots and smart technologies offer great potential for disease surveillance and contact tracing, diagnosing COVID-19 and other diseases without face-to-face contact, and even disinfecting contaminated areas in hospitals and other public spaces (Blake 2020). Consequently, they may help policymakers limit the progression of COVID-19 without (or with only minimal and targeted) lockdown measures.

Fourth, supply chain and travel disruptions caused by COVID-19 might undermine the integration of economies and encourage self-reliant economic systems, at least in (strategically) important sectors such as the production of medical supplies and drugs, or the production of necessary inputs for assembling sophisticated machines, cars, and planes—the final production of which usually still occurs in high-wage countries. While policymakers might hope that the corresponding re-shoring of supply chains could help create jobs for low-skilled workers and thereby raise their wages, theoretical arguments and empirical evidence on re-shoring and automation show that this would instead enhance robot adoption and not improve the lot of low-skilled workers (Krenz et al. 2020).

While automation is likely to foster overall economic prosperity, it comes at the price of increasing inequality. The COVID-19 pandemic is reinforcing both the trend towards automation and its effects. The main challenge here is to ensure that as many as possible will benefit from the positive economic and social effects of automation to prevent a situation in which a substantial part of society is disconnected from the gains brought by technological progress.

2020-06-25|"Thank you for submitting your article ""Comprehensive genetic tools to target motor neurons for each muscle of the fly proboscis"" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Ronald Calabrese as the Reviewing Editor, Senior Editor and Reviewer #2.

The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.

This is a co-submission of two papers. The goal of the first work is achieving genetic control over motor neurons for every muscle of the Drosophila proboscis, and it is accomplished convincingly. The degree of success constructing split Gal4 lines that label only a single bilateral pair of motor neuron corresponding to each muscle of the proboscis is really remarkable, and there is no doubt that these tools will be of tremendous use in defining the neuronal networks responsible for reaching movements of the proboscis and indeed the sucking movements also. The anatomical data presented is beautiful. After achieving genetic control over motor neurons for every muscle of the Drosophila proboscis, the authors in the second work systematically test every motor neuron that inserts on cuticle (including apodemes) and is thus likely to move the proboscis (rather than inserting on the pharynx and likely involved in sucking) with activation and inactivation experiments. By combining kinematics and some biomechanics, the authors arrive at a functional role for each of the proboscis inserting muscle and their motor neurons. The data presented is comprehensive and convincing. When combined these two papers, very clearly supersede a previous attempt (Schwarz et al., 2017) at such tool development and analysis with several important corrections and many major refinements.

Upon careful review of these two co-submitted papers (henceforth referred to a Paper 1 and Paper 2) it was the clear consensus of the reviewers that neither paper alone is strong enough for eLife and we would understand if you chose to take the paper(s) elsewhere. If on the other hand, you chose to submit the two papers to eLife as one joint paper, then we would ensure that they were sent to the same reviewers, and we think that there is a high chance of publication with a short turn-around. No new experiments or analyses are needed.

If you take the eLife route the papers should be combined and focused. One paper will be easier for the authors to present and for the reader to comprehend. One could not read the Paper 2 without constantly referring to Paper 1 and the Paper 2 contains much repetition of the findings of Paper 1.

There are several ways that the papers can be fitted together as detailed in the individual expert reviews.

1) The theme presented for Paper 1 of rhythmic vs. discrete behaviors is not effectively exploited nor can it be given the data presented. Likewise, the comparison to human reaching in Paper 2 seems premature and focusing the combined single paper on the tools developed and the wonderful anatomy and first-pass functional analysis seems more fruitful. The data Figure 9 Paper 1 seems premature and underdeveloped for publication as does the data of Figure 8 Paper 2. They are presented is support of the rhythmic vs. discrete behaviors and human reaching themes and are not compelling. We recommend removing these figures to focus the paper.

2) Efficiency with the figures would help. Figure 1 of Paper 2 could benefit from comparison directly to Figure 1 of Paper 1. Figure 2 of Paper 1 should be supplementary and fits thematically with Paper 2 material. The expert reviews suggest other figure fusions and changes.

3) The data of Figure 7 Paper 1 is reminiscent of data in Schwarz et al., 2017, albeit with corrections but need not be elaborated and could be perhaps combined with Figure 8 Paper 1, which is somewhat underdeveloped.

4) Discussions can be shortened and in Paper 2 shifted away from detailed comparison to in Schwarz et al., 2017.

5) All Essential revisions in the expert reviews should all be addressed.

In two related papers, McKellar and colleagues present the results of a screen to genetically label and optogenetically activate each motor neuron that innervates muscles in the proboscis of Drosophila melanogaster.

In the first manuscript, entitled ""Comprehensive genetic tools to target motor neurons for each muscle of the fly proboscis"", they present genetic driver lines for each motor neuron together with careful anatomy of cuticular structures and musculature. Ten proboscis muscles and their associated motor neurons control the position of proboscis parts and are involved in the proboscis extension response (PER), while the remaining eight muscles control the constriction of the pharynx. In the course of this work, the authors identify several new muscles.

Once the authors develop split-Gal4 genetic labels for each motor neuron, they can drive the expression of CsChrimson to activate, or Tetanus toxin to silence, each motor neuron. They present the results of these experiments in a second paper entitled ""Motor neuron control of Drosophila proboscis reaching"". The main advances of this work are the resulting genetic tools and a more comprehensive knowledge of how particular muscles insert onto cuticular structures to extend or flex proboscis parts about joints. These advances clarify the results of past investigations similar into motor control of the proboscis (in particular, Schwarz, Motor control of Drosophila feeding behavior).

Across both papers, the images of motor neuron and musculature anatomy are illustrative and quite beautiful. Optogenetic activation of individual motor neurons confirms the role each plays in controlling the proboscis segment. Together, these data allow the authors to articulate a model of how motor neuron activation and muscle contraction enables the fly to extend its proboscis.

Although the tools and data in these papers are detailed and valuable, the papers do not effectively show what new insight has been gained relative to previous studies. There is also a large experimental gap: while the authors create the necessary genetic tools, they do not investigate the neural control and natural dynamics of proboscis movement beyond artificial optogenetic stimulation. In the absence of such data, the main contribution of these papers is the clear and thorough anatomy. However, the convoluted organization of the two manuscripts require the reader to sift through disparate data to reach a clear understanding of how the proboscis motor system is organized. These manuscripts would need to be significantly reorganized and streamlined to be understood by a general neuroscience audience.

1) It is not clear to why these manuscripts are separate. The basis for separating them seems to be to avoid one behemoth paper but the division between tools and function obscures the take-home message of the work. For example, many of the descriptions of musculature in ""Comprehensive genetic tools to target motor neurons for each muscle of the fly proboscis"" (called paper 1 below) are critical for understanding the optogenetic activation of motor neurons in ""Motor neuron control of Drosophila proboscis reaching"" (called paper 2 below), resulting in an unnecessary duplication of effort between the manuscripts to understand how the proboscis is moved. Take mn9, for example: it is hard to know what to take from Figure 1, Figure 4 and Figure 9 in paper 1, if the critical proof to show that mn9 extends the proboscis is in paper 2. (Past work has shown m9 to be involved in proboscis protraction, so you could argue that a knowledgeable reader may know this, but that undercuts the purpose of Figure 2 in paper 2). There are also examples of data in primary figures that do not advance the author's case. For example, in paper 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 6 and Figure 8 are supplementary figures. Figure 2: The images of FlyLight Gen 1 Gal4 lines are unhelpful, fly researchers can find these and they are not helpful to a non-Drosophilist. Figure 3: I commend the authors for including images of the entire nervous system, not often shown, but again, these are supporting information. Figure 6 can support Figure 5. Figure 8 does suggest that MNs likely do not receive direct information from sensory neurons or other previously described interneurons, but these hypotheses are not tested further, so Figure 8 can support Figure 7.

By the same token, paper 2 would benefit from schematics of muscles and an overview of reaching related vs. pharyngeal motor neurons. This distinction is helpful, and since it is consistent with past work. Because the function of pharyngeal muscles is not explored further, it would not detract from the message of paper 2. paper 2 contains functional data that can be combined: e.g. protraction (Figure 2) and retraction (Figure 3) of the rostrum could be one figure, together with anatomical data from paper 1. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5 also contain many panels of different metrics, normalized or baseline subtracted. It is not necessary to show all these data in this form, and it detracts from the message. My suggestion would be to combine Figure 2 Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5 haustellum and rostrum images. Figure 7 is beautiful! But it should be split up to accompany the data in Figure 2 and Figure 3 and Figure 4 and Figure 5.

In addition, much of the introductions of both manuscripts are either unnecessary or misleading (see below), so combining the data into a single manuscript will also help to eliminate those problems. In summary, I do not see a clear reason to split data across papers.

2) The optogenetic activation data that the authors present do not provide insight into how reaching kinematics are produced: 2 second stimulation of motor neurons is not a naturalistic manipulation, and resulting proboscis trajectories are collapsed into sing"|2
2020-06-25|"During even the most normal school year, there are a lot of little interruptions to teaching and learning each day—a tardy student walking into class, an announcement over the loudspeaker, a call to the classroom phone.

Those interruptions can add up to the loss of between 10 and 20 days of instructional time, a new study finds. And as schools across the country prepare to welcome back students in the fall after a disrupted spring, they will need to address what is expected to be significant learning loss. Reducing external interruptions in the classroom could be one way to do that, researchers say.

""As educators and humans, we dismiss things when we can't conceptualize the sum total, when each individual instance is very small,"" said Matthew Kraft, an associate professor of education and economics at Brown University and an author of the working paper. ""Oh, an interruption takes 20 seconds—given the huge challenges our education system is facing, why would we focus on that? We, for the first time, provide a more precise accounting of the frequency of these interruptions, the nature of these interruptions, ... and the duration of these interuptions and the disruptions that they cause.""

To better understand classroom interruptions, researchers surveyed 13,800 students, 1,500 teachers, and 70 administrators in the Providence, R.I., school district. They also conducted 63 classroom observations in five high schools in the district to time and catalogue the interruptions and the disruptions that followed. These observations happened in spring 2017.

They found that the most common outside interruption—amounting to 38 percent of all observed interruptions—was students arriving late to class. A tardy student would knock on the door, causing the teacher or another student to stop what they were doing and let them in. The teacher would then have to pause instruction to get the tardy student situated, which would often distract other students from the task at hand.

The second most common kind of interruption—17 percent—was visits by other teachers, administrators, and school staff. These interruptions were not observations or evaluations, Kraft said. Instead, visitors would knock on classroom doors to borrow materials, pull a student out of class, or get a teacher's signature.

Announcements over the loudspeaker—about sporting events, field trips, and upcoming testing, or calls for specific students to come to the office—made up 14 percent of interruptions. More than half of the announcements researchers heard were not relevant for the students or teachers in the classes they observed.

Other common interruptions were calls to classroom phones, visits by students who were not members of the class, and students returning to class after going to the office or the bathroom.

See also: How Unexpected Interruptions Hurt Student Learning (Opinion)

But the interruptions were only half the problem. Researchers noted that they often led to longer disruptions: Students would get off task and start talking about non-academic topics, including about the interruptions themselves. About 15 percent of all classroom interruptions led to disruptions that intefered with learning for the rest of the class period—students would disengage with the lesson, distract each other, or have to leave class, or the teacher would not be able to finish the lesson.

On average, the observed interruptions lasted 44 seconds, and subsequent disruptions lasted another 57 seconds. Since not every interruption resulted in a disruption, the average length of time lost was 78 seconds. Across a school year, that amounts to 54.5 hours of lost instructional time, or 10 days. Even if researchers subtracted the interruptions caused by tardy students and focus on only interruptions that are under the control of school leaders, that's still 6.7 days of lost instructional time.

Since researchers only observed classes during the spring, and only in a select five schools, they asked teachers across the district to estimate how many minutes in a typical hour-long class were lost because of external interruptions. According to their responses, an average of about seven minutes are lost in each class—up to 20.7 days of lost instructional time across the school year. Researchers estimate that a typical high school classroom in the Providence school district is interrupted 2,000 times per year.

While this study was centered in one school district, past research has confirmed that classroom interruptions are common. A 2000 study that compared videos of 8th grade math instruction in the United States and Japan found that outside interruptions occurred in about 30 percent of the U.S. lessons, but never occurred once in Japanese lessons.

""These results are not characteristic of every school out there, but I do think they highlight the challenge that a lot of teachers face in ... trying to maintain students' focus and attention,"" Kraft said of his study.

And minimizing these interruptions can be ""a surprisingly feasible and low-cost way to recoup lost instructional time,"" he said, especially as schools are grappling with what will likely be a significant ""COVID-19 slide.""

He recommends that school leaders ask their teachers to record every class interruption for a week and then examine the data. One easy solution, Kraft said, would be turning off the intercom system and only making schoolwide announcements during advisory periods or homeroom. Another way would be to email or text teachers with requests instead of calling them on the classroom phone, he said.

Teachers could also put a sign on their door asking visitors to leave a note instead of knocking, or designate one student to help acclimate any tardy students, the paper says.

""Some interruptions are necessary and likely important,"" Kraft said. ""We need to do fire drills, we need to [provide students with] specialized services, we need to promote a school culture of openness and provide formative feedback. From our experience, very few of the interruptions were those types.""

And the constant interruptions are frustrating for both students and teachers, he said.

""We are implicitly saying, 'We don't value your work or your time,' when we ask teachers to work in an environment where we are constantly interrupting their practice with what are often, but not always, quite trivial interruptions,"" he said."|0
2020-06-25|"Among researchers, PhD students are perhaps suffering the most from coronavirus lockdown restrictions put in place around the world. Interruptions caused by the pandemic are producing a cohort of worried research students who are concerned about the completion and quality of their work.

One student in our department at Edge Hill University in Ormskirk, UK, is working on the conservation ecology of a rare butterfly and needs to synchronize her fieldwork with the insect’s flight period. This lasts from late June until late July, so this year’s field season will almost certainly be lost. Another student, a microbiologist, started her PhD only a few months ago, and has no laboratory access and thus no means of generating data.

At the other end of the PhD timescale, a student investigating the molecular basis of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes is facing difficult decisions on the feasibility of a planned final round of experiments. Does she wait, and continue once insect stocks are raised and labs are functioning again, or does she curtail the work and proceed with writing up, knowing that important evidence might be missing?

It is unlikely that any of these students would have a problem getting extensions to their deadlines — but extensions to funding might not be so easily available.

Coronavirus and COVID-19: Keep up to date

As student and supervisor, we soon found ourselves facing the same dilemmas. When the lockdown seemed imminent, we discussed our plans — and potential alternatives — for the next few weeks. As the situation worsened and the prospect of long-term effects became a reality, our meetings came to cover growing anxieties over the future of the project. We talked about the restrictions imposed on our plans by the pandemic and what financial support or extra time the university plans to provide to postgraduate researchers. We then realized that, to move forwards, we had to welcome change.

Right now, there is a generation of PhD students stuck at home for whom the constraints and uncertainty created by the coronavirus present a unique obstacle. We think that doctoral projects — like many other ongoing projects — should be adapted to the circumstances by encouraging creative thinking and updating academic standards. Here are five ideas for students (and supervisors) in a similar situation to ours. We acknowledge that some will not be feasible, but we consider it important that PhD students think creatively and strategically about the options open to them.

Consider a different research route for the project

Less time available in the lab or in the field might mean a new approach is required to address the research question. Think about a fresh perspective or element for the project. For instance, after discussions with her supervisors, our butterfly researcher has transformed her original plans — to manipulate the insect’s habitat to assess the impact of vegetation changes — into a meta-analysis of the relevant literature.

Update the plans for the research. Be ruthless. PhD students and their supervisors should identify analyses that they can do while working from home, important experiments to set up as soon as possible and experiments to omit if time is going to be more limited.

Consider reducing the number of chapters in the thesis.

The academic requirements for a PhD are to generate original findings and place them in the wider context of the literature. In many cases, this is possible in fewer chapters than initially planned. There might subsequently be one less paper, but university employers and funding bodies will recognize this new reality. The world of science should accept that it’s OK to do less during this unprecedented situation.

Despite the cancellation of conferences and seminars, there are still opportunities to discuss your ideas or plans with colleagues. For instance, several societies and research communities are opening up online spaces for researchers — especially early-career scientists — to provide inspiration through social media. Use these platforms to get fresh ideas for the project, and to present some results and plans, and get feedback on them.

Be upfront about the challenges with the examiners.

When the time comes for the viva, be confident in explaining the effects of the pandemic on the project in the thesis’s introduction or in the PhD defence. The external examiners will have seen the impact on their own research and will be sympathetic to the challenges you have faced. A favourite question among examiners is how the project has evolved as it progressed. The current crisis gives students a head start in answering this.

Even without the disruption and uncertainty caused by the pandemic, a PhD is rarely smooth sailing. However, a smooth sea never made a skilled sailor. For PhD students, this global crisis is an opportunity to show resilience as researchers negotiating the choppy ocean of their projects. The rest of us should remember that PhD students rely on their supervisors and research community for direction and encouragement. The pandemic is likely to take a toll on their mental health over and above the usual pressure from deadlines and the demand for publications. In these strange times, research students need our support and understanding more than ever."|1
2020-06-25|"Editor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter. For more stories and our pandemic tracker, see our hub

I a panel of experts convened by the World Health Organisation ( ) put together a list of diseases that posed big public-health risks but for which there were few or no countermeasures. It featured various well-recognised threats, including Ebola, , Zika and Rift Valley fever. But it also included “Disease X”.

This illness, caused by a pathogen never before seen in humans, would, the panel said, emerge from animals somewhere in a part of the world where people had encroached on wildlife habitats. It would be more deadly than seasonal influenza but would spread just as easily between people. By hitching rides on travel and trade networks, it would journey beyond its continent of origin within weeks of its emergence. It would cause the world’s next big pandemic, and leave economic and social devastation in its wake.

Less than two years after the report was published Disease X turned up. It began late last year in Wuhan, China, and the wider world became aware of it in January. It has now infected nearly 10m people and killed almost 500,000 of them. That death toll is also likely to reach seven figures before things are over. For Disease X now has a name: covid-19.

Though perhaps the loudest, the ’s was not the only warning that something like this might happen. Moreover, some of the prophets, such as Peter Daszak, a disease ecologist who is head of an independent research organisation called the EcoHealth Alliance, specifically focused on the risk posed by bat-borne coronaviruses, as - o -2, the cause of covid-19, has turned out to be. And the point of issuing those warnings was preparedness. With the correct systems in place a potential pandemic, spotted early, might be nipped in the bud.

Instead, the world’s response to the new illness has been similar to its response to in 2002 and, after that, to 1 avian influenza in 2005. This is to move into a costly panic mode intended to slow the spread of the disease while scientists race to develop a vaccine. “This,” as Dr Daszak, observes wryly, “is not a plan.”

To see Disease X simply as a warning about covid-19 that the world ignored is, though, to miss the point that the panel was making. Disease X was also a warning about Disease Y, and after it Disease Z. It was a warning about aspects of modern life that encourage the spread of previously unknown pathogens like - o -2. As long as these matters are not addressed, the risk will remain of further zoonotic outbreaks, in which a pathogen passes from animals to human beings, and then from human to human in the exponential way now sadly familiar.

Dr Daszak’s point is that the matters in question can and should be dealt with. Future zoonotic outbreaks are surely inevitable. But with the right precautions it should be possible to ensure that they do not, as the current one has, lead to pandemics.

The precautions Dr Daszak and his colleagues have in mind add up to a three-layered defence. The first layer is a worldwide effort to find and track the hundreds of thousands of as-yet-unseen pathogens that might threaten human health. The second is the monitoring of blood samples and other indicators from people living in places where new diseases are most likely to emerge. The third is a concerted programme that employs all the data thus collected to get a head-start in the development of drugs and vaccines that might be used to meet an emerging disease halfway.

More than 1,400 pathogens are known to infect human beings. Only a fifth of these are viruses. But viruses are the cause of more than two-thirds of new human diseases, which is why both the discussion and the effort are focused on them.

Being simple organisms that can reproduce quickly, viruses undergo much more rapid evolution than other types of pathogens. Hence their ability to adapt to novel hosts. Simian immunodeficiency virus ( ), for example, moved from monkeys to chimpanzees and, separately, to gorillas before one of the chimpanzee strains got into people and became , which went on to cause the pandemic (see article). Influenza viruses that break out into human beings are routinely found to have cycled through pigs or chickens first. And - o , as the virus which caused the outbreak in 2002 is now known, started in bats before (it is widely believed) migrating to civets.

Ecologically, human beings as a species are particularly likely to be on the receiving end of this process. Few wild animals spend as much time cooped up with members of their own and other species as do herd animals and their herders. So when people domesticated animals and began to live in large, fixed settlements they gave viruses many opportunities to jump back and forth between species, a process called viral chatter. Many common diseases date back to the early days of domestication, and the population densities it brought with it. The species involved were not all domesticated. Smallpox appears to have come from rats. But the animals involved were ones that thrived in human company.

Zoonoses have continued ever since. Of more than 330 diseases which emerged between 1940 and 2004, over 60% were zoonotic. Of those over 70% originated in wildlife. For viruses the proportions were 69% and 87% respectively (see chart). This process seems to be accelerating. As human populations grow, previously wild areas are settled. That brings people into contact with sources of infection they would not otherwise have encountered. And, having encountered them, it is also easier to pass them on. Modern transport means that if a disease gets into people living in this frontier between civilisation and the wilderness it can quickly make its way to a local metropolis and thence, courtesy of lorries, trains and planes, to others anywhere in the world. The idea that these risks deserve systematic appraisal and monitoring surfaced after the emergence, in 2005, of the strain of avian influenza. This was first detected in 1996, when it killed some geese in Guangdong province, China. The following year it infected 18 people associated with a poultry market in neighbouring Hong Kong, six of whom died. But for most of the subsequent decade the virus was restricted to farmed birds on the Chinese mainland. In 2004, however, a highly pathogenic strain emerged and began to spread across South-East Asia, killing tens of millions of birds. By the middle of 2005 this version of the virus had infected wild geese, which took it into Europe, India and Africa. That year, 98 people were infected, and 43 of them died—a death rate severe enough for David Nabarro, then co-ordinator of the ’s response to influenza, to issue a warning that an unchecked outbreak could kill up to 150m people. In 1968 a less pathogenic strain of flu, which had originated in the same area, killed 1m people when it spread around the world. In 1957 a still-earlier relative killed 1.1m. was considerably more lethal than either.

In the end, forms of that could spread easily from person to person never arose. But they came close. In 2012 Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ron Fouchier of Erasmus University in Rotterdam undertook to discover how many mutations would have been required to make transmissible between people via the droplets expelled in a sneeze. They found that changes at just five points in the genome would have done the trick. Two of these mutations were later shown to exist already in wild populations of the virus.

Fortunately, the other three never happened. The disease was brought under control among farmed birds, though it still circulates at a low level in wild populations, and human fatalities remained in the tens, rather than the tens of millions. This near miss may have spurred complacency among laymen. Scientists’ dire warnings had come to naught. Among virologists and epidemiologists, though, it was a call to action—and one which came at an opportune time. The cost of sequencing the and in which viruses store their genes was, in the second half of the 2000s, falling at extraordinary speed (see Graphic detail). That made virus hunting possible on a previously unimaginable scale.

In 2009 Dennis Carroll, an infectious-disease expert at , America’s international development agency, who had led that agency’s response to the outbreak, set up . This project investigated and catalogued potential disease threats to people living near wildlife, with a particular focus on viruses. A few years later Jeremy Farrar, an infectious-disease doctor who was then at Oxford University’s clinical research unit in Ho Chi Minh City and now heads the Wellcome Trust, a large medical-research charity, created Vizions. This project tracked pathogens circulating in people and animals living close together in farms and markets across Vietnam.

ran for just over a decade. Scientists working with local teams in 30 countries collected around 170,000 samples from people and wild animals, mainly non-human primates, bats and rodents. In the process they discovered 1,200 new viruses belonging to families known to have the potential to infect people and cause epidemics. Among these were more than 160 potentially zoonotic coronaviruses.

This, though, just scratched the surface. On the basis of how much they found during their early work Dr Carroll and his colleagues made a statistical estimate that, all told, the world’s mammals and birds play host to between 700,000 and 2.6m as yet unknown species from families of viruses that have shown the potential to cause zoonotic disease in humans. Between 350,000 and 1.3m of these unknown viruses, they argued, could have zoonotic potential.

In 2018 Dr Carroll, Dr Daszak and Jonna Mazet, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Davis, put forward a proposal aimed at turning those statistical estimates into genetic seque"|2

Written inside were the names of Botswanans who had tested positive for . The stigma of having the virus that causes meant there had to be the “deepest secrecy”, she recalls.

Soon a single notebook was not enough. By the end of the 1990s more than a quarter of Botswanans aged 15-49 had the virus, the highest rate in the world. Between 1986 and 2001 life expectancy fell by more than a decade, from 61 to 50 years—lower than when the country became independent in 1966.

The / pandemic was the formative experience for many of the doctors leading the response to covid-19. Dr Moeti is director of the World Health Organisation’s Africa region. Anthony Fauci, who advises President Donald Trump, earned his spurs during America’s crisis. “I draw on for just about everything we do,” says Salim Abdool Karim, who advises President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa.

The two great pandemics of the past 50 years are very different. is usually spread via sex, can take years to cause disease and if untreated is highly lethal. In Cameroon it was called le poison lent, the slow poison. - o -2, the virus that causes covid-19, is less deadly, but spreads and manifests much more quickly. Nevertheless / is a constant reference point. When Dr Moeti reads the latest covid-19 case numbers, she thinks of those notebooks.

An understanding of / matters for another reason. It is a reminder that pandemics do not readily disappear. Life-prolonging treatments have turned / into a mostly chronic disease. New infections have decreased for 25 years. Yet 1.7m people were newly infected in 2018. Globally 32m people have died from . Despite biomedical advances there is no cure and no vaccine. Human behaviour and norms had to change. Tens of millions deal with the vast indirect impacts, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The worst of the pandemic may be over, but its effects endure.

The history of in humans began around a century ago. Scientists think that the virus responsible for the vast majority of cases, -1, crossed the species barrier from chimpanzees in the 1920s or earlier in central Africa. It spread slowly for decades, before transmission accelerated worldwide in the 1970s.

In 1981 the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention ( ), an American public-health body, warned about outbreaks of pneumonia and a skin cancer, Kaposi’s sarcoma, in gay men, as well as a number of “opportunistic infections” taking advantage of a breakdown in the body’s immune system. When other cases were soon reported among Haitian migrants, haemophiliacs and heroin users, as well as babies of infected women, what had been Gay-related immunodeficiency disease ( ) became Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( ). Diagnoses followed in other parts of the world. In 1983 was discovered as the cause.

The early years of the pandemic were characterised by confusion and fear. Once symptoms emerged people typically died within 12 months. By the end of the 1980s it was one of the leading causes of death for young men in many rich countries. Andrew Sullivan, a gay journalist who is positive, recalls “witnessing the sickness and death of others, knowing that you too could be next, even as you feel fine.” In “How to Survive a Plague”, the American author David France recounts trips to the doctor at the merest hint of a skin blemish.

Some revelled in the terror. Most people catch through heterosexual sex, but in many rich countries the majority of cases were among gay men. “The poor homosexuals—they have declared war upon nature, and now nature is exacting an awful retribution,” said Pat Buchanan, an adviser to Ronald Reagan, who was elected president of the United States in 1980. Venom was coupled with hysteria. Just one undertaker in New York City would embalm victims.

It did not help that the Reagan administration was neglectful. The federal government shortchanged and slowed efforts to prevent, treat and research / . The president did not mention the disease in public until 1985. Similarly Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister of Britain, was squeamish about safe-sex campaigns and had to be overruled by Norman Fowler, her health secretary, who launched the “Don’t Die of Ignorance” campaign in 1986.

Today it’s me, tomorrow someone else

Ultimately it was people with who did much to turn the tide of the disease. Safe-sex campaigners popularised the use of condoms, while activists pressed the Food and Drug Administration, which approves medicines, to accelerate clinical trials. In America Dr Fauci, then as now the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, went from being a target of activists to becoming an ally. Larry Kramer, the irascible founding father of activism, who died aged 84 on May 27th, considered Dr Fauci “the only true and great hero” in officialdom (Kramer originally thought he was “an incompetent idiot”).

The first evidence that combination antiretroviral therapy ( ), a cocktail of -suppressing drugs, could radically change the course of the disease arrived in 1996. led to dramatic reductions in mortality rates. Patients spoke of a “Lazarus effect”. It was a turning point in rich countries. Histories of the American epidemic often end here—with a coda on how the / epidemic helped human rights and probably accelerated public acceptance of same-sex marriage.

But in developing countries the situation remained grim. Most -positive people have always lived in Africa, where the virus is overwhelmingly spread via heterosexual sex. By 1996 was the most common cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa. In Zimbabwe life expectancy fell to 43 in 2003.

There is no single reason for the severity of the pandemic in Africa. There are biological reasons to consider, from the amplifying role of tuberculosis, high rates of other sexually transmitted diseases, the potential role of African genomes, and the viral subtypes common in Africa. Then there is the swish of Occam’s razor by John Iliffe in “The African Epidemic”, in which he writes that: “Africa had the worst epidemic because it had the first epidemic.”

Multiple theories have been put forward, most containing some truth. Poverty, for example, matters. When cost at least $10,000 per person per year, as it did in 1996, only elites could be treated. But poverty does not explain why prevalence was already so high. More than a fifth of adult residents of capitals such as Kampala and Lusaka were -positive by 1990. Other poor parts of the world, including central America, South Asia and the Caribbean were less affected. Botswana and South Africa, two of the richest African countries, are two of the hardest hit.

It is impossible to understand AIDS in Africa without a grasp of sexual inequality

Sex is wrapped up with power dynamics. It is impossible to understand in Africa without a grasp of sexual inequality. A survey of rural women who migrated to Kinshasa, Congo’s capital, revealed that many contracted after entering into transactional sexual relationships, often with older, richer men. To this day, across the region, the rates of infection among young women are far higher than among young men. In some cases women either do not feel a need to insist on condom use or are not able to insist.

Another amplifying factor was the responses of African leaders. Some, such as Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni, talked openly about the disease (even if he was sceptical about condoms). Others saw / as a Western plot or denied that it existed because Africa did not have homosexuals.

Worst was Thabo Mbeki, who succeeded Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa in 1999. While surfing the internet, he encountered the ideas of denialists, or “dissidents”, who claimed that the virus was not the cause of the disease. He prevented poor South Africans from getting state-funded s, while backing a scheme to develop a local alternative that turned out to be an industrial solvent. Activists and judges eventually brought about a more rational set of policies. But not before 340,000 needless deaths, estimates Nicoli Nattrass, an economist.

Religion also played a role; sometimes for good, but often for ill. Data from Afrobarometer, a pollster, suggest that religious figures are more respected than other pillars of society. As in America, many saw / as punishment for sin, with some churches opposing condoms and refusing to bury victims. Traditional religions could be unhelpful, too. In Malawi hundreds of thousands flocked to one healer who claimed ancestral spirits had instructed him in the use of a tree bark to cleanse people of the disease.

Blame, stigma and denial discouraged open conversations about / . In Congo, , the French initials for , was said to stand for syndrome imaginaire pour décourager les amoureux, or “imaginary syndrome to discourage lovers”. Though some famous Africans, such as Philly Lutaaya, a Ugandan singer, were honest about their condition; others, like Fela Kuti, a Nigerian musician, were not.

The fear of what an diagnosis might mean for your family, or your position within it, was pervasive. Some traditional religions saw early deaths as a break in the ancestral chain. And if you were the first in your family to test positive, you could be accused of bringing the disease into a household. Since women were more likely to get tested, and because of the possibility of transmitting the virus to a fetus, they were at greater risk of stigmatisation. It is perhaps unsurprising then that, despite widespread knowledge of / by the 1990s, only a minority of positive Africans got tested. And why bother with a test when there was no affordable treatment? was often only one issue among many. Data from Afrobarometer suggest that / has never been a major election issue anywhere, bar Botswana. The result was that / enfeebled workers.

2020-06-25|"A slew of dour headlines prompted a shift in risk sentiment on Wednesday, driving equities lower and dragging commodity and growth led currencies downward. The Australian dollar slipped back below 0.69 US cents amid increasing market nervousness, as a surge in COVID 19 cases prompts calls for renewed social distancing measures, while US and EU trade tensions and a correction in the IMF economic outlook added further weight to the risk off move, forcing the AUD toward intraday lows at 0.6865.

The Australian dollar, having failed in its bid to push above 0.70 US cents now appears somewhat range bound, bouncing between 0.6830 and 0.6960, with more broader supports in play on moves approaching 0.6780 and 0.67. Demand for risk continues to be the primary force governing direction and as markets grapple with an ever-shifting risk on risk off mood, volatility within recent ranges has increased. Investors have become increasingly sensitive to headline news as the risk on move that sustained the AUD upturn through April and May runs out of steam and markets are not yet willing to shift focus to underlying fundamental indicators. With Covid19 infection rates soaring around the world hopes of a prompt rebound in economic activity are beginning to wane capping AUD upside through the short term and opening the door to a longer period of consolidation and increasing downward pressure.

Attentions today turn again to US unemployment claims as the headline item on the macroeconomic docket, while Coronavirus headlines and trade tensions direct risk sentiment.

The US dollar was the big winner Wednesday, as risk sentiment soured and investors sought safety in haven assets. An alarming rise in coronavirus infection rates around the world, with the US recording its second largest increase in new infections since the pandemic began prompted calls for a return to strict social distancing controls. Investors appear to be finally coming to grips with the fact that the second wave of infections will likely derail the economic rebound as a longer path to recovery lies ahead. A fact evidenced by the IMF most recent review of economic activity. The IMF now expects global output will shrink almost 5%, up from its 3% estimate in April, as advanced economies like the US suffer unprecedented declines in GDP output.

The Euro Fell through 1.13 and 1.1250, touching intraday lows at 1.1245 after the office of US trade published a note, announcing new tariffs will be imposed on over $3 billion of European imports, with some tariffs as high as 100%. The note comes as the World Trade Organization rules on EU issued tariff on US goods and serves as a reminder of US-EU trade tensions.

The Canadian dollar fell sharply as oil prices plunged amid concerns increasing coronavirus infections will force renewed lockdown measures and re-ignite supply issues that plagued oil markets in April.

Attentions today remain affixed to risk demand as investor sentiment is perhaps finally shifting back toward a more conservative playbook.

2020-06-26|"The Australian dollar crept marginally higher through choppy trade on Thursday as investor attentions remain squarely affixed to the largely unchecked spread of COVID-19 throughout the US, Latin America and South Africa. Having touched intraday lows at 0.6851 the AUD edged upward to mark session highs at 0.6890, but struggled to break outside the 40 point range despite a number of short run upward rallies. Markets appeared reluctant to extend gains across commodity currencies and risk assets, leaving equities, the AUD, NZD and CAD mostly flat on the day.

The re-emergence and rapid spread of new Coronavirus cases across the US has spooked investors, dampening expectations for a swift rebound in economic activity. With the US recovery interrupted, investors are coming to terms with the realities of the current environment and a long/protracted rebuild. The risk on/risk off battle of the past fortnight is starting to tip toward a broader risk-off move with haven assets finding increased support. Equities lost 1.5% through early trade before regulatory change in the US meant a freeing of capital for US banks, prompting a jump in financial stocks that propped up the S&P 500.

As sentiment plays an increasingly important roll in short-term direction our focus remains with broader equity performance as a marker of investors’ appetite for risk. A deeper risk-off move will likely put pressure on short-term supports at 0.6830/40 and could see the AUD retreat back toward 0.67 and possibly 0.66.

The US dollar crept higher through trade on Thursday when measured against a basket of major counterparts, up two tenths of a percent and closing in on four week highs as concerns surrounding a coronavirus resurgence pushes investors toward haven assets. The rapid spread of new infections across a swathe of US states, with Texas and North Carolina forced to suspend plans to re-open their economies and instead impose new measures to try and control their respective outbreaks, has prompted investors to begin re-assessing expectations for a prompt rebound in economic activity. Even if other State and Federal officials continue with the wider economic opening, activity through the short-term is likely to be muted and the recovery process slowed. This fact is beginning to weigh on investors and we are seeing the beginnings of a shift in broader sentiment. A sustained risk-off shift will likely see the USD find renewed short-term demand as markets unwind risk plays.

The GBP is lower this morning after the UK’s Chief Brexit negotiator refused to agree to a compromise on tariffs. While the focus remains largely with the battle against the coronavirus, there is still a long way to go before the UK leaves the EU at the end of the year and further delays/setbacks in divorce negotiations are adding further downward pressure on the GBP. Having slipped below 1.24, the GBP appears well supported on moves approaching 1.2350 for now, but a sell off in risk could prompt a move back toward 1.22 and 1.20.

2020-06-26|"Lunchtime in Eyre Square: sunshine and shadows, a small gang of skateboarders doing tricks, a busker singing Black is the Colour and, for June, a marked absence of tourists. It is a time like no other and that extends to Irish politics.

Peter Allen, Pat O’Grady and Frank Greally stand under the shade of a tree and discuss what is a singular moment for their party, Fine Gael. They’ve seen each other plenty on Zoom meetings with other party members in their Galway West constituency, with long talks about the programme for government and what the proposed coalition would mean for their party.

“I think we can deal with it either way,” says Allen.

“If we end up in government, I think fine. We would prefer to be in opposition after so many years in government. And if you were to look at this in a cold way of what is best for the party, you might decide we should walk away. But I do think this is the worst challenge we will face. It is not a time for people with theories and knowledge. You need practitioners. And Fine Gael has those.”

All three men come from families with Fine Gael affinities but say that the principles and conduct of Garret FitzGerald were what drew them to becoming actively involved.

For Greally, Declan Costello was another key influence. They are not afraid of the implication that five years of government could render them indistinguishable from Fianna Fáil. But that fear of loss of identity has left some local party members strongly against the alliance.

“Their main fear is that the identity of the party will disappear,” says Allen. “If it lasts five years, will we be decimated in the polls? But you have five years to make a mark. Most that were vehemently against it at the start have listened and moved to ‘I mightn’t like it but we have to do it.’”

Do they, though?

The Government’s performance during the Covid-19 pandemic has led to a Fine Gael resurgence in opinion polls. What if they just went to the electorate again now, with the economy reopening and the sun shining?

“I don’t think we’d be thanked,” says Allen.

“Fine Gael will try to form a government,” says O’Grady. “But not at any price. We have our own views. It used to be called the Christian Democratic side of Fine Gael in the times of Sweetman and Costello. We will go so far but we won’t sell ourselves completely.”

The decision may not be theirs anyway.

“If the Greens vote against this, then I think we will be out of it,” Allen adds.

They are proud of Fine Gael’s record since coming into power in 2011 when the country was buckled by the economic recession and the response to the pandemic. That experience is why they feel their party needs to remain in government.

“But it is time to be radical,” says Greally.

“And Fine Gael have been radical in the past with rural electrification, the land commission. And where we will need radical thinking now is achieving the green emission targets for agriculture, which is one-third of our emissions.

“The average age of farmers in Ireland is over 60. We need young people and we need to copy the land commission and bring in young ambitious people who would expand the horticultural side. The current generation have been extremely good farmers but we all get a bit more conservative as we get older. Imposing targets on them is not going to work.”

There are some positive aspects for the local economy written into the programme – the transport plan for the city, hospital advancements and Greally is optimistic that Galway city and county council can move on greenway plans.

“There is €360 million there for cycle ways but it is first come, first served and it is up to them to take advantage. But other than the green deal and tax, I don’t see where the priority is. There is no real understanding of the total imbalance between the regions in Ireland. The west-northwest has gone from developed to transition, and it could go from there to poor if nothing happens.”

Someone came up to Allen recently and told him that the Greens were “just Fine Gael with bicycles”. It made him laugh but he would argue that the party’s old, small-farming loyalty remains. But there is an acknowledgement that Irish voting patterns are more fluid and unreadable than before.

“So we have to evolve,” O’Grady says.

“And we are evolving. Fine Gael know their identity better than most parties. There will be closer links between the two big parties regardless of the outcome of the current vote. It may happen that some of Fianna Fáil will move towards Fine Gael and the more Republican element move closer to Sinn Féin. What you call that, I don’t know. But you are looking at the start of a realignment in Irish politics.”"|2
2020-06-26|"The second round of French municipal elections on Sunday is likely to be a humiliation for President Emmanuel Macron, whose party La République en Marche is unlikely to win a single town with a population of more than 10,000.

Paris was always going to be first prize in the municipal poll, and Macron once had hopes of wresting it from the Socialists who have ruled the capital for the past two decades. But the Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo, who is openly hostile to Macron, is virtually certain to be re-elected, after a disastrous campaign by LREM.

Benjamin Griveaux, the president’s first choice for mayor of Paris, had to withdraw from the race last winter due to a sexting scandal. He was replaced by the former health minister Agnès Buzyn. She was placed a distant third in the first round last March, then criticised the way the government she participated in handled the Covid-19 epidemic.

Macron was unable to persuade the mathematician and renegade LREM deputy Cédric Villani to end his independent candidacy, which siphoned votes from the official LREM candidates.

The Paris campaign laid bare Macron’s greatest weaknesses, his failure to create a local base for LREM, and what might be called a human resources problem, due to the lack of seasoned politicians in his young party.

The Élysée gives the impression it is eager to put the embarrassing municipal poll behind it. A presidential adviser focused on “the new stage” of Macron’s presidency at a briefing on Thursday. In the last two years of his term, Macron intends to concentrate on rebuilding the economy and redistributing power between the central government, regions and departments, to the benefit of the latter.

Macron is intent on showing that he is moving on. Rather than dwell on Sunday night’s results, he will start Monday by receiving the 150 members of the Citizens’ Convention on Climate, then travel to Meseberg, Germany, to discuss European issues with Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Macron on Thursday launched a “national independent mission on the management of the Covid-19 crisis and the risk of future pandemics”. The president chose Prof Didier Pittet of the University of Geneva to head the mission, which will run parallel to a parliamentary inquiry.

A close adviser to Macron said the very fact that local elections can be held three months after they were postponed because of the pandemic signals “a victory of reopening and the regression of the virus”. Macron hopes a high turnout will “confirm the confidence of the French in the authorities”.

Macron “does not expect any national lessons from the vote”, the adviser said. Previous local elections were held in 2014, two years before LREM was founded. LREM candidates will join the cohort of 35,000 French mayors for the first time.

“So the president will observe LREM successes here and there,” the adviser continued. “But he is president of all French people, and under the institutions he is above political parties.”

For a population of 172,000, results in the Channel port town of Le Havre are disproportionately important. Prime minister Édouard Philippe is standing for his old job as mayor and has made it clear he will withdraw to Le Havre if Macron sacks him in the cabinet reshuffle, which is slated for after the municipal poll.

Philippe has served Macron loyally and with competency. But he has refused to join LREM and is more than 10 percentage points ahead of Macron in opinion polls.

Marseille and Lyon, the second and third cities of France, are also typical of the reconfiguration of French politics.

The conservatives may lose Marseille, which they have ruled for the past quarter century. A candidate from the environmentalist party EELV surpassed the incumbent mayor from the conservative party Les Républicains by one percentage point in the first round.

EELV placed first in the first round in Lyon too, where the outgoing mayor, Gérard Collomb, has dominated politics for 20 years. Collomb, a former Socialist, was an early, prominent supporter of Macron. The president rewarded Collomb with the interior ministry, but the two men fell out and Collomb resigned. He has now allied himself with his former conservative adversaries in the hope of defeating the environmentalists.

LR took 140 cities of more than 10,000 people in 2014, because voters wanted to punish then president François Hollande. Conservatives are likely to lose cities on Sunday.

EELV may replicate its breakthrough in the 2019 European elections, when it won 13.47 per cent of the vote."|1

More On MLS In The Morning

If you’ve gotten this far, you’ve noticed that yes, the tournament will include seven games that kick off at 9 am ET.

And they are all on weekdays, eliminating comparisons to the Breakfast at Wimbledon telecasts tennis fans know well. There’s a pretty simple reason why: weekend morning games would conflict directly with telecasts from popular leagues in Europe that continue to play their matches through the summer.

Further, all the games will be on ESPN, which is a coup for the league to have ESPN’s popular ‘Get Up’ morning show as lead-in programming. If MLS can’t grow its modest but stable in broadcast ratings in that environment, it just might not be possible.

Another small but noteworthy detail is that the league did not unilaterally “punish” East Coast teams by assigning them all the morning matches. No teams play more than one early game. Of the 14 involved in them, eight are from the Eastern Time Zone, four from the Central, and one each from the Mountain (Real Salt Lake) and the Pacific (Seattle Sounders).

Maybe the most welcome twist of the tournament is that the conference structure does not appear to factor into the knockout stages. Teams from the East and West can meet in a round of 16 and presumably in additional rounds prior to the final.

For a tournament expected to more or less replace the 2020 U.S. Open Cup on the calendar this year, it’s refreshing to see it address the often-criticized regionalization of the nation’s. In Cup Competitions in other nations, part of the allure is a random draw format that makes it possible for two giants to meet in the early rounds, or two local rivals to be separated until the final. That never happens in the U.S. Open Cup. But in the MLS is Back Tournament, it appears that at least the latter is possible."|2
2020-06-26|"The result of the Green Party vote on the programme for government could be “on a knife edge,” party sources have said.

Some 2,000 members of the party are expected to participate in the internal ballot with a two-thirds majority required if the party is to enter coalition.

A number of internal sources have said that because of opposition to the plan in Northern Ireland as well as opposition among the youth wing of the party, support levels of up to 80 per cent may be needed at a constituency level.

Of those registered to vote for the Greens, some 195 are in Northern Ireland.

Counting of the votes will begin on Friday morning and a result is expected at about 6pm.

“If the numbers are close, if we just about get the required backing, there may be calls for a recount. This would take us closer to 9pm realistically,” a party source said, adding that soundings from constituencies indicated the result may be tighter than expected.

The Greens initially allowed telephone voting only for members outside the the Republic and Northern Ireland, but this week widened the eligibility to allow anyone who has not received their ballot paper to vote over the phone.

Minister of State for Disabilities and Independent TD Finian McGrath said on Thursday evening that the Green Party will have to learn how to compromise over the term of the next government if the deal passes.

“I think they have to learn that when you go into government, if you are an Independent or someone like the Green Party, you have to learn the c-word. You have to learn to compromise.

“You are going to achieve certain objectives, you are not going to get everything you want. But you will achieve certain things and I would strongly recommend that they go into government because it is a very important place to be and in particular for the debate on climate change and the whole reorganisation of society.

“I think the Greens should go into government. At this late hour I would encourage them to go in because it is in the national interest, we have a Covid crisis, your country needs you. I think they should step up and do it.”

“Too many TDs are sitting on the fence and are not prepared to go into government,” Mr McGrath said.

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar also said last night that he believes the vote will pass with a higher level of support than people expect.

It is expected that both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil will attempt to co-ordinate the announcement of their party ballots to the Green’s announcement on Friday."|0
2020-06-26|"TEMPE – Arizonans will face a 14-day quarantine if they travel to New York, New Jersey or Connecticut, whose governors announced the restriction Wednesday to keep people from COVID-19 “hot spots” from bringing the infection with them.

The quarantine, which took effect at midnight Wednesday, applied to nine states with positive virus test rates above 10% or 10 cases per 100,000 residents over a seven-day period. Arizona has been well beyond that threshold for the past three weeks, as the state has regularly set new records for daily infections.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont jointly announced the quarantine Wednesday on travelers from Arizona, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, Utah and Texas.

Cuomo said the three Northeast states, which were hit hard by COVID-19 early in the pandemic, “worked very hard to get the viral transmission rate down” and they want to keep it that way.

“We don’t want to see it go up because a lot of people come into this region and they could literally bring the infection with them,” Cuomo said. “It wouldn’t be malicious or malevolent, but it would still be real.”

Murphy said imposing the quarantine is just “a smart thing to do” to protect their states.

“We have taken our people, the three of us, these three states, through hell and back. The last thing we need to do right now is subject our folks to another round,” he said.

It’s a reversal from April, when infection rates in the Northeast were running high and Arizona imposed travel restrictions on travelers from those states. Aldo Vazquez, spokesperson for AAA Arizona, said “obviously, it’s the 180 now.”

“Back in April, New York, the Northeast was a hot spot and Arizona applied a restriction from travelers in that area,” Vazquez said. “And now we’ve become the hot spot. And we’re seeing the reverse relationship going on here.”

The announcement comes as Arizona has seen cases of COVID-19 skyrocket in recent weeks. There have been 19,048 new cases in the past week, almost a third of the 59,974 cases since the first COVID-19 positive test in the state in late January.

Over the past three weeks, the average number of new cases per day has risen from 993 to 1,257 to 2,385 for the week ended Sunday, a rate of about 32 cases per 100,000 residents. Arizona also posted a new record Wednesday for deaths in a day, with 79 COVID-19 deaths reported.

Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has faced criticism for his decision to relax a stay-home order in May and his refusal to impose a statewide requirement that people wear masks in public. Against the backdrop of soaring cases, however, Ducey last week announced that local governments would be allowed to impose their own mask mandates.

“We have successfully slowed the spread of COVID-19 in the past. We’re going to successfully slow COVID-19 again,” he said then.

Ducey’s office did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday on the quarantine order. But Cuomo cited Arizona as one of the states where he said opening the economy put “people’s lives in jeopardy.”

“And you look at Arizona, you look at Texas, you look at all these states, you know what you see? You see an arrow going up, because it was misguided to say we’re going to reopen the economy,” Cuomo said. “What you’re doing is you’re putting people’s lives in jeopardy, and you’re hurting the economy.”

Vijal Ludlow, co-owner of Awaken Travels, said travelers who are caught in the middle will have to weigh their options.

“I would like to tell travelers if they’re going for leisure purposes to probably wait a little bit longer until we flatten the curve a bit,” Ludlow said. “If it’s an emergency, then we just have to comply with what the state’s requirements are.”

Vazquez said AAA is encouraging people to “check the local and state restrictions, guidelines, anything that may have a destination that you are going to, to make sure that you understand what you’re heading into.”

Those include general health and safety recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department – and may include just canceling your trip, he said.

“The best thing that we can do is follow the guidelines … and right now those guidelines are just, hold off on any non-essential travel, continue practicing social distancing with face masks, and staying home as much as you possibly can,” Vazquez said."|1
2020-06-25|"Not only have I been reading about the household cleanouts many did during the pandemic break, but I’ve just seen the impact that had on one of our leading recycling agencies, Hospice Taranaki.

Since lockdown eased, hundreds have descended on hospice locations, especially the big warehouse in Westown, where staff are allowing in only one vehicle a time to prevent being overrun.

The count was 70 cars so far that day when I arrived on Monday afternoon. The main unpacking area was stacked with household items, happily being sorted by a bunch of New Plymouth's Pakeke Lions Club volunteers, whose banter is as sharp as their eyes for resaleable items.

 * Opshops calling for customers ahead of reopening



This cleverly organised trade is vital for hospices around the country. So tight-arsed have recent governments been about funding this crucial social service, they'd all go broke without income from their shops.

Governments once paid nearly three-quarters of hospice costs, but that proportion has dropped to around half. Either politicians think they're immortal or they just don't see political payoff from being less than miserly.

Hospice people don’t complain about any of that, though; they just get on with it.

And they’re good at managing what has grown into a major semi-commercial operation, with strict standards on what will be accepted into their second-hand shops. Forget about dumping rubbish on them.

Those elements can be managed, but there’s an essential one that comes from outside – volunteers.

While the lockdown in its later stages enabled permanent staff to reorganise the stock, it may also be responsible for a sudden shortage of helpers. I have a suspicion retired people – the subject of much concern during COVID – are still wary about re-emerging to continue their good works.

That will surely pass, despite the inevitable second curve of infections. As it does, social agencies are needing you more than ever, Hospice Taranaki perhaps more than most.

You’re valued for the capabilities your lifetimes have engendered, like culling unsafe electrical appliances, discerning treasure hidden in bric-à-brac, physical strength for lifting furniture and fridges, customer skills, and a plain old willingness to get stuck in and help sort the mountain into valuable components, things that can be sold in the shops and online.

An unspoken benefit (because it seems selfish) may come from donating your time and expertise. None of us can be confident the day won't arrive when we need the tender care provided by Hospice Taranaki's wonderful medical and nursing staff.

I know what they do. I wrote a book about it a few years ago, its soul partly sparked by the way they took care of my Mum in her last days.

That was two decades ago. Rob and I have never forgotten. Dad donated a wooden coat stand for the foyer, made by the incomparable Wally Briggs. It’s still there.

If this all looks uncharacteristically sentimental, then so-be-it. But there's an underlying issue here, one that casts a wide shadow.

Boomers like me have been under attack for being what some call the ""selfish generation"", one that never fought a world war, got free education to a high level, squandered the planet's resources and accelerated climate change.

That overlooks the fact that we have hard-gained wisdom and wherewithal to give back, and many of us will eschew traditional retirement to stay active and busy…and help out.

Victoria University's Nicholas Agar, a professor of philosophy, has spotted a big flaw in boomer-critics' reasoning.

His post-pandemic analysis notes the main message to older people has been to stay home so the rest of society can get busy fixing the economy. But he says the way our economy is structured, it’s too easy to overlook the contributions of the aged.

""If we can identify these contributions we’ll be less likely to respond to the next crisis by telling them to get out of the way.""

The generosity of older volunteers is mostly unknown except to family, friends and the organisations they help, until they either get a gong, an obituary in the paper, or pass on quietly in the manner that typified their lives.

They include people like those who delivered Covid rescue parcels to the less fortunate, and meals-on-wheels troopers who ignored risks to ensure food got through to the many who need it.

A host of Taranaki's voluntary organisations is endangered these days as their governing bodies centralise to Wellington. Let's help keep them local and supported. Like hospice."|1

2020-06-25|"A Fox News host got more than she could handle when she had Greater New York Black Lives matter president Hank Newsome on her show.

Martha McCallum, host of the Fox news show The Story had Newsome on as a guest on Wednesday.

READ MORE: Black Lives Matter protests have not caused increase in COVID-19 cases: research

While Fox is often derided for their biased programming, they do have guests on to presumably present a differing viewpoint or to further explain their position on issues of politics and race. Newsome would appear to be in that category as he was asked to explain the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement.

McCallum started off by asking if the organization promoted violence.

“You … have said that violence is sometimes necessary in these situations. What exactly is it that you hope to achieve through violence?”

“Wow, it’s interesting that you would pose that question like that,” Newsome said. “Because this country is built upon violence. What was the American Revolution, what’s our diplomacy across the globe?

“We go in and we blow up countries and we replace their leaders with leaders who we like. So for any American to accuse us of being violent is extremely hypocritical.”

That was just the opening salvo. McCallum was seemingly taken aback when Newsome respectfully asked to be allowed to complete his explanation when McCallum raised her voice and interrupted him.

Newsome, who wore a ‘Soul Not for Sale’ hat on the show, continued to explain that the Black Lives Matter movement was based on “saving lives, and protecting lives and there’s nothing more American than that.”

He clarified his stance on violence saying, “If this country doesn’t give us what we want, then we will burn down this system and replace it. All right? And I could be speaking … figuratively. I could be speaking literally. It’s a matter of interpretation.”

McCallum was again nonplussed when she was asked about her support for the Second Amendment which gives Americans the right to bear arms. She evaded the question saying it was “not her place here” but did allow that it was a part of the U.S. constitution.

Newsome said while he didn’t condone nor condemn rioting, he did believe it was effective, citing the eight police officers who have been fired since the protests began after the death of George Floyd on Memorial Day.

“Nobody’s talking about ambushing police officers,” Newsome said. “We’re talking about protecting lives. There’s nothing more American than that. We talk about uplifting and upholding the Second Amendment but it seems to be the hypocrisy of America that when Black people start talking about arming themselves and defending themselves, [that] talk is ‘violent’. But when white people grab assault rifles and go to our nation’s, their state capitals, it’s all good.”

McCallum then used a Martin Luther King Jr. quote during his appearance at the Southern Christian Leadership Conference convention in 1967. He made the point that love overcomes all.

“Let us be dissatisfied that day when nobody will shout, ‘White power!’, when nobody will shout, ‘Black power!’, but everybody will talk about God’s power and human power.'”

Newsome’s response to that seemed to fluster the host.

“I love the Lord and my Lord and savior,” Newsome said. “Jesus Christ is the most famous Black radical revolutionary in history. And he was treated just like Dr. King. He was arrested on occasion and he was also crucified or assassinated. This is what happens to black activists. We are killed by the government.”

McCallum, in response to Newsome’s direct question about Jesus’ ethnicity, allowed that as a man from the Middle East, he would have been Middle Eastern, but stopped short of agreeing that he was Black.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available on the Interpace website at www.interpace.com.

During this call, the company will make forward-looking statements. We caution you that any statement that is not a statement of historical fact is a forward-looking statement. This includes remarks about the company's financial projections, expectations, plans, beliefs and prospects. These statements are based on judgment and analysis as of the date of the conference call, and are subject to numerous important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

These risks and uncertainties associated with the forward-looking statements made in the conference call are described in the Safe Harbor statement in today's earnings release, as well as Interpace Biosciences's public periodic filings, including the discussion in the Risk Factor section in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 22, 2020, which includes discussions in the section on forward-looking statements. Investors or potential investors should carefully read and consider these risks. Interpace Biosciences assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or actual outcomes and does not intend to do so.

In addition, the supplement the generally accepted accounting principle or GAAP numbers, we have provided non-GAAP information. We believe that this non-GAAP information provides a meaningful supplemental information and maybe helpful in assessing the company's performance. A table reconciling the GAAP information to non-GAAP information is included in the company's earnings release, which will be available on it’s website.

I'd now like to turn the call over to the President and CEO of Interpace Biosciences, Jack Stover.

Thank you, Diego, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. Fred and I will focus on our first quarter financial progress and provide a general business update. Following that, we will open the call for questions. First quarter revenue was $9.2 million and near the top end of our previously announced revenue range. During the first quarter, we continued to grow our clinical and pharma services businesses. However, our clinical services business was impacted by the pandemic beginning in the second half of March. We also took immediate action to protect our employees from exposure, reduced discretionary and nonessential costs and accelerated operations integration.

Despite seeing improvements through mid-June, we do anticipate the impact of the coronavirus will continue through the remainder of 2020 and perhaps beyond. Our focus for the rest of the year will be continuing to respond to changing conditions, while positioning ourselves for growth and expansion, improving business processes and integrating our service offerings. As mentioned in our earnings release, we are preparing to launch our serology antibody ELISA testing for COVID-19 at our CLIA lab in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We have acquired acceptable kits and reference samples, validation is complete and we are now offering this testing to our employees and customers. Remember the importance of serology testing is to determine who is developing antibodies to the virus, and we believe that this is an important component of the process of reopening workplaces.

Now, I would like to hand the call off to Fred Knechtel, our CFO, to discuss in more detail our financial highlights for the quarter. Fred?

Thank you, Jack and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to focus on key elements of our financial performance and position. As previously mentioned, our first quarter 2020 net revenue was $9.2 million, up 53% from the $6 million in the first quarter of 2019. Clinical services first quarter 2020 net revenue was approximately 60% of total revenue and pharma services was approximately 40%.

In the first quarter of 2019, 100% of our revenue was due to our legacy clinical services, since we did not acquire the BioPharma business of Cancer Genetics until early in the third quarter of 2019. The business was impacted by lower than expected clinical service volume beginning in mid-March, which we believe resulted from the reduction in nonessential testing procedures in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, clinical services gross margin average is in excess of 50%, pharma services gross margin is currently in the low 30% range, and is expected to improve with revenue growth and the success of our planned integration activities.

Total business gross profit for the first quarter of 2020 was $3.1 million and gross margin was 34%. First quarter 2019 gross profit was $3.4 million, while gross margin was 56% and was all related to our legacy clinical services business. Operating expense for the first quarter of 2020 was $9.2 million as compared to $6.7 million in the first quarter of 2019. Operating expenses were lower than the $9.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, resulting from cost initiatives put in place late in the first quarter.

In March, we reduced lab costs, discretionary and non essential spending. We decreased salary, employee wages by 10% to 15% starting in mid April. We expect the operating expense to be further reduced in the second quarter of 2020, while volume is expected to remain at reduced levels. As the benefit of integration activities in the second quarter are realized, we will be reorganizing and streamlining recurring finance and accounting costs in the third and fourth quarter of 2020. It should be noted that integration of the pharma services labs in the latter part of the year may require the temporary addition of resources to support these activities, which we anticipate realizing benefit in the first quarter of 2021 and beyond.

First quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA was negative $4.1 million and first quarter 2019 was negative $1.8 million. The increase of $2.3 million is related principally to the addition of pharma services losses not included in the first quarter of 2019. We used $7.1 million of cash from operating activities as compared to $3 million in the first quarter of 2019. The increased cash was due to $2.3 million of pharma services losses and $1.8 million of increased working capital related to the acquisition.

As of March 31, 2020, our cash balance was $13.4 million with $1.2 million of borrowings under our line of credit with approximately $2.6 million of availability under the line. During the first quarter of 2020, we raised $19.5 million net from the issuance of additional Series B preferred stock, and restructured the previously issued Series A preferred stock, now all under the Series B preferred stock. We also issued approximately point $0.4 million net of common stock under our ATM and paid down $1.8 million under our bank line of credit.

In April 2020, we received a $650,000 grant from the Department of Health and Human Services related to the COVID-19 virus and antibody testing, and a $2.1 million cash advance for future Medicare billing reimbursements. As of June 17, 2020, we had a cash position of approximately $16.2 million and borrowings under our line of credit amounting to $3.4 million. To optimize the pharma services lab operations, we are transitioning lab work from Rutherford, New Jersey to our state-of-the-art led facility in Morrisville, North Carolina. We will be investing to facilitate the move, transfer personnel, build out facilities and validate processes over the next several months. We are confident this investment will transition, and transition will result in reduced operating costs and providing more robust platform for our customers in the future.

With that, let me turn the call back over to Jack for his closing statements.

Thanks, Fred. During June, we are seeing that our business, while down approximately 30% from where we were just prior to the pandemic hitting, is recovering nicely and largely as we anticipated. We feel that the worst is behind us. However, there is still much uncertainty related to the coronavirus pandemic. We are pleased to announce the launch of our serology testing to assist in transitioning back to normal. We do believe that one of the important global impacts of the pandemic is an increased awareness of the importance of the role diagnostics play. We're confident that we are well positioned to take advantage of this opportunity with our diversification, focusing on improving diagnosis and customize assay solutions for physicians, patients and pharmaceutical and biotech companies developing products.

At this time, due to uncertainty we are not in a position to provide you with a confident revenue projection for the remainder of 2020. However, we are projecting net revenue for the second quarter of 2020 to be between $5.5 million and $6 million.

Now let me turn the call over to Diego for Q&A.

Thank you, sir [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please state your question.

So, I wanted to drill down a little bit as far as, Fred, you have some commentary on the OpEx for, was that Q2 or the year? Can you give us a little better flavor on Q2 versus Q1 on the OpEx and how that comes out and then, for the balance of the year? And then also, can you correlate that with margins for the second quarter and then coming out or up, how do you that looks for the back half of the year?

So operating expense was $9.5 million in fourth quarter of 2019, and we reduced that to $9.2 million with some of the actions that we took later in the quarter. And then we expect that with the actions that we have in place that operating expense will be d"|2
2020-06-25|"JUNEAU, Alaska - A federal magistrate judge has dismissed a criminal contempt complaint against a man who prosecutors had accused of violating a judge’s order and breaking Alaska quarantine rules following his early release from prison amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Chief U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah M. Smith this week granted a request by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Anchorage to dismiss the case against Duane Byron Fields. Prosecutors in their request cited testimony from Daniel Poulson, an assistant federal defender who had represented Fields.

Poulson had successfully petitioned to have Fields’ sentence in a drug-related case reduced and secured his early release from a prison in California that had been hit hard by the coronavirus. A judge’s May 6 order granting the request cited the need for Fields to follow quarantine and other measures upon release.

But Poulson said he didn’t believe Fields received that order. Fields was released from Federal Correctional Institution Terminal Island in California on May 8, according to court records.

Poulson did not notify the prison of the order or speak with Fields about it, according to Smith’s ruling, which also says Poulson testified he had not had any phone calls with Fields since March due to contact and visitation restrictions at the prison.

Fields testified that because of the restrictions, he did not speak to anyone outside the prison between the end of March and his release, her ruling states.

“The evidence does not show there is probable cause to believe Fields’s disobedience of the order was wilful,” Smith wrote.

Poulson, in response to a request for comment, confirmed to The Associated Press that he did not speak to Fields about the May 6 order or its conditions before Fields’ release.

Chloe Martin, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Anchorage, by email said the admission by the federal defender’s office “is especially concerning given the urgency to self-quarantine during a pandemic, and not only for their client’s sake, but for the health and safety of our community.”

Cindy Franklin, a private attorney appointed to represent Fields in the contempt case in place of the federal defender agency, said prosecutors are trying to blame Poulson when they brought a shoddy case. She called the dismissal the “right result.”

Fields, who has battled cancer, was granted compassionate release by Senior U.S. District Judge James K. Singleton Jr. Singleton, in his May 6 order, said the court “may fashion an appropriate sanction” should Fields fail to follow quarantine or social distancing measures or any other condition of release.

Alaska then required people arriving in the state to quarantine for 14 days to help guard against spreading the coronavirus. Under quarantine, people are to leave their location only for medical emergencies or care.

Singleton’s order stated the probation office was OK with Fields staying with his mother but noted she would require him to quarantine elsewhere first. Poulson indicated Fields could quarantine at an Anchorage hotel where Fields’ daughter worked.

Smith, in her ruling, said when Fields boarded his flight for Anchorage, he carried a notice of release from the U.S. Department of Justice stating he was to be taken to his mother’s home. He went there first, but later went to the hotel when his daughter came to get him. His daughter testified she had not had a chance to tell him about staying at the hotel before he returned to Alaska.

Smith said there were differences in the accounts of Fields and his daughter and that of Probation Officer Timothy Astle, including whether Fields was allowed to go to his mother’s to get clothing. Astle said during calls with Fields there was buffering and periods of poor reception.

Astle found Fields at his mother’s on May 11, when he learned Fields had tested positive for COVID-19 at the prison.

Franklin has said the test came back positive the day before Fields was allowed to travel to Alaska but no one told Fields the result.

The magistrate judge, Smith, said Fields’ family members tested negative and there was no evidence he infected anyone.

Martin said officials continue to monitor Fields’ compliance with conditions of his supervision. Franklin said federal officials seem “absolutely determined that he is going to fail“ when the probation department “has a responsibility to try to help him succeed.”"|1
2020-09-09|"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s acting Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello said on Tuesday that a COVID-19 vaccine would be rolled out for all Brazilians in January 2021.

“We are closing contracts with vaccine manufacturers and the forecast is that a vaccine will arrive for us starting in January next year and we will start vaccinating everyone,” Eduardo Pazuello said in a video posted to social media.

Pazuello and other ministers were responding to questions from Esther Castilho, a 10-year-old YouTuber wearing a cowboy hat. Pazuello did not give details on which vaccine would be rolled out.

Brazil has the third-worst outbreak of coronavirus globally with more than 4.1 million cases, passed this week by India for the second highest number of cases after the United States. More than 127,000 people have died from the disease, according to the official Health Ministry death toll.

The high number of cases has led several vaccine makers to seek out Brazil for clinical trials. The country is testing a potential vaccine from AstraZeneca AZN.L and has signed a memorandum of understanding to receive 30 million doses of it.

Right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, who has downplayed the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, on Tuesday repeated prior statements that vaccination would not be mandatory, although the government would still mount a vaccine campaign.

“People cannot be injected with whatever, or forced,” Bolsonaro said in an afternoon event with Brazilian doctors."|1
2020-09-09|"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Tuesday proposed administering a Russian coronavirus vaccine to nearly 15,000 candidates in upcoming legislative elections so that they can campaign safely.

Russia in August licensed a COVID-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing, a move celebrated by Moscow but questioned by some experts who note that only about 10% of clinical trials are successful.

Maduro’s adversaries are broadly planning to boycott the Dec. 6 vote on the grounds that it is rigged in favor of the ruling Socialist Party, although one faction of the opposition has opened talks with the government to seek vote guarantees.

“It would be a good idea to give the Russian vaccine to the 14,400 candidates who have registered ... so that they can carry out their electoral campaign more comfortably,” Maduro said during a televised address.

He said that in September, some Russian vaccines would arrive for clinical trials, and that in October “other vaccines” would arrive, without elaborating.

Russia’s “Sputnik-V” COVID-19 vaccine produced an antibody response in all participants in early-stage trials, according to results published on Friday by The Lancet medical journal, which noted that long-term trials were still necessary.

Kirill Dmitriev of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, which has backed the vaccine, said at least 3,000 people had already been recruited for the large-scale Sputnik-V trial, and that initial results were expected in October or November.

That trial involves some 40,000 participants, the sovereign wealth fund said in August."|0
2020-09-09|"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia is not worried about AstraZeneca Plc’s decision to put on hold its COVID-19 vaccine trial, its deputy chief medical officer said on Wednesday, as daily cases nudged higher in the country’s coronavirus hot spot.

AstraZeneca on Tuesday said it has paused a late-stage trial of one of the leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates after an unexplained illness in a study participant.

The nature of the case and when it happened were not detailed, although the participant is expected to recover, according to Stat News, which first reported the news.

“With the information that I have got at the moment, I am not worried about it,” Australia’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer Nick Coatsworth told Sky News, adding the hold on trials does not mean the vaccine “is off the table”.

“In some respects, this is a very positive thing because it shows that despite the accelerated vaccine development, safety is the priority of the clinical trialists and investigators.”

Coatsworth said Australia like many other governments has invested in several coronavirus vaccine candidates, “knowing not all of them will get through”.

AstraZeneca’s decision to place the trial on hold comes after a pledge from nine leading U.S. and European vaccine developers on Tuesday to uphold scientific safety and efficacy standards for their vaccines despite the urgency to contain the pandemic.

Australia on Monday said it would get the first doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine in January 2021 if trials proved successful after reaching a preliminary deal in August.

It had also signed an agreement on a COVID-19 vaccine being developed by the University of Queensland. Both these vaccines will be manufactured locally by CSL Ltd.

Australia’s coronavirus hot spot of Victoria on Wednesday, meanwhile, reported its biggest rise in daily cases in three days as the state boosted its contact tracing programme to ease the spread of the virus.

Victoria, which is at the centre of Australia’s second wave of coronavirus outbreak, now accounts for about 75% of Australia’s 26,450 COVID-19 cases and 90% of its 781 deaths.

The state reported 76 new cases and 11 deaths from the virus in the last 24 hours."|0

2020-09-09|"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s currency in circulation and bank deposits rose at a record annual pace in August as companies and households continued to pile up cash to guard against the coronavirus- driven income slump, central bank data showed on Wednesday.

The data underlines the difficulty of prodding companies and households to start spending again, even as the economy gradually re-opens after lockdown measures were lifted in May.

Japan’s M3 money stock - or currency in circulation and deposits at financial institutions - rose 7.1% in August from a year earlier, marking the biggest increase since comparable data became available in 2004, Bank of Japan data showed. The rise topped a 6.5% gain in July.

Bank deposits surged a record 15.3% in August from a year earlier, as the hit to sales from COVID-19 prompted companies to continue to hoard cash as a precaution.

Cash in circulation rose 5.5% in August, matching the pace of gain in July, the data showed.

“Some households may be holding cash at home instead of parking them in bank accounts, as the pandemic makes them cautious of visiting bank branches, a BOJ official told a briefing.

2020-09-09|"TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil futures fell again on Wednesday after a sharp slide in the previous session, as a rebound in COVID-19 cases in some countries undermined hopes for a steady recovery in global demand.

Brent crude LCOc1 was down 25 cents, or 0.6%, at $39.53 a barrel by 0455 GMT after dropping more than 5% on Tuesday to fall below $40 a barrel for the first time since June.

U.S. crude CLc1 was down 28 cents, or 0.8%, at $36.48 a barrel, having fallen nearly 8% in the previous session.

Both major oil benchmarks are trading at around three month lows.

The global health crisis continues to flare unabated with cases rising in India, Great Britain, Spain and several parts of the United States.

The outbreak is threatening hopes for a global economic recovery that could reduce demand for fuels from aviation gas to diesel, although the price slump could lift refinery profits back into positive territory, Eurasia said in a note.

“That would be a major move and potentially a sign for the industry that the crude production and processing capacity reductions have finally met their goal in adjusting the industry in line with lower demand,” it said.

Record supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+ have helped support prices, but with grim economic figures being reported almost daily, the outlook for demand for oil remains bleak.

China’s factory gate prices fell for a seventh straight month in August although at the slowest annual pace since March, suggesting industries in the world’s second-biggest economy continued their recovery from the coronavirus-induced downturn."|1

The number of deaths also climbed by 39 over the last 24 hours to reach a total of 30,764.

France has the world’s seventh-highest COVID-19 death toll, and authorities are scrutinising the data to see what measures might be needed to help it cope with an expected second wave of the virus this winter.

The government has said that while it will do all it can to avoid another nationwide lockdown, such as that imposed across the country from March to May, it will nevertheless keep all its options open.

Health Minister Olivier Veran said earlier on Tuesday that the COVID-19 situation was worrying, although he felt a big second wave of infections could be avoided.

“The reproduction rate of the virus stands at 1.2 which is less than the 3.2-3.4 level seen during the spring. So the virus is spreading at lesser speed but it is circulating, which is worrying”, Veran told France Inter radio."|1

2020-09-09|"(Reuters) - Several states in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast have seen new COVID-19 cases increase for two weeks in a row, though nationally both new infections and deaths last week remained on a downward trend, a Reuters analysis showed.

The United States reported more than 287,000 new cases in the week ended Sept. 6, down 1.4% from the previous week and marking the seventh straight week of declines. More than 5,800 people died from COVID-19 last week, the third week in a row that the death rate has fallen.

Nevertheless, 17 states have seen cases rise for at least two weeks, according to the Reuters tally of state and county reports. They include Missouri, North Dakota and Wisconsin, where between 10% and 18% of people tested had the new coronavirus.

In the Northeast, Delaware, New Hampshire, New Jersey and New York also reported increases in new cases for at least two weeks, though the positive test rate ranged from a low of 0.9% in New York to a high of 4.3% in Delaware -- below the 5% level the World Health Organization considers concerning.

In some states, testing has increased as schools reopened. New York City, for instance, is testing 10% to 20% of students and staff every month. The University of Illinois is testing students twice a week.

Nationally, the share of all tests that came back positive for COVID-19 fell for a fifth week to 5.5%, well below a peak of nearly 9% in mid-July, according to data from The COVID Tracking Project, a volunteer-run effort to track the outbreak.

The United States tested on average 741,000 people a day last week, up 5% from the prior week, but down from a peak in late July of over 800,000 people a day.

2020-09-09|"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe will resume domestic flights from Thursday and international flights next month in a boost to tourism, but travellers will be required to have COVID-19 clearance certificates, the government said.

The Southern African nation suspended flights and shut its borders in March as it sought to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected 7,388 people and resulted in 218 deaths.

The government said in a statement that domestic flights would resume on Sept. 10, while international flights would start on Oct. 1.

“All travellers will be required to have a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) COVID-19 clearance certificate issued by a recognised facility within 48 hours from the date of departure,” the statement said.

A COVID-19 lockdown has until now closed all tourist attractions, forcing some hotels and resorts to lay off workers. The government expects the tourism sector to contract 7.4% this year."|1
2020-09-09|"(Reuters) - New York will require kindergarten through 12th grade schools to disclose the number of students and staff testing positive for COVID-19 and may force colleges with more than 100 cases to switch to remote learning, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday.

Cuomo said the regulations would provide a check on the procedures put in place by colleges and give parents transparency about testing at elementary through high schools.

“You have all your protocols. That’s nice,” Cuomo told a news conference. “If the state sees a cluster - just like colleges, just like workplaces, just like restaurants - we see a cluster in a school we are going to come in, override everything.”

Cuomo criticized the administration of New York University for not preventing a large gathering of students in nearby Washington Square Park in New York City on Saturday night, and listed several other colleges in the state that have had spikes in COVID-19 cases.

He said colleges must now report to the state’s health department when they have in excess of 100 cases, a threshold that would require a shift to remote classes unless there were extenuating circumstances.

“Colleges across the country are seeing outbreaks,” he said. “This is going to be a problem.”

Cuomo, a Democrat, also accused Republican President Donald Trump of “trying to kill New York City” by not approving infrastructure projects and not advocating for federal aid to states to deal with the economic fallout from the pandemic.

Earlier on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Republican leaders will introduce a proposal for additional coronavirus relief on Tuesday. The proposal is expected to have a far smaller scope than the $3 trillion bill passed in the Democratic-led House of Representatives in May.

Cuomo said the president and the Senate would court economic disaster if they did not approve federal aid to states.

“If they don’t provide a response the national economy will suffer for years,” he said."|0
2020-09-09|"LONDON (Reuters) - British firms hired temporary staff in August at the fastest pace since the end of 2018 as they tried to recover from the COVID-19 lockdown but remained wary of the pandemic and the Brexit impasse, a recruiters industry group said.

There was also a jump in the availability of candidates which rose at the second-steepest rate in over 20 years, reflecting redundancies announced by many companies in Britain.

Billings from temporary hirings rose for the first time in seven months, the Recruitment & Employment Confederation and accountants KPMG said on Wednesday.

Employers typically rely on temporary workers at times of economic uncertainty.

There was also a rise in billings from companies hiring permanent workers in August but the increase was worryingly small, the REC said.

“It reflects the uncertainty businesses face about what will happen over coming months with the pandemic and Brexit,” Neil Carberry, the chief executive of the REC, said.

Carberry urged the government to settle its differences with the European Union and strike a trade deal.

The survey’s gauge of demand for staff deteriorated in August after three months of improvement.

Britain looks set for a sharp rise in unemployment as the government winds down its emergency coronavirus job retention scheme by the end of next month.

Carberry called on the government to cut employers’ social contribution requirements and offer them more help with skills training."|1
