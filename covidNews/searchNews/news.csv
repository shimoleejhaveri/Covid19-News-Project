nearly 11 million coronavirus relief payments totaling some 14 billion went to dead people a government watchdog reported thursday|washington — nearly 11 million coronavirus relief payments totaling some 14 billion went to dead people a government watchdog reported thursday legal and political issues hang over the misdirected taxpayer funds the latest example of errors in massive aid being dispensed at crisis speed more than one hundred and thirty million socalled economic impact payments were sent to taxpayers as part of the 24 trillion coronavirus relief package enacted in march the government accountability office congress auditing arm cited the number of erroneous payments to deceased taxpayers in its report on the government programs while the government has asked survivors to return the money its not clear they have to it also may be a politically sensitive gambit for the treasury department to aggressively seek to claw back the money especially because some recipients may have died in the early months of this year from covid19 when billions in aid are rushed out the door in a crisis “these are the kinds of things that happen” said lisa gilbert executive vice president of advocacy group public citizen gilbert acknowledged the sensitivity of the issue but she added “its a big number particularly at this moment when our economy is in freefall its a large amount of taxpayer money thats not doing what it was intended to do” the errors occurred mainly because of a lag in reporting data on who is deceased its a lapse that tax experts say is almost inevitable the revelation of more than 1 billion in public money erroneously paid out shines a light on the part of the governments massive relief program with which most ordinary americans are most familiar it follows disclosures that several major restaurant chains and other publicly traded companies had received emergency loans under the 670 billion program for the nations struggling small businesses “gao found that more than 1 trillion in taxpayer funds have already been obligated — including more than 1 billion to deceased individuals — with little transparency into how that money is being spent” rep carolyn maloney dny chair of the house oversight and reform committee said in a statement the irs didnt use death records to prevent payments to deceased individuals for the first three batches of payments because of the legal interpretation the agency was operating under the gao report says the irs asked in may for the money back from the deceased taxpayers survivors some legal experts have said the government may not have the legal authority to require that it be returned spokespeople for the treasury department and the irs didnt return requests for comment thursday on the report and whether the governments position remains that the survivors must return the money the payments were by paper check direct deposit or debit card all adults earning up to 75000 in adjusted gross income annually were entitled to 1200 that amount steadily declined for those earning more and phased out for people earning over 99000 former taxpayer advocate nina olson has said there is nothing in the law prohibiting payments from going to the deceased nor is there anything in the law requiring people to return the payments she notes that the language used on the irs website does not say that returning the payments is required by law the relief payments were made to taxpayers based on the information filed on their two thousand and nineteen or two thousand and eighteen taxes but it is considered a rebate on two thousand and twenty taxes the government used the previous tax forms to help speed along payments to the public to offset some of the economic devastation from the coronavirus pandemic but some people who filed those taxes may no longer be alive those payments are sent to an heir or executor of their estate if the payment is based off a final tax return completed after their death an economic impact payment check may even denote next to that persons name that the individual is deceased “i think the irs will do little or nothing to pursue collection of these payments” keith fogg clinical professor at harvard and an expert in tax law said thursday “the cheapest way for the irs to collect is offset of a future refund that avenue will not exist for these taxpayers i dont think the irs will take the somewhat difficult steps to pursue the heirs for this amount of money”|2020-06-25|-0.2298|negative|0.079408797417272|positive

the virus doesnt care which party affiliation you might have lets place the blame where it belongs|there was a time in march when it felt like we were all united in attacking covid19 but that honeymoon was short lived by the end of april the virus had become partisan if you listen to some voices you would believe the coronavirus and its disastrous repercussions are the fault of one man roy cooper thats the narrative increasingly coming from republicans and those on the right they ask “why does one man have so much power to make decisions that affect us all” or “why wont he listen to the legislature when they dictate the opening of bars gyms bowling alleys and nightclubs” they generally conclude with “doesnt he know he has wrecked the economy of our state that there are more than a million people out of work” those and other questions will only be intensified after the governors announcement keeping phase two restrictions in force democrats are equally emphatic things would not have gotten so bad had president trump not initially refused to recognize the pandemic been willing to develop a coherent and consistent national strategy and accepted any accountability heres my spin the coronavirus doesnt care to which political party you belong where you live or anything else while it might be easy to place blame on a governor or even the president lets put the blame where it belongs – on the virus the biggest criticism of governor cooper centers around his singular power in making decisions people forget we elected him to be governor the chief executive officer of our state our statutes grant the executive extraordinary powers during times of emergency governor cooper could blunt some of the criticisms if he would tell us who he consults give their names and say how often he does so i could perhaps agree that the governor should consult with and seek consensus from the council of state with two reservations first i have watched committees deliberate decisions and the process does not lend itself to timely and decisive action in times of crisis at least now we have one person to hold accountable further i could be more supportive if there was some confidence those statewide elected officials would give nonpartisan advice this council of state already proved they wouldnt do so when republican members signed a petition attempting to force cooper to consult with them no democrats signed that petition yes there is a statute which says the governor should get concurrence from the council of state in some instances however it is so vague and poorly written that a former supreme court justice said a case could be made for requiring concurrence but could just as equally support the position the governor didnt have to do so the legislature is attempting to change that statute but would do well to consider setting a precedent they may someday regret one day there will be another republican governor perhaps forced to face an unfriendly democratic majority in the council of state the virus doesnt care about any of this but we should i hope you agree we are weary of the partisan bickering at a time when we should be uniting to fight this virus the health of our people and our economy are more important that partisan infighting we are better than this|2020-06-25|-0.6925|negative|0.0832420183982684|positive

with nascars conclusion of its own inquiry into why a noose was hanging in bubba wallaces garage at talladega we break down what happened and what the sport plans to do going forward to prevent similar incidents|nascar president steve phelps defends the sense of urgency of investigating the noose in bubba wallaces garage but adds he should have used the word alleged 100 its difficult to recall a more emotional more confusing and yet inspiring few days during nascars 72year history than what unfolded since 1045 pm et on sunday june 21 the roller coaster began when nascar released a statement sunday night that a noose had been found in the talladega superspeedway garage stall belonging to the circuits only black fulltime driver bubba wallace it ended tuesday with the fbi stating it would not pursue federal charges after its investigation at talladega in between there was outrage and an unprecedented show of support for wallace perhaps more than for any driver since dale earnhardt won the one thousand nine hundred and ninetyeight daytona 500 late tuesday there was relief among people in the nascar garage some embarrassment among those same people and gleeful celebrations on social media from those who claimed it was a hoax from the beginning but just two days later nascar on thursday completed its investigation into the garage pull rope formed as a noose that was found in wallaces garage at talladega on sunday with president steve phelps saying the noose was real and our initial reaction was to protect our driver we review an eventful few days and try to answer questions many have asked as nascar and the fbi wrapped up their investigations this week was there a noose found in bubba wallaces garage at talladega yes nascar officials and fbi investigators have not disputed that rope pulldowns are installed on the roller doors in every bay of the talladega superspeedway garage according to nascar every one of those pulldowns was checked as part of the fbi investigation and the only one of those fashioned into a noose was the rope in garage no 4 which was assigned to the richard petty motorsports no fortythree chevy this past weekend fbi special agent johnnie sharp jr led a team of fifteen fbi investigators as they inspected the garage and interviewed multiple people around talladega superspeedway including wallace in his official statement written with us attorney jay e town sharp used the word noose four times and never disputed it was a noose  saying only that the timing of its hanging in garage no 4 at least as early as october 2019 meant it was not directed at wallace and thus was not a federal crime wallace was no purposely assigned to garage four at talladega garage workspaces are assigned to teams per their rank in the nascar cup series standings furthermore because of covid19 pandemicrelated social distancing policies team garage assignments have been even more spread out than normal making the idea of slotting a certain team in a certain garage seem even less plausible the fbi stated that nobody could have known mr wallace would be assigned to garage number four last week and that as a result no federal crime had been committed when asked about how frequently he has seen door pulls shaped in such a fashion bubba wallace said on espns first take on wednesday ive been racing since i was nine years old im twentysix now ill be twentyseven this year and ive never seen a garage pull like that it makes me want to drive over to my moms house where we used to race out of our garage and show a garage pull why did nascar conduct its own inquiry while the fbis investigation concluded the noose was not specifically linked to wallace it still said the noose was in garage 4 so why that was the main reason for nascar  to identify the person who tied the rope into a noose and why they did it whether it be a nascar crew member track worker or someone else with access to the garage before or during october 2019 also why was it not noticed until now eight months later phelps addressed all of the above thursday when he discussed nascars findings during a conference call with reporters phelps said nascar conducted a full sweep of all twentynine tracks where they hold races and the 1684 garage stalls within those tracks only eleven had a pulldown rope tied into a knot and only one specifically tied into a noose  the one identified in garage four at talladega we further determined that the noose was not in place when the october two thousand and nineteen race weekend began but was created at some point during that weekend phelps added given that timing and the garage access policies and procedures at the time we were unfortunately unable to determine with any certainly who tied this rope in this manner or why it was done so how did the noose go undetected up until this past weekend said phelps our ultimate conclusion is to ensure this never happens again that no one walks by a noose without recognizing the potential damage it can do  moving forward we will be conducting thorough sweeps of the garage area to ensure nothing like this happens again part of those updated protocols include installing extra cameras in all garages making necessary changes to nascars code of conduct and mandating that all members of our industry complete sensitivity and unconscious bias training with specifics and timing forthcoming why didnt nascar initially show the photo of the noose officials said they didnt release the photo sunday night because their internal investigation was still ongoing at that point all evidence submitted as part of the fbi investigation including the photo and video used to reveal the noose was visible in the same garage during the october two thousand and nineteen race weekend was returned to nascar after the fbi released its findings nascar released a photo of the noose thursday in conjunction with phelps conference call after it concluded its own investigation here is the image did wallace ever see the noose not until nascar brought it to his attention sunday night again because of pandemic team roster restrictions and the nature of a oneday race schedule a very limited number of people were allowed into the garage area at all one member of the no fortythree team found the noose reported it to nascar security and then took it to nascar president steve phelps and his executive team this was widely reported sunday night and monday despite what bubba was in on it conspiracy theorists might tell you were nascar officials embarrassed by the fbis report and how they handled the incident yes and no with a much higher percentage toward no they arent happy about the optics of it all and they certainly havent enjoyed those conspiracy theorists believing they scored a win but they also dont regret acting as swiftly and as publicly as they did phelps reiterated just that thursday saying that in hindsight he should have used the word alleged as part of his original statement sunday night the nascar president did not however show any regrets for protecting one of his drivers some feel that the phrasing or words used were not right that comes with the territory and i will take full responsibility for that and for the emotion that was attached to it phelps said based on the evidence we had we felt that one of our drivers had been threatened a driver who had been extremely courageous in recent words and actions it was our responsibility to react and investigate and thats exactly what we did i stand by the actions we took and i think they were the right ones phelps added given the evidence we had we would do the same thing we would investigate it the same way if it comes to where we need to craft a statement differently and i need to take a little less emotion out of it thats something ill do and ill take responsibility for that what has been wallaces response to the fbi report wallace first spoke to cnn on tuesday night while social media platforms were fueled with multiple wallacerelated trending topics none of them nice during the interview he reiterated that what was found in garage four at talladega wasnt merely a garage door pull from the evidence that we have and i have its a straightup noose  it was a noose that was whether tied in two thousand and nineteen or whenever it was a noose it wasnt directed at me but somebody tied it wallace also reiterated his position on using his platform to continue to push for change in the sport and beyond if you had seen the ahmaud arbery video and if it shook you the way it shook me knowing that i wanted to make change i wanted to go down there and retaliate for that family and for that man wallace said on first take but i knew hate doesnt win love wins its about spreading the right message and we go through the breonna taylor incident and then we go through the george floyd incident  to get where change i believe is really happening whenever i get time away from interviews and get time to think i am going to be on phone calls about what are the next steps for us in showing that we care and were gonna make changes instead of just saying it we have to have actions to back it up phelps reiterated nascars support of wallace and other drivers on thursday bubba wallace and the fortythree team had nothing to do with this bubba wallace has done nothing but represent this sport with courage class and dignity phelps told reporters it is offensive seeing anyone suggest otherwise and frankly its further evidence of how far we still need to go as a society bubba has done nothing but represent this sport with courage class and dignity and he stood tall for what he believes in and we all need to stand with him i know im going to|2020-06-25|0.9697|positive|0.06272274633123688|positive

safeguarding development gains and ensuring that recovery aligns with efforts to achieve greater wellbeing for people and planet secretarygeneral antónio guterres told the economic and social council as he outlined priorities for the systems operational activities mr guterres presented his report on the matter document a7579e202055 to the councils operational activities for development segment which took place through a series of virtual meetings from nineteen to twentytwo may and on twentyseven may participating governments reviewed four years of guidance outlined in general assembly resolution 71243 on the quadrennial comprehensive policy review of united nations operational activities as well as progress in implementing assembly resolution 72279 on the repositioning of the development system “our objective remains clear to help countries navigate and accelerate progress towards achieving the sustainable development goals” mr guterres said in his keynote address reforms have placed the united nations on the right footing “together we have created a new coordination system for development” he said governments have transformed united nations structures tools funding and mindsets to better advance the two thousand and thirty agenda for sustainable development thanks to a renewed spirit of collaboration the system is working more effectively across all dimensions — and on track in effecting the change measures mandated by the two thousand and sixteen policy review and two thousand and eighteen resolution on repositioning the development system in addition a new generation of united nations country teams is taking shape he said better adapted to country needs and able to harness expertise throughout the system new cooperation frameworks are now based on integrated support to governments business operations emphasize transparency and accountability and the resident coordinator is being recognized as the empowered impartial leader of development efforts at the country level “we have ensured full gender parity among resident coordinators” he added and following last weeks round of appointments those from the global south have reached fifty per cent looking ahead he urged the council to make progress on the outstanding dimensions of the management and accountability framework for country teams the “challenging but necessary” work on efficiencies efforts to diversify the skills of resident coordinators and on finding ways to meet their funding needs he also underscored the importance of concluding all remaining mandates stressing that a year has passed since the council first reviewed his proposals to reinvigorate the regional architecture the time has come to move forward “i am sharing tailored proposals for a better organized more collaborative united nations development system at the regional level” he said the detailed plan before delegates will ensure greater efforts are made across the social economic and environmental dimensions of the sustainable development goals “in the space of a single quadrennial comprehensive policy review we have deeply transformed the united nations development system” he said “we count on you to continue to assume ownership over the new united nations development system provide guidance and hold us accountable along the way” echoing that call council president mona juul norway described the operational activities segment as an “accountability platform” to evaluate the performance and results of the united nations development system since the two thousand and sixteen policy review and historic reforms launched by the secretarygeneral in 2018 “we must provide guidance to the united nations system on how it can best support the implementation of the two thousand and thirty agenda in the coming four years” she asserted in those efforts womens rights and gender equality must remain a priority working methods and culture — throughout the united nations and among donor and programme countries — still need to be overhauled during the segment she said the council will consider the last pieces of the repositioning reform the review of regional assets and multicountry offices she urged delegates to reflect on where the united nations should be in the coming four years stressing that the council has until the fall to elaborate the guidance it will provide to the two thousand and twenty policy review “together we will deepen our efforts…to recover better and build a healthier greener fairer and a more resilient world” she said juan sandoval mendiolea mexico chair of the segment said that beyond the jargon and technicalities the issues are about realizing the two thousand and fifteen pledge to leave no one behind “the covid19 pandemic has reminded us of the fragile reality of the human condition” he said “we have witnessed tragic losses” encouraging delegates to keep this in mind during the discussions he said the endeavour requires a machinery that is “up to the task” the development system comprises more than one hundred and thirty resident coordinators and country teams “working 247” in one hundred and sixty countries and territories he said while the council has advanced various aspects of the policy review there are “chapters that we are yet to close” he said notably the revamping of united nations regional assets and review of multicountry offices he encouraged delegates to clarify how regional commissions agencies funds and programmes and the development coordination office will work together to help countries achieve the two thousand and thirty agenda multicountry offices are a vital tool for addressing the historic deficit in the united nations development offer to small island developing states “if we succeed in…strengthening our support to multicountry offices we will be able to cope with this gap” he said throughout the segment the council held a series of interactive dialogues aimed at evaluating results and actions stemming from the repositioned development system and other reforms after which liu zhenmin undersecretarygeneral for the united nations department of economic and social affairs delivered closing remarks about the particular importance of this years discussions he emphasized that the current segment marks the start of preparations for the next quadrennial comprehensive policy review which the general assembly will conduct later in 2020 as the novel coronavirus wreaks havoc across the globe the united nations response must protect hardwon advances and put in place systems and policies that will allow for reaching ambitious goals “this spirit of ‘rebuilding better guides the support extended by the united nations sustainable development group and country teams to countries response to the pandemic” he said a key message he takes from the discussions is about the tremendous support for the work of the development system “you trust that it has been moving swiftly in implementing the reforms you mandated and repositioning itself to help countries achieve the sustainable development goals and battle the covid19 pandemic” he called for continued work to ensure that the leadership and prerogatives of the resident coordinators are fully reflected in the behaviours of the united nations system and in all entities guidance to their country representatives as efforts turn to elaborating new cooperation frameworks “we must fully use this process to reconfigure united nations country teams” he said he looked forward to feedback on the secretarygenerals recommendations on regional assets and multicountry offices noting that the draft resolution to be presented by the “group of 77” developing countries and china will be of critical importance turning to the two thousand and twenty policy review he said participants expressed support for the systems focus on poverty eradication it will be important to strengthen the united nations work in this area — notably on ensuring social protection and access to quality public services the two thousand and twenty review should also address the integrated policy support that member states expect in order to accelerate implementation of the goals the system needs to adjust its offers and respond to these demands especially in the areas of growth and employment or climate change where it has been less present in the past he said tailoring such support has been a core objective of the reforms and expressed his expectation that proposals on multicountry offices will improve the support extended to small island developing states as the secretarygeneral has worked to ensure that least developed countries are prioritized in all programming and budgeting it will also be critical to reflect on how the development system can best respond to the needs of middleincome countries “overall we need to accelerate the shift from a traditional model of direct support and service provision towards highquality integrated policy advice capacity development and support for leveraging partnerships and financing” in such efforts the department is ready to play its part offering its analytical and intergovernmental work and “stands ready to support your deliberations as you prepare the two thousand and twenty quadrennial comprehensive policy review” he assured following the opening the council moved into an interactive discussion with the secretarygeneral moderated by mr sandoval mendiolea delegates evaluated how the repositioned development system is responding to the covid19 pandemic at national regional and global levels elaborating on specific aspects that have been improved and whether the united nations overall is providing enhanced support

how the lockdown is helping us rediscover whatrsquos important|ashley used to spend a lot of time on the road in any given month before the outbreak the 35yearold healthcarebenefits adviser might make a fourhour drive for a onehour client meeting or hop a fourhour flight for a oneday industry event the time away from her life and partner in chicago wore on her but on march 12 the same day the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic ashleys office officially closed and she began working from home now she meets clients and connects with colleagues virtually the change has given her more time to think but also to worry her best friends husband works as a nurse on the front lines and she feels that both her and her partners jobs are at risk “i would not be surprised if one of us gets laid off in the next six months” she said there have been positives too ashley spends more time cooking and improving her home and she feels closer to loved ones than ever as family videocalls have become a fixture of her life this shift she told us has recalibrated her priorities ashley now wants to find a way to dedicate more time and energy to activities beyond her job “this experience has really confirmed my desire to change careers” she said “so that i can work fewer hours and spend more time with friends and family” dozens of people weve heard from across eight countries said similar things the idea of having the time we spend align with our values as ashley describes is not new behavioral scientists study it and clay christensen wrote about it as the idea of congruence—of ones personal values actions and work environment what is novel during this period of disruption however is how globally universal the emphasis on personal reflection and reevaluation seems to be candice a 33yearold userexperience designer living in england perhaps put it best “covid is changing all our lives” she said “and forcing us to look at whats essential and whats not” as people the world over grapple with that issue here are a few trends weve observed in our conversations deepening personal relationships people said that their highest priority has always been family and their loved ones but it hasnt always translated into the way they spend time the pandemic is changing that giuseppe 49 told us that despite the challenges facing his autoparts business in rome the lockdown has brought him “pleasure and comfort” as hes spent more time with family and rediscovered his passion for traditional italian cooking meanwhile in the united kingdom charlotte a 33year old science teacher said that “focusing on family rather than materialism”—in particular spending more time with her elderly parents—is a change she wants to make coming out of the crisis reassessing whats essential for happiness for those not struggling with the daytoday cost of living the pandemic has created a welcome decelerated pace of life and work that finds people reevaluating how much income and professional achievement they need to be happy clara who works in germany as a freelancer and sets her own hours said that shes “thinking about working less because i now see you can get by with less” and faith 48 who balances two jobs with two teenage sons and caring for her elderly mother says her work is less rewarding “professional goals feel less important for me now” she said “i just feel like there isnt any joy in it for me anymore” embracing a healthfirst mindset good health matters to people across every country socioeconomic level and age group in our research one of our respondents from india a 30yearold hr manager named davya might well have spoken for everyone when she said “the positive longterm changes to my life are health health and only health no matter how busy we are or whatever we are packed with i see how important it is to take some time off for our physical and mental health” whether these priority shifts will solidify into new behaviors let alone new behaviors that stick is hard to know right now but we can look at these shifts and start to get a sense of the factors that may shape the choices people will make when the next normal arrives based on what were hearing its unlikely that well return fully to the way things were before so what does all this mean for leaders the new tradeoff employers need to be aware that their existing notions about how to motivate and inspire people may not survive the pandemic as workers personal career goals change so might their willingness to trade things like salary for flexibility a shorter commute or a slower pace of work elsewhere more people may choose to work for nonprofits than corporations worklife balance has been a staple of corporate rhetoric for some time the companies unable to make it a staple of corporate reality could soon be left behind the new boss from a business perspective the lesson is perhaps even starker walmart founder sam walton once said “there is only one boss the customer and he can fire everybody in the company from the chairman on down simply by spending his money somewhere else” in that sense at least from a behavioral perspective companies are perhaps about to get a bunch of new bosses the customer behavior businesses thought they understood has perhaps left the building for good to be replaced by something new that will need to be assessed—and responded to—very quickly benjamin a 42yearold married father of two summed it up in a colorful way he works as an it manager in singapore and told us that living through the pandemic for the past two months has completely changed his outlook on work life and what really matters to him “i used to think i can make big money and live the lavish lifestyle i want” he said “i learned that health is the most important stay strong and healthy like a stray cat it doesnt need a nice home or big salary but it can eat and sleep well at any place it likes” thanks for reading for more stories

your decisions now will determine how strongly you come out of the covid19 crisisand how well you perform in the next normal|some corporate leaders still wrestling with the immediate challenges stemming from the coronavirus pandemic may see growth as a distant priority once the health of employees is protected and the financial stability of the business secured however executives will shift their focus to whats next for most restarting the stalled growth engine will become an imperative—but those who wait until all lockdowns are lifted and a recovery takes hold may find they had waited too long previous economic crises have shown us that companies paths to recovery are shaped by their industries regions and individual corporate characteristics—but also very much by the actions they take before during and after the crisis recent mckinsey research found that the outperforming companies during and after the financial crisis entered it ahead of competitors and came out of it stronger than before our analysis of the performance and growth strategies of approximately 2000 companies between two thousand and seven and two thousand and seventeen reinforces those conclusions staying focused on throughcycle growth is critical for longterm survival and the ability to generate excess total returns to shareholders trs that means you need to plan ahead for the next stage of this crisis and for the postpandemic era even as you navigate the current economic shocks our study shows that roughly one in ten companies achieved higher revenue growth and profitability than the others in our sample over the entire 2007–17 economic cycle as well as during the downturn years these throughcycle outperformers also delivered excess trs of roughly eight percent while the rest hovered around zero throughout the period exhibit 1 what did the throughcycle outperformers do differently first leaders of these companies had a clear throughcycle mindset they were prepared to modulate their spending in the short term pulling back in some areas but ramping up in others all the while protecting their innovation and sales capabilities critically they also remained committed to their longterm growth strategies not shying away from making big bets secondly they aggressively freed up resources before and during the crisis—enough to enable them to invest early in their own recoveries the throughcycle outperformers secured cash ahead of the crisis compared to other companies they had twenty percent more excess cash on hand and while they temporarily slowed their expenditures on operations rd and other areas they diverged from their peers by quickly ramping up spending during the recovery period these outperformers increased their absolute capital expenditures by ninety percent during the recovery period compared with an average increase of twentyfive percent importantly the throughcycle outperformers launched specific growth interventions focusing on three dimensions • when to grow the biggest winners grew right through the downturn but other outperformers managed to catch up by stepping hard on the gas in the first two years of the recovery • where to grow some outperformers reallocated resources to lesscyclical parts of their existing businesses thereby strengthening the core others moved into adjacent industries to capture new opportunities or complement existing ones and still others expanded into highgrowth geographies beyond their home markets • how to grow many outperformers went beyond organic growth initiatives launching or expanding ma programs or building new capabilities such as digital channels and offerings to enhance productivity and improve access to highgrowth customer segments exhibit 2 as business leaders begin to think again about growth the actions of the throughcycle outperformers a decade ago provide valuable lessons some companies especially in asia that are already pivoting toward life in the postcrisis phase are showing how those lessons can be applied today growing your business while the economy is collapsing around you is a tough job—but not an impossible one some companies are doing so today thanks to their presence in sectors such as healthcare or logistics that are experiencing surging demand for others this crisis may pose challenges unlike any they had experienced before yet planning or even launching growth initiatives could deliver big payoffs as long as your cash position and balance sheet are strong of the throughcycle outperformers during the financial crisis a full ninetyfive percent managed to grow during the downturn achieving an average compound annual growth rate cagr of 52 percent between two thousand and seven and 2009 the outperforming companies spanned most industries except for consumer packaged goods cpg automotive and materials the last largely due to low commodity prices this portion of the throughcycle outperformers did not grow during the actual downturn but made up for it by revving up their growth engines soon after as the recovery started they launched aggressive growth moves and grew three times faster than their peers throughout the recovery phase the takeaway starting growth during a downturn produces the best results but if that isnt possible you can make up ground in the recovery provided you accelerate boldly however if you wait until the economy has fully stabilized you will have lost the opportunity to gain an edge on competitors the outperforming companies in the two thousand and eight crisis focused their growth interventions on three areas in order to account for changes in their markets during and after the downturn first they reallocated resources to lesscyclical parts of the business one global manufacturer for instance doubled down on its services business which was less vulnerable to demand volatility the equipment it sold or leased would need monitoring and repair in any economic conditions the company developed a new approach to maintaining the equipment that reduced the length of time it was unavailable it also invested in people training technicians on a new maintenance protocol which in turn improved employee engagement as a result the revenue from services mainly maintenance grew at double the annual rate from around five percent in two thousand and seven to ten percent in 2012 companies seeking to shift resources toward less cyclical opportunities should first analyze their business portfolios at a very detailed level for performance growth potential and connection with economic cycles they should then dedicate both money and talent to addressing the opportunities they identify the throughcycle outperformers also moved into adjacent industries to capture new opportunities or complement existing ones for example one large construction and engineering firm whose main business was in construction and maintenance of waterways adapted its core offerings during the crisis to include services for maritime oil and gas and environmentaltechnology customers—niches experiencing higher growth and poised for strong performance during the recovery by 2017 more than thirty percent of the firms revenue was coming from this work up from two percent a decade earlier another company a south american retailer added a financing arm during the downturn to serve its lowincome customers by 2011 the new business line was growing at five times the rate of the core business thoroughly understanding the trends and emerging needs of customers is crucial when looking for attractive adjacencies today companies should explore and prioritize adjacencies against a set of boundary conditions such as the ability to leverage an existing technical competency or build on existing customer relationships companies also need to weigh whether to enter these priority areas organically by adjusting their business models or investing in innovation or by proactively sourcing potential acquisition targets the third growth strategy pursued by many outperformers during the last crisis is expansion into highgrowth regions beyond their home markets these companies achieved 15 to 20 times higher share of revenue from noncore regions during the last crisis than the others in our sample one global retailer for instance expanded its operations in a rapidly developing eastern european country doubling its number of stores there between two thousand and seven and two thousand and twelve to capture that markets growth as with moves to adjacent industries expansion to highgrowth geographies requires a systematic vetting process and a granular analysis of market opportunities beyond just country borders the first step should be defining the companys objectives—for instance is the goal wider distribution more sales or simply establishing a new core market understanding those objectives can make it easier to size potential markets and identify and pursue both organic and inorganic growth opportunities there through partnerships or licensing agreements for instance given that emergence from this economic crisis is likely to be highly uneven it is also important to take a “micromarket” view of growth as some regions countries cities and even neighborhoods will ease lockdowns sooner than others many of the throughcycle outperformers during the last economic crisis sought to grow in two ways through ma or by developing or enhancing new capabilities in fact threequarters of these outperformers executed transactions during or right after the last downturn during the financial crisis the outperformers invested in larger deals with the median deal size almost double that of their peers then during the recovery period they did ten percent more transactions than other companies in our sample and throughout both periods a programmatic approach to ma—meaning several deals per year amounting to a meaningful portion of market capitalization—proved to be most successful for example one large industrial company pursued acquisitions in the double digits to enhance its technical capabilities—up from only two such deals two|2020-05-27|0.9991|positive|0.1050340282255176|positive

how researchers can tackle an “infodemic” of hearsay speculation and fake news|do researchers and frontline clinicians have a moral obligation to communicate science around the coronavirus in the second episode of this sixpart working scientist podcast series about science communication pakinam amer explores crisis communication and asks how well researchers have explained the underlying uncertainties to the public epidemiologist sandro galea dean of boston university school of public health says academic researchers have three roles to generate scholarship and science to teach that science to students and to clearly translate it for a general audience “our job is to help the world see how we can bridge the science to the very real practical decisions that the world has to make to create a healthier world” he says but how is science communication evolving during the pandemic “we are entering a new era we need a new playbook for communicating science in a time of uncertainty and how policy can be informed by uncertain science we have not done that well” he tells her “there has been this mismatch between what we do not know and our capacity to communicate what we do not know and to inform policy that needs to be made anyway those have been glaring gaps in my assessment” ron daniels a criticalcare consultant at university hospitals birmingham nhs foundation trust sees a role for scientists to plug knowledge gaps alongside the understandably “cautious and riskaverse messages that often emanate from government and professional bodies daniels produced a short video in response to calls to explain why covid19 patients are ventilated on their stomachs using a simple drawing on a white board to explain the underlying physiology “people want to make sensible informed decisions with a very filtered and controlled flow of information coming from government which is designed to avoid panic and instil calm making informed decisions can be challenging” “this is not about profile this is not about gaining followers or scoring points usually this should not be about academic argument this should be around ive appraised the evidence i have a level of expertise here are my opinions and this is what i think you as a member of the public should do with that information” what about journalists reporting on the pandemic and busting myths and misinformation how does their communication role differ from scientists and clinicians on the frontline us science journalist roxanne khamsi says “i feel some kind of personal obligation to try to disseminate what i know which is a fraction of what virologists know i dont want to oblige anyone to do anything if folks have the time there has never been a more urgent time to communicate your science” us photojournalist and science writer tara haelle adds “i think journalists and scientists in general have done a reasonably good job of trying to focus on the good information and counter the bad information it is a hard job to do the entire base of science is uncertainty it is a quest for knowledge if you had the knowledge you would not be seeking it” anica butler editor of the boston globe ideas section tells amer how she works with scientist contributors who submit expert opinion pieces to the newspaper “i think of myself as standing in for the public i am going to ask stupid questions “the editor is trying to help your work be understood by the average everyday person in a crisis like this that is the ultimate goal think about you explaining to your next door neighbour here is what is happening”|2020-05-27|-0.9634|negative|0.03169612794612798|positive
decisions about the countrys research flagship will signpost national priorities|south koreas highestprofile investment in basic research is in the institute for basic science ibs a network of research centres that comprises the nations answer to germanys max planck society and japans riken founded in two thousand and eleven after a two thousand and seven promise by conservative lee myungbak during his successful campaign for the countrys presidency the institute sought to attract elite researchers from at home and abroad by giving successful individual applicants as centre directors full autonomy over their centres research and a budget of ten billion won us82 billion per year for ten years the centres cover areas including dark matter nanomaterials genome engineering and climate change but after criticism that they were taking money away from the greater scientific community the goal of fifty centres has been reduced to thirty for now with average budgets trimmed to about six billion won ibs president noh do young warns that the cuts are “likely to inhibit ibss efforts to fulfil its missions and visions” arguing that the budgets are not large considering centres can employ dozens of researchers each many ibs researchers say the level of funding has helped their research reach new heights for instance in march 2020 the center for rna research at seoul national university used cuttingedge sequencers purchased with ibs funds to become one of the first research groups in the world to sequence the transcriptome — the total product of all expressed genes — of the coronavirus that caused the covid19 pandemic1 the sequencers can directly identify the molecules in rna sequences as well as where they are modified by other molecules narry kim a biochemist and the centres director says the work required an interdisciplinary team of virologists microbiologists and computational scientists which was enabled by ibss steady support “without ibs funding i dont think it would have been possible” she says among other prominent ibs results the center for genome engineering supplied the geneediting tools in a blockbuster two thousand and seventeen study2 in nature that claimed the crispr–cas9 geneediting system was used to correct a mutation that causes heart disease in viable human embryos by replacing the mutated copy from the sperm with the correct gene from the egg the results have been hotly debated as some scientists argue there could be alternative explanations in 2018 results reported in nature3 by the center for underground physics from its laboratory in a subterranean power plant in yangyang county near the countrys east coast ascribed constraints to the theorized particles that could make up dark matter and in 2019 a collaboration including the center for climate physics in busan proposed in nature4 that the first ancestors of modern humans came from a prehistoric wetland in modernday botswana roughly 200000 years ago the work combined the centres supercomputer climate models with a genetic analysis of populations in namibia and south africa ibs came under heavy scrutiny in 2019 when reports surfaced in south korean media of misappropriated funds and nepotism in hiring which had allegedly been uncovered by government audits at several centres doochul kim a physicist who was president of ibs at the time said these were mostly the result of administrative errors and that the audits were politically motivated by liberal lawmakers in late 2019 kim announced reforms to ibss administrative structure to be carried out under his successor noh who started in november 2019 the year two thousand and twenty marks another significant milestone for ibs the first group of centres are coming up for review unlike at the max planck society centre directors at ibs are not awarded a lifetime appointment and centres are subject to a makeorbreak review after eight years to determine if they will be extended beyond their original tenyear remit “this review session will shape the future of ibs” says noh he says centres may close as a result although new centres may take their place noh adds that the process may be delayed by the covid19 pandemic if crucial onsite visits by international reviewers scheduled for july cannot go ahead the model has its advocates “i like that pressure” says andreas heinrich who left ibm almaden in san jose california to lead the ibs center for quantum nanoscience in seoul “if i cannot build a topclass research centre in eight years either im not the right person for the job or its not possible in that environment”|2020-05-27|0.9685|positive|0.0877603528546925|positive
by redirecting funding to small teams the country is betting on the creativity of its scientists|when it comes to funding research south korea is in rarefied air as a percentage of its gross domestic product its spending on research and development is second only to israels the speed of this ascent has been dizzying up from 21 of its gross domestic product in 2000 when it was equal to the average of organisation for economic cooperation and development member nations to more than 45 in 2018 with israel alone surpassing it at 49 according to the latest available figures but this surge has not been even rather it has favoured topdown governmentdirected projects intended to boost competitiveness in fields such as artificial intelligence robotics and materials often in partnership with the private sector consistent with the postwar focus on applied research that turned south korea into a leader in semiconductor manufacturing and wireless communication networks new priorities however have taken root for the past decade the necessity to invest in basic research has been a common refrain from south korean researchers and politicians alike to maintain economic growth the nation has sought to become a ‘first mover instead of simply a ‘fast follower — rhetoric embraced by the current liberal president moon jaein and his predecessor the conservative park geunhye the drive to compete more effectively in strategic fields continues but south korea has begun emphasizing bottomup funding for small teams of researchers betting that strength will flow from the creativity of its scientists on paper the rhetoric is backed by funding under president moon who was first elected in 2017 the basicresearch budget for south koreas main funding agency the national research foundation nrf has skyrocketed under a fiveyear plan to double it by two thousand and twentytwo to 25 trillion won us2 billion the nations budget for two thousand and twenty allows for a remarkable 18 increase from the previous year in government spending on research and development rd to 242 trillion won in the private sector which makes up roughly threequarters of rd spending basicresearch spending is also surging including outlays by major conglomerates such as samsung and lg electronics “industry is asking universities to produce more and more phds” says han woong yeom a physicist at pohang university of science and technology and vicechair of moons presidential advisory council on science and technology “the situation cannot be better than this in terms of investment” spending surged over the past two decades on large national projects such as a lunar orbiter scheduled for launch in 2022 a nanomaterials research effort dubbed the ‘creative materials discovery program and koreas branch of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor the main experiment of which is under construction in southern france “previously more emphasis was on the missionoriented research towards immediate economic output” says microbiologist junghye roe whom moon tapped to lead the nrf in 2018 there is a new emphasis on bottomup funding through nrf grants currently the nrf accounts for slightly more than onequarter of total governmentfunded research with a budget of close to seven trillion won in 2020 the amount spent on basicresearch grants to principal investigators is now roughly equal to that spent on topdown missionoriented projects and roe hopes to boost the basicresearch grants still further recent highlights from these grants include a gallium arsenide nanoresonator that can trap light and change its colour work published in science1 in january and coled by honggyu park of korea university in seoul atmospheric observations from gosanri on jeju island as part of an international study2 coled by sunyoung park of kyungpook national university in daegu and published in nature in 2019 that identified eastern china as a major source of the emission of chlorofluorocarbons chemicals that destroy the ozone layer that are banned under the montreal protocol and the finding that the development of osteoarthritis is related to how the body processes cholesterol in a two thousand and nineteen nature study3 led by jehwang ryu of chonnam national university in gwangju and jangsoo chun of the gwangju institute of science and technology the topdown division can claim successes too including playing a key role in the nations ability to quickly develop and produce diagnostic kits for covid19 says roe the first four companies to win urgentuse approval for their tests had all received nrf funding to research the production of such kits after the two thousand and fifteen middle east respiratory syndrome mers outbreak in south korea infected one hundred and eightysix people and killed 36 and in february the korea aerospace research institute responsible for the nations space programme launched the cheollian 2b satellite its main instrument the geostationary environment monitoring spectrometer gems is designed to monitor air pollution in the asiapacific region making it the first of a new generation of satellites intended to study global air quality an emphasis on governmentmandated metrics in hiring and promotion which critics say incentivizes researchers to present work of little value in lowquality journals or conferences remains to be addressed last may the nations education ministry reported that five hundred and seventyfour researchers had participated in international conferences organized by ‘predatory publishers “that happens because so far we have emphasized getting large numbers of quantitative shallow publications” says roe “i think this oldstyle culture is prohibiting the booming of our creativity” says yeom “this may still be good enough to produce many papers but not original ideas” the outlook is uncertain not only does the expected heavy economic burden of recovering from the covid19 pandemic threaten to curb the growth in rd budgets but south koreas traditional industries — including chipmaking shipmaking and nuclear power — face increased competition from china political tensions with japan that flared in july 2019 fuelled by that nations legacy of colonial rule threatened to cut off supplies of key materials for semiconductor production exposing how heavily the nations technology industry relies on japanese manufacturers there is talk in policy circles of a science and technology new deal — a boost in funding and programmes to combat the effects of a less globalized world in which south koreas access to scientific supplies and talent is reduced says so young kim director of the korea policy center for the fourth industrial revolution a think tank affiliated with kaist in daejeon yeom says researchers stand to benefit from a public appetite for societal change which also translates into support for increased science funding yeom and other policymakers are pushing for greater investment in research topics that meet the practical needs of south korean society such as air pollution and an ageing population in response the moon administration has begun an initiative to trace and reduce fine particulate matter across northeast asia and another to fight dementia some suspect it will be initiatives such as these that do most to move south korea away from the label ‘fast follower “the definition of toplevel research doesnt need to be the highest impact factor or highest citation count” says roe pursuing research directions that benefit south korean society is “making our own path a new path rather than following others”|2020-05-27|0.9965|positive|0.10195288342609769|positive

activities segment dialogue with the united nations sustainable development group chair and heads of entities — working together to accelerate sustainable development goal sdg progress during the decade of action and in light of the covid19 pandemic in new york today it is a great pleasure to join you today alongside my colleagues from the united nations sustainable development group unsdg i commend the ecosoc economic and social council bureau for organizing this segment on behalf the secretarygeneral and the unsdg i want to recognize our chair ambassador sandoval for leading this segment with great passion and determination to make it a success despite the limitations posed by covid19 we were all hoping for a landmark operational activities segment firmly positioned as the main accountability platform for the systems collective support to the two thousand and thirty agenda and in my opinion the segment has delivered just that today i am accompanied by a small yet critical group of principals who embody the commitment and diversity of the wider unsdg my colleagues have not only ensured timely changes to the working modalities and policies of their entities in response to the guidance of the general assembly they have also led critical workstreams of the unsdg from achim steiners able coordination of the core group of the unsdg as my vicechair through the steady progress made in advancing systemwide partnerships under the cochairship of henrietta fore and guy ryder to the tireless work of phumzile mlambongcuka and inger andersen in anchoring all that we do in strong foundations of sustainability and gender equality i also want to recognize undersecretarygeneral liu for the department of economic and social affairs support to all of these discussions another champion of the unsdg — dr tedros — could not be here today for reasons we can all understand but we are in good hands with dr jakab we are here to today to share some of the experiences of our new generation of united nations country teams and illustrate how each agency is rewiring its work to strengthen coordination and help countries scale up efforts to achieve the sustainable development goals but most importantly we are here to listen to your guidance and perspectives over the past few days we have reported on progress in implementing the two thousand and sixteen quadrennial comprehensive periodic review and repositioning the united nations development system we have provided extensive data on where we stand we have introduced a firstofitskind report on the operations of the development coordination office the secretarygeneral has put forward detailed proposals to deliver on the remaining qcpr quadrennial comprehensive periodic review mandates throughout the segment we have heard your views questions and guidance on the direction of our travel the secretarygeneral and i are heartened by your continued support and commitment for the implementation of the two thousand and thirty agenda the covid19 pandemic hit just as we were preparing for this milestone ecosoc operational activities segment in many ways it could have hindered our efforts it could have put a pause in the organization of this segment or even to the repositioning process itself well it has not thanks to your leadership and determination the segment has highlighted how the pandemic underscores the urgency of our efforts and the imperative to act we are now better prepared to adapt and respond swiftly to crises switching gears to “development emergency mode” stronger leadership and new accountability systems in united nations country teams have helped ensure integrated support to governments with strong coordination support to resident coordinators by dco and technical leadership from the world health organization who undp and office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in the unsdg principals worked together to develop a framework for action by united nations country teams while reprogramming resources and programmatic assets to support the response an independent coordination system for development has also enabled stronger collaboration with other pillars i am especially grateful to the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs peacebuilding support office and the office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights ohchr for their substantive inputs which have helped inform our response to covid19 and for the backstopping support they provide to united nations country teams facing special crises and vulnerabilities the ecosoc discussions with resident coordinators and united nations country teams members last week have helped to put faces behind the data and statistics in our reports coming from countries as diverse as china yemen haiti mauritius uruguay and armenia our field colleagues shared their perspectives on how reforms were being implemented as a living experience on the ground the substantive discussions on the regional review and multicountry offices showed once more the immense opportunity offered by these components to take our reform efforts even further colleagues from regional commissions and other regional offices of the united nations have helped address many of your remaining questions on the regional repositioning their interventions also provided tangible examples of how the proposed changes to enhance collaboration and transparency in regions can lead to major improvements in our support to the two thousand and thirty agenda the session on multicountry offices also revealed how far we have come together to get this package right i am convinced that we need to continue to move forward together in a continuous dialogue and i am also convinced that the time has come to move forward with urgency and step up our support to small island developing states the majority of which are serviced by multicountry offices we emerge from this segment with an everclearer vision of member states positions and expectations on areas that will require a deeper focus moving forward i thank each and every one of you for stressing your support for conveying your perspectives for asking the hard questions for identifying areas where we still need to engage and clarify as i have said before we do not take your trust for granted we heard you carefully on questions that remain unclear and on areas that require further attention to consolidate and i believe that in the course of this session our principals will help clarify additional issues i agree with all those member states who have stated that we must ensure a transparent implementation process should we receive your agreement to move ahead in implementing the remaining mandates you can count on my determination to move ahead in full transparency ensuring frequent reporting to member states and proposing adjustments to course correct as needed we have also heard you loud and clear on the need to continue to consolidate results and deeply engrain the reforms in the work of all parts of the united nations system and its partners several delegations also underscored their wish to see continued progress in our efforts to ensure more efficient operations leave no one behind and strengthen the collaboration between development and humanitarian action and its linkages to peace the secretarygeneral is determined to continue to move ahead with the same ambition that has marked the reforms from the begging and the unsdg is already taking steps to accelerate progress on all these aspects while also improving its overall ability to provide strategic direction and support to our new generation of united nations country teams the secretarygeneral and i are grateful to member states for putting their weight behind the historic funding compact we agreed upon last year even though we are at an early stage we see commitment and progress on all sides this is encouraging and symbolic few reform elements illustrate our spirit of mutual responsibility better than our funding compact it is also important because only the funding compact can help ensure that the funding base of the united nations development system incentivizes coordination rather than competition the covid19 crisis has provided a tragic reminder of the importance of core budgets for united nations development entities and of a wellresourced coordination function for the system next years review by the general assembly of the resident coordinator system and its funding model will be a welcome opportunity to make any further adjustments needed for now we are on the right track you have set an ambitious transformation path for the united nations development system — a path that could only be delivered through a collective vision and dedicated efforts on all sides at times we had to come out of our comfort zones and institutional positions to make the impossible possible it has paid off we now have the structures accountabilities and coordination tools in place to move with energy to implementation on the ground let us remain fully mobilized now is the time to push forward and leverage our reforms to help the world win this epic battle against a virus our achievements thus far were made possible thanks to your leadership and by the collective efforts of the united nations sustainable development group without the support of each member of the united nations country teams a reinvigorated resident coordinator system would not be possible this is a collective effort for which the secretarygeneral and i are deeply appreciative once again we are now in the steady hands of member states we count on your decisive action to close the current deeply transformative chapter of the qcpr we look forward to swift decisions on the remaini|2020-05-27|0.9999|positive|0.10347901281724808|positive
cansino and moderna are the first vaccine makers to report data on safety and neutralization but the extent of protection these products afford remains unclear|cansino biologics and a team of researchers from seven different chinese institutions have published the results of a phase one trial of the companys sarscov2 spike s protein vaccine the intramuscularly injected adenoviral vaccine elicited both neutralizing antibodies and a tcell response in a phase one study in one hundred and eight volunteers a week earlier moderna raised a cool 134 billion in a share offering after it pressreleased preliminary data from just eight healthy volunteers from a phase one trial of its mrna vaccine candidate against sarscov2 the limited data released suggest that their vaccine can stimulate the production of neutralizing antibodies and appears to be safe in a tiny group of individuals it is not clear how these relate to antibody responses in the general population cansinos openlabel doseescalation study found that 75–83 of patients in three groups each with a different dosage 5 × 1011 one × one thousand and twelve or five × one thousand and twelve viral particles reported at least one adverse reaction by day 7 such as pain at the injection site and sometimes fever fatigue headache and muscle pain the effects were most severe at the highest dose and the vaccines developers plan to take the medium dose into a phase two trial tantalizingly the preliminary data also indicate the adenoviral serotype five ad5 vaccine generates neutralizing antibody and tcell responses although whether the reported responses will prove to be protective is open to question “we have no idea what titers are needed to protect” says hildegund ertl professor in the wistar institutes vaccine  immunotherapy center the lack of a standardized virus neutralization assay for sarscov2 complicates data interpretation “as long as people are using different assays its going to be hard to figure that out” but just 50 of those who received the medium dose developed neutralizing antibodies a rate that ertl says “is not particularly good” the tcell response was “not particularly impressive” either the choice of the ad5 vector flies in the face of the experience of more than a decade ago with mercks failed step trial in hiv in which preexisting antibodies against another ad5 vector undermined that vaccines efficacy about half of the participants in the present trial exhibited high levels of preexisting antibodies against ad5 a prevalence similar to that in the general population in china the prevalence rates in the united states and in africa are about 45 and 80–90 respectively which will constitute “a large handicap” should the vaccine gain approval “do i think its a winner no” ertl says “its better than nothing”although various types of vaccine are in development against the new coronavirus sarscov2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 — including mrna vaccines recombinant subunit vaccines recombinant viral vectors inactivated virus vaccines and vaccines based on viruslike particle technology — they all converge on the s protein a trimeric glycoprotein that enables the virus to enter host epithelial cells modernas data also provide preliminary confirmation that a vaccine targeting the s protein can induce a systemic neutralizing antibody response at least in adults aged up to fiftyfive years moderna has not disclosed the neutralizing antibody titers but claims they were “at or above levels generally seen in convalescent sera” given the wide variability in the human antibody response to any pathogen it is unclear what this means “without seeing the data i cannot make an intelligent assessment” says michel nussenzweig professor and howard hughes medical institute investigator at the rockefeller university who is also a senior physician at the rockefeller university hospital nussenzweig and colleagues recently reported in a biorxiv preprint that the level of neutralizing antibodies in the plasma of sixtyeight convalescent individuals was low in a majority but nevertheless even those with modest levels of neutralizing activity could still produce potent antibodies directed at the receptorbinding domain of the s protein adolfo garciasastre professor of microbiology at the icahn school of medicine at mt sinai hospital says despite the lack of published data “its quite encouraging not only for modernas vaccine but for other vaccines too in general i feel quite encouraged” he warns however that the systemic antibody response to modernas vaccine may not lead to mucosal immunity even if the vaccine confers protection against lower respiratory tract infection subjects may still be vulnerable to a subclinical but potentially contagious infection of the nasal mucosa “what is unclear is how much protection from viral shedding can happen in the upper respiratory tract” garciasastre says the phenomenon is well recognized in influenza — most vaccines mainly protect against infection of the lower respiratory tract “the upper respiratory tract is more difficult to protect” he says the extent to which mrna1273 can induce a neutralizing antibody response in older subjects is another critical question — and the answer will soon become apparent the phase one trial sponsored by the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid is now recruiting people aged fiftysix and older across three dose cohorts the initial glimpse of safety data from the study has moreover informed the design of an upcoming phase two trial of the three doses used to test for immunogenicity the highest two hundred and fifty micrograms has been dropped from the protocol because of the

will be aged fiftyfive years and over a phase three trial will get underway in july once early safety data from the phase two study emerge garciasastre remains apprehensive about the longerterm perspective “im still concerned about the regulatory pathway needed to approve the vaccine” he says “if an efficacy trial is required its going to be challenging to do it” a field trial requires free

the rest of the world should worry too|t of hong kong want two things to choose how they are governed and to be subject to the rule of law the chinese communist party finds both ideas so frightening that many expected it to send troops to crush last years vast protests in hong kong instead it bided its time now with the world distracted by covid19 and mass protests difficult because of social distancing it has chosen a quieter way to show whos boss that threatens a broader reckoning with the world—and not just over hong kong but also over the south china sea and taiwan on may 21st china declared in effect that hong kongers deemed to pose a threat to the party will become subject to the partys wrath a new security law written in beijing will create stilltobe defined crimes of subversion and secession terms used elsewhere in china to lock up dissidents including uighurs and tibetans hong kong will have no say in drafting the law which will let china station its secret police there the message is clear rule by fear is about to begin this is the most flagrant violation yet of the principle of “one country two systems” when the british colony was handed back to china in 1997 china agreed that hong kong would enjoy a “high degree of autonomy” including impartial courts and free speech many hong kongers are outraged see article some investors are scared too the territorys stockmarket fell by 56 on may 22nd its biggest drop in five years hong kong is a global commercial hub not only because it is situated next to the chinese mainland but also because it enjoys the rule of law business disputes are settled impartially by rules that are known in advance if chinas unaccountable enforcers are free to impose the partys whims in hong kong it will be a less attractive place for global firms to operate chinas move also has implications far beyond hong kong “one country two systems” was supposed to be a model for taiwan a democratic island of 24m that china also sees as its own the aim was to show that reunification with the motherland need not mean losing ones liberty under president xi jinping china seems to have tired of this charade increasingly it is making bareknuckle threats instead the reelection in january of a chinasceptic taiwanese president tsai ingwen will have convinced chinas rulers that the chances of a peaceful reunification are vanishingly small on may 22nd at the opening of chinas rubberstamp parliament the prime minister li keqiang ominously cut the word “peaceful” from his ritual reference to reunification china has stepped up war games around taiwan and its nationalists have been braying online for an invasion china is at odds with other countries too in its building of island fortresses in the south china sea it ignores both international law and the claims of smaller neighbours this week hundreds perhaps thousands of chinese troops crossed chinas disputed border with india in the himalayas minor scuffles along this frontier are common but the latest incursion came as a stateowned chinese paper asserted new claims to land that its nucleararmed neighbour deems indian see article and as a sombre backdrop to all this relations with the united states are worse than they have been in decades poisoning everything from trade and investment to scientific collaboration however much all the regional muscleflexing appals the world it makes sense to the chinese communist party in hong kong the party wants to stop a “colour revolution” which it thinks could bring democrats to power there despite chinas best efforts to rig the system if eroding hong kongs freedoms causes economic damage so be it party bigwigs reason the territory is still an important place for chinese firms to raise international capital especially since the sinoamerican feud makes it harder and riskier for them to do so in new york but hong kongs is equivalent to only 3 of mainland chinas now down from more than 18 in 1997 because the mainlands economy has grown 15fold since then chinas rulers assume that multinational firms and banks will keep a base in hong kong simply to be near the vast chinese market they are probably right the simple picture that president donald trump paints of america and china locked in confrontation suits chinas rulers well the party thinks that the balance of power is shifting in chinas favour mr trumps insults feed chinese nationalist anger which the party is delighted to exploit—just as it does any tensions between america and its allies it portrays the democracy movement in hong kong as an american plot that is absurd but it helps explain many mainlanders scorn for hong kongs protesters the rest of the world should stand up to chinas bullying on the sinoindian border the two sides should talk more to avoid miscalculations as their leaders promised to in 2018 china should realise that if it tries the tactics it has used in the south china sea building structures on disputed ground and daring others to push back it will be viewed with greater distrust by all its neighbours in the case of taiwan china faces a powerful deterrent a suggestion in american law that america might come to taiwans aid were the island to be attacked there is a growing risk that a cocksure china may decide to put that to the test america should make clear that doing so would be extremely dangerous americas allies should echo that loudly hong kongs options are bleaker the hong kong policy act requires america to certify annually that the territory should in trade and other matters be treated as separate from china this week the secretary of state mike pompeo declared that “facts on the ground” show hong kong is no longer autonomous this allows america to slap tariffs on the territorys exports as it already does to those from the mainland that is a powerful weapon but the scope for miscalculation is vast potentially harming hong kongers and driving out global firms and banks it would be better as the law also proposes to impose sanctions on officials who abuse human rights in hong kong also britain should grant full residency rights to the hundreds of thousands of hong kongers who hold a kind of secondclass british passport—much as ms tsai this week opened taiwans door to hong kong citizens none of this will stop china from imposing its will on hong kong the partys interests always trump the peoples ■|2020-05-28|-0.988|negative|0.06690247843173375|positive

contrary to what many americans think the death rate in america is about the same as in europe|editors note some of our covid19 coverage is free for readers of the economist today our daily newsletter for more stories and our pandemic tracker see our coronavirus hub a passed a grim milestone 100000 deaths from a novel coronavirus that began to spread half a year and half a world away many americans think their president has handled the epidemic disastrously that their country has been hit uniquely hard and that there is a simple causal relationship between the two the 100000 which does not include excess deaths mistakenly attributed to other causes is higher than any other countrys it has routinely been compared with the 60000 american casualties in the vietnam war a trump death clock in times square purports to show how many lives the presidents ineptitude has cost as we went to press it stood at 60262 yet this widespread conviction that america has failed because of donald trump is not supported by the numbers or at least not yet the official death rate in america is about the same as in the european union—which also has excess deaths but has less erratic leaders and universal health care overall america has fared a bit worse than switzerland and a bit better than the netherlands neither of which is a failed state new york has been hit about as hard as lombardy in northern italy california acted early and is currently similar to germany so far rural states have like central europe been spared the worst this reflects two things both of which will matter now that america is reopening before it has the virus fully under control the first is that covid19 when it first hit displayed an indifference to presidents and their plans around the world it has killed in large dense and connected cities like new york london and paris and where people are crammed together including care homes slaughterhouses and prisons in some countries including america testing was snarled up in red tape having seen what was happening in china mr trump could have acted sooner—as taiwan singapore and vietnam did he has failed to do things ordinarily expected of an american president in a crisis such as giving clear government advice or coordinating a federal response instead he has touted quack remedies and spent the days when america passed its sombre milestone spreading suspicion of the voting system and accusing a television host of committing a murder that never happened all this is reprehensible and it may have been costly yet tempting as it is to conclude that the presidents failures bear most of the blame for covid19s spread through america the reality is more complicated see briefing that leads to the second feature of the countrys response to covid19 the virus was always going to be hard on a population with high levels of poverty obesity and diseases such as diabetes especially among minorities see lexington but to a remarkable degree other layers of government have adapted around the hole where the president should have been the federal system has limited the damage thanks to its decentralised decisionmaking lockdowns vary by state city and county california responded as soon as it saw cases in the northeast governors largely ignored the white house and got on with coping with the disease earning the republican governors of maryland and massachusetts the presidents enmity but high approval ratings in florida though the governor was reluctant to impose a lockdown county officials went ahead and did so anyway contrary to demands for nationwide rules this is a strength not a weakness and will become more so as the pandemic runs its course in the bestorganised states which have built up testing capacity it helps ensure that flareups can be spotted quickly and rules adjusted accordingly because each region is different that is more efficient than a nationwide approach one way democracies can deal with the virus is to draw on reserves of trust people must behave in ways that protect fellow citizens whom they have never met even if they themselves are feeling fine americans trust their local officials far more than the president or the federal government and when it comes to public health those local officials have real power without this balancing feature america might today look like brazil where a president with a similar love of hydroxychloroquine and distaste for face masks is wreaking havoc see article if the publichealth response in the united states so far matches europes its economic response to the virus may turn out better true the unemployment rate in america is 15 double that in the  yet in europe most governments are protecting jobs that may no longer exist once lockdowns end rather than focusing help on the unemployed as americas has the is probably delaying a painful adjustment congress not known for passing consequential legislation with big bipartisan majorities agreed on a vastly bigger fiscal stimulus than in the financial crisis a decade ago with a democrat in the white house and a republicancontrolled senate america might not have mustered a response that was either so rapid or so large america still has a hard road ahead were daily fatalities to remain at todays level which is being celebrated as a sign that the pandemic is waning another 100000 people would die by the end of the year to prevent that america needs to work with the system it has trusting local politicians to balance the risks of reopening against the cost of lockdowns in the next months the infrastructure built during the lockdown must prove itself because the virus has yet to decline in some states it may flare up in new places which will then need targeted lockdowns the capacity to test vital to spotting clusters of infection has increased but is still lacking in some places almost all the states lack the contact tracers needed to work out who needs testing and quarantining when it considers how to withdraw fiscal support congress should remember this that america and europe have fared similarly in the pandemic does not absolve mr trump this is the first international crisis since one thousand nine hundred and fortyfive in which america has not only spurned global leadership but by cutting funds to the world health organisation actively undermined a

cansino and moderna are the first vaccine makers to report data on safety and neutralization but the extent of protection these products afford remains unclear|cansino biologics and a team of researchers from seven different chinese institutions have published the results of a phase one trial of the companys sarscov2 spike s protein vaccine the intramuscularly injected adenoviral vaccine elicited both neutralizing antibodies and a tcell response in a phase one study in one hundred and eight volunteers a week earlier moderna raised a cool 134 billion in a share offering after it pressreleased preliminary data from just eight healthy volunteers from a phase one trial of its mrna vaccine candidate against sarscov2 the limited data released suggest that their vaccine can stimulate the production of neutralizing antibodies and appears to be safe in a tiny group of individuals it is not clear how these relate to antibody responses in the general population cansinos openlabel doseescalation study found that 75–83 of patients in three groups each with a different dosage 5 × 1011 one × one thousand and twelve or five × one thousand and twelve viral particles reported at least one adverse reaction by day 7 such as pain at the injection site and sometimes fever fatigue headache and muscle pain the effects were most severe at the highest dose and the vaccines developers plan to take the medium dose into a phase two trial tantalizingly the preliminary data also indicate the adenoviral serotype five ad5 vaccine generates neutralizing antibody and tcell responses although whether the reported responses will prove to be protective is open to question “we have no idea what titers are needed to protect” says hildegund ertl professor in the wistar institutes vaccine  immunotherapy center the lack of a standardized virus neutralization assay for sarscov2 complicates data interpretation “as long as people are using different assays its going to be hard to figure that out” but just 50 of those who received the medium dose developed neutralizing antibodies a rate that ertl says “is not particularly good” the tcell response was “not particularly impressive” either the choice of the ad5 vector flies in the face of the experience of more than a decade ago with mercks failed step trial in hiv in which preexisting antibodies against another ad5 vector undermined that vaccines efficacy about half of the participants in the present trial exhibited high levels of preexisting antibodies against ad5 a prevalence similar to that in the general population in china the prevalence rates in the united states and in africa are about 45 and 80–90 respectively which will constitute “a large handicap” should the vaccine gain approval “do i think its a winner no” ertl says “its better than nothing”although various types of vaccine are in development against the new coronavirus sarscov2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 — including mrna vaccines recombinant subunit vaccines recombinant viral vectors inactivated virus vaccines and vaccines based on viruslike particle technology — they all converge on the s protein a trimeric glycoprotein that enables the virus to enter host epithelial cells modernas data also provide preliminary confirmation that a vaccine targeting the s protein can induce a systemic neutralizing antibody response at least in adults aged up to fiftyfive years moderna has not disclosed the neutralizing antibody titers but claims they were “at or above levels generally seen in convalescent sera” given the wide variability in the human antibody response to any pathogen it is unclear what this means “without seeing the data i cannot make an intelligent assessment” says michel nussenzweig professor and howard hughes medical institute investigator at the rockefeller university who is also a senior physician at the rockefeller university hospital nussenzweig and colleagues recently reported in a biorxiv preprint that the level of neutralizing antibodies in the plasma of sixtyeight convalescent individuals was low in a majority but nevertheless even those with modest levels of neutralizing activity could still produce potent antibodies directed at the receptorbinding domain of the s protein adolfo garciasastre professor of microbiology at the icahn school of medicine at mt sinai hospital says despite the lack of published data “its quite encouraging not only for modernas vaccine but for other vaccines too in general i feel quite encouraged” he warns however that the systemic antibody response to modernas vaccine may not lead to mucosal immunity even if the vaccine confers protection against lower respiratory tract infection subjects may still be vulnerable to a subclinical but potentially contagious infection of the nasal mucosa “what is unclear is how much protection from viral shedding can happen in the upper respiratory tract” garciasastre says the phenomenon is well recognized in influenza — most vaccines mainly protect against infection of the lower respiratory tract “the upper respiratory tract is more difficult to protect” he says the extent to which mrna1273 can induce a neutralizing antibody response in older subjects is another critical question — and the answer will soon become apparent the phase one trial sponsored by the

the rest of the world should worry too|t of hong kong want two things to choose how they are governed and to be subject to the rule of law the chinese communist party finds both ideas so frightening that many expected it to send troops to crush last years vast protests in hong kong instead it bided its time now with the world distracted by covid19 and mass protests difficult because of social distancing it has chosen a quieter way to show whos boss that threatens a broader reckoning with the world—and not just over hong kong but also over the south china sea and taiwan on may 21st china declared in effect that hong kongers deemed to pose a threat to the party will become subject to the partys wrath a new security law written in beijing will create stilltobe defined crimes of subversion and secession terms used elsewhere in china to lock up dissidents including uighurs and tibetans hong kong will have no say in drafting the law which will let china station its secret police there the message is clear rule by fear is about to begin this is the most flagrant violation yet of the principle of “one country two systems” when the british colony was handed back to china in 1997 china agreed that hong kong would enjoy a “high degree of autonomy” including impartial courts and free speech many hong kongers are outraged see article some investors are scared too the territorys stockmarket fell by 56 on may 22nd its biggest drop in five years hong kong is a global commercial hub not only because it is situated next to the chinese mainland but also because it enjoys the rule of law business disputes are settled impartially by rules that are known in advance if chinas unaccountable enforcers are free to impose the partys whims in hong kong it will be a less attractive place for global firms to operate chinas move also has implications far beyond hong kong “one country two systems” was supposed to be a model for taiwan a democratic island of 24m that china also sees as its own the aim was to show that reunification with the motherland need not mean losing ones liberty under president xi jinping china seems to have tired of this charade increasingly it is making bareknuckle threats instead the reelection in january of a chinasceptic taiwanese president tsai ingwen will have convinced chinas rulers that the chances of a peaceful reunification are vanishingly small on may 22nd at the opening of chinas rubberstamp parliament the prime minister li keqiang ominously cut the word “peaceful” from his ritual reference to reunification china has stepped up war games around taiwan and its nationalists have been braying online for an invasion china is at odds with other countries too in its building of island fortresses in the south china sea it ignores both international law and the claims of smaller neighbours this week hundreds perhaps thousands of chinese troops crossed chinas disputed border with india in the himalayas minor scuffles along this frontier are common but the latest incursion came as a stateowned chinese paper asserted new claims to land that its nucleararmed neighbour deems indian see article and as a sombre backdrop to all this relations with the united states are worse than they have been in decades poisoning everything from trade and investment to scientific collaboration however much all the regional muscleflexing appals the world it makes sense to the chinese communist party in hong kong the party wants to stop a “colour revolution” which it thinks could bring democrats to power there despite chinas best efforts to rig the system if eroding hong kongs freedoms causes economic damage so be it party bigwigs reason the territory is still an important place for chinese firms to raise international capital especially since the sinoamerican feud makes it harder and riskier for them to do so in new york but hong kongs is equivalent to only 3 of mainland chinas now down from more than 18 in 1997 because the mainlands economy has grown 15fold since then chinas rulers assume that multinational firms and banks will keep a base in hong kong simply to be near the vast chinese market they are probably right the simple picture that president donald trump paints of america and china locked in confrontation suits chinas rulers well the party thinks that the balance of power is shifting in chinas favour mr trumps insults feed chinese nationalist anger which the party is delighted to exploit—just as it does any tensions between america and its allies it portrays the democracy movement in hong kong as an american plot that is absurd but it helps explain many mainlanders scorn for hong kongs protesters the rest of the world should stand up to chinas bullying on the sinoindian border the two sides should talk more to avoid miscalculations as their leaders promised to in 2018 china should realise that if it tries the tactics it has used in the south china sea building structures on disputed ground and daring others to push back it will be viewed with greater distrust by all its neighbours in the case of taiwan china faces a powerful deterrent a suggestion in american law that america might come to taiwans aid were the island to be attacked there is a growing risk that a cocksure china may decide to put that to the test america should make clear that doing so would be extremely dangerous americas allies should echo that loudly hong kongs options are bleaker the hong kong policy act requires america to certify annually that the territory should in trade and other matters be treated as separate from china this week the secretary of state mike pompeo declared that “facts on the ground” show hong kong is no longer autonomous this allows america to slap tariffs on the territorys exports as it already does to those from the mainland that is a powerful weapon but the scope for miscalculation is vast potentially harming hong kongers and driving out global firms and banks it would be better as the law also proposes to impose sanctions on officials who abuse human rights in hong kong also britain should grant full residency rights to the hundreds of thousands of hong kongers who hold a kind of secondclass british passport—much as ms tsai this week opened taiwans door to hong kong citizens none of this will stop china from imposing its will on hong kong the partys interests always trump the peoples ■|2020-05-28|-0.988|negative|0.06690247843173375|positive

contrary to what many americans think the death rate in america is about the same as in europe|editors note some of our covid19 coverage is free for readers of the economist today our daily newsletter for more stories and our pandemic tracker see our coronavirus hub a passed a grim milestone 100000 deaths from a novel coronavirus that began to spread half a year and half a world away many americans think their president has handled the epidemic disastrously that their country has been hit uniquely hard and that there is a simple causal relationship between the two the 100000 which does not include excess deaths mistakenly attributed to other causes is higher than any other countrys it has routinely been compared with the 60000 american casualties in the vietnam war a trump death clock in times square purports to show how many lives the presidents ineptitude has cost as we went to press it stood at 60262 yet this widespread conviction that america has failed because of donald trump is not supported by the numbers or at least not yet the official death rate in america is about the same as in the european union—which also has excess deaths but has less erratic leaders and universal health care overall america has fared a bit worse than switzerland and a bit better than the netherlands neither of which is a failed state new york has been hit about as hard as lombardy in northern italy california acted early and is currently similar to germany so far rural states have like central europe been spared the worst this reflects two things both of which will matter now that america is reopening before it has the virus fully under control the first is that covid19 when it first hit displayed an indifference to presidents and their plans around the world it has killed in large dense and connected cities like new york london and paris and where people are crammed together including care homes slaughterhouses and prisons in some countries including america testing was snarled up in red tape having seen what was happening in china mr trump could have acted sooner—as taiwan singapore and vietnam did he has failed to do things ordinarily expected of an american president in a crisis such as giving clear government advice or coordinating a federal response instead he has touted quack remedies and spent the days when america passed its sombre milestone spreading suspicion of the voting system and accusing a television host of committing a murder that never happened all this is reprehensible and it may have been costly yet tempting as it is to conclude that the presidents failures bear most of the blame for covid19s spread through america the reality is more complicated see briefing that leads to the second feature of the countrys response to covid19 the virus was always going to be hard on a population with high levels of poverty obesity and diseases such as diabetes especially among minorities see lexington but to a remarkable degree other layers of government have adapted around the hole where the president should have been the federal system has limited the damage thanks to its decentralised decisionmaking lockdowns vary by state city and county california responded as soon as it saw cases in the northeast governors largely ignored the white house and got on with coping with the disease earning the republican governors of maryland and massachusetts the presidents enmity but high approval ratings in florida though the governor was reluctant to impose a lockdown county officials went ahead and did so anyway contrary to demands for nationwide rules this is a strength not a weakness and will become more so as the pandemic runs its course in the bestorganised states which have built up testing capacity it helps ensure that flareups can be spotted quickly and rules adjusted accordingly because each region is different that is more efficient than a nationwide approach one way democracies can deal with the virus is to draw on reserves of trust people must behave in ways that protect fellow citizens whom they have never met even if they themselves are feeling fine americans trust their local officials far more than the president or the federal government and when it comes to public health those local officials have real power without this balancing feature america might today look like brazil where a president with a similar love of hydroxychloroquine and distaste for face masks is wreaking havoc see article if the publichealth response in the united states so far matches europes its economic response to the virus may turn out better true the unemployment rate in america is 15 double that in the  yet in europe most governments are protecting jobs that may no longer exist once lockdowns end rather than focusing help on the unemployed as americas has the is probably delaying a painful adjustment congress not known for passing consequential legislation with big bipartisan majorities agreed on a vastly bigger fiscal stimulus than in the financial crisis a decade ago with a democrat in the white house and a republicancontrolled senate america might not have mustered a response that was either so rapid or so large america still has a hard road ahead were daily fatalities to remain at todays level which is being celebrated as a sign that the pandemic is waning another 100000 people would die by the end of the year to prevent that america needs to work with the system it has trusting local politicians to balance the risks of reopening against the cost of lockdowns in the next months the infrastructure built during the lockdown must prove itself because the virus has yet to decline in some states it may flare up in new places which will then need targeted lockdowns the capacity to test vital to spotting clusters of infection has increased but is still lacking in some places almost all the states lack the contact tracers needed to work out who needs testing and quarantining when it considers how to withdraw fiscal support congress should remember this that america and europe have fared similarly in the pandemic does not absolve mr trump this is the first international crisis since one thousand nine hundred and fortyfive in which america has not only spurned global leadership but by cutting funds to the world health organisation actively undermined a coordinated international response that matters as does mr trumps inability to cleave to a consistent message or to speak to the country in words that do not enrage half of the population yet four years after mr trump was elected the time to be surprised by his behaviour has long gone luckily he has mattered less than most americans

a new report looks at the impact of new money in an old industryand what it means for incumbents startups and investors in last mile delivery|the transport and logistics sector has seen marked improvements in recent decades as new technologies have entered the market efficiency has increased and prices have decreased yet the industry continues to face significant challenges including a high number of breakpoints complex pricing rules and a lack of data standardization while low profitability has made it difficult for the industry to address these issues a new generation of logistics startups aims to solve them in our new report startup funding in logistics new money for an old industry we analyze more than one hundred and twenty of the biggest logistics startups—representing an estimated ninetythree percent or 26 billion of total startup funding in logistics to date—and explore recent funding trends and their implications for incumbents startups and investors the remainder of this article teases out lessons from one chapter of the report for more information on more recent developments see the sidebar “the impact of covid19 on logistics startups and venturecapital funding” venture capitalists vcs have recently invested around 28 billion in logistics startups nearly all of it since 2015 in our sample the number of reported deals was stagnant from two thousand and sixteen to two thousand and eighteen then dropped in 2019 over the same period the average deal size and total funding grew threefold exhibit 1 these findings show that growth is no longer fueled by having multiple funding rounds instead it occurs as startups reach maturity and receive larger funding rounds as in other industries logistics funding is highly concentrated the ten bestfunded companies have received about fortysix percent of total funding and the top twenty about sixtysix percent exhibit 2 most funding goes to startups working on lastmile and freight platforms this significant rise in funding begs the question where does all this money go and what are the trends getting investors excited about this industry most funding around 111 billion was raised by startups offering lastmile delivery services to retailers and individuals—a vc bet that we analyzed in detail in 2017 of this amount 99 billion went to startups that rely on unconventional delivery modes such as crowdsourced delivery drones autonomous vehicles and shipments to parcel lockers this trend suggests that investors see an opportunity for unconventional lastmile services to complement companies with traditional delivery fleets as they anticipate the next normal in lastmile parcel delivery one unconventional startup is nuro which designs manufactures and operates delivery robots its r1 driverless delivery vehicles are being piloted in houston texas and scottsdale arizona through a partnership with kroger to deliver groceries for a fee the californiabased companys series b venture round brought in 940 million in february two thousand and nineteen and was led by softbanks vision fund another unconventional player the shenzhenbased hive box was established in two thousand and fifteen and now operates more than 150000 parcel lockers located across china together these receive more than nine million parcels per day five express companies including sf express have a stake in hive box the company raised 323 million in a series b round in january two thousand and eighteen and to date has received more than 700 million in funding freight platforms have also captured investor attention this holds especially true for platforms that focus primarily on road transportation which have received about 6 billion in funding while the vast majority of this sum comes from investment funds this segment has also seen the most corporate funding for example db schenker acquired a 25 million stake in the roadfreight booking platform uship roadfreight platforms enhance pricing transparency professionalize and digitize the often informally handled shipper–carrier exchange they focus on leveraging existing data as a means to address vast inefficiencies that still exist in the market for instance those caused by empty runs thus these startups significantly contribute to improving sustainability within the transport and logistics industries a trend that is becoming increasingly relevant they are extremely easy for truckers and others to use which improves the customer experience while roadfreight marketplaces and solutions have yet to capture large volumes they have challenged assetlight brokers and freight forwarders by matching shippers loads and carriers directly thus threatening to replace traditional intermediaries some incumbent players have already reacted to the emergence of roadfreight startups for instance dhl freight launched the online marketplace saloodo in 2016 and kuehne  nagel launched freightnet a roadfreight booking platform in 2014 freight platforms that focus on air and ocean transport have raised far less than their road transportation peers—about 16 billion flexport with its strong offering and prominent customer base clearly dominates this segment and accounts for 13 billion of this funding flexport recently announced a partnership with chinese delivery and logistics company sf express to provide complete freight services including full containerload ocean shipping and air cargo incumbents have also reacted in this segment for instance maersk launched its own digital forwarder twill in april 2017 the digital shipping platform initially focused on shipments between china and the united kingdom but quickly expanded and managed to reach twentyseven countries by the end of 2018 outside of mainland china asia has a high concentration of very wellfunded logistics startups especially in hong kong india and singapore lastmile startups entering the market with more traditional modes such as scooters vans and trucks are most successful in the asia–pacific region especially in india where players such as delhivery and xpressbees have built a completely new parcel network and collected hundreds of millions in funding within a few years these developments show that the traditional parcel players offerings have not sufficiently addressed these markets although logistics incumbents are not going anywhere the question remains how disruptive will these startups turn out to be the good news for the traditional logistics providers is that the network assets and relationships of incumbents are not going to be disrupted over the short term at least not in their major markets currently no new entrant has enough control over its network to ensure globally integrated seamless transportation on behalf of a large shipper—a capability that kuehne  nagel or dhl global forwarding consider their domain at the same time startups have conquered markets where incumbents had a weak offering to prevent new entrants from capturing the second wave of growth segments and keep other customers from insourcing incumbents must review their global presence and customer satisfaction across service segments they should also focus on new customer requirements such as increased sustainability and map these within the most promising growth segments overarching partnerships will be increasingly important to succeed in the future especially since processes in the industry are so intertwined connecting startups with incumbents can unlock substantial opportunities for all stakeholders incumbents have the opportunity to learn from young companies and deploy digital capabilities to link their physical network with customers startups get to improve their credibility and brand awareness as well as gain access to customers incumbents can benefit by learning how to become more agile getting new ideas and helping their brand be perceived as dynamic and digital our full report explores geographic

discusses how research on high levels of employment affects the spread of influenza and other viruses transmitted via dropletspread such as sarscov2 the results show that the high levels of employment in the us encourages the spread of influenza especially when employment in service sectors are high our results provide support for social distancing measures aimed to slow the growth of cases of covid19 many of the characteristics or environments associated with modern daily work life may encourage the transmission of viruses including seasonal influenza the flu and the novel coronavirus sarscov2 the cause of covid19 these characteristics include commuting via public transportation working in climate controlled indoor offices sharing workspaces and placing young children in daycare if the features of the working environment promote the spread of the flu and other viruses then being out of the labour force and away from these environments could help reduce the spread of diseases this is the premise behind the current public health policies of closing down public places and requiring social distancing early evidence suggests that these social distancing measures may be reducing the spread of sarscov2 eg dave et al 2020 friedson et al 2020 courtemanche et al 2020 baldwin and weder di mauro 2020 however because the covid19 pandemic is so recent much of this evidence is based on only a few months of data more evidence surrounding the effects of social distancing on the spread of sarscov2 could be gathered by studying the spread of similar viruses namely the flu evidence that high levels of employment are associated with high rates of seasonal flu in a recently published article markowitz et al 2019 we examine the relationship between economic activity as measured by employment levels and the spread of the flu in the us we use statelevel monthly employment rates from the bureau of labor statistics and statelevel monthly estimates of flu activity from the centers for disease control and prevention spanning the 20102011 flu season up to the 20162017 flu season our basic empirical strategy is to predict flu activity in a state and month as a function of the states employment levels in the previous month as well as temperature and precipitation and the previous months flu rate if our hypothesis is correct we should expect that increases in employment in jobs with higher levels of interpersonal contact should be more related to the spread of the flu thus we construct a measure of interpersonal contact levels for each industry sector using data from onet and construct employment measures at the industry level using data from the bls current employment statistics ces data set we find that the two sectors with the highest levels of interpersonal contact are the retail and healthcare sectors while the sectors with the lowest level of interpersonal contact are the construction and manufacturing sectors figure one summarise the results from our regression models we plot the increases in flu prevalence from an average monthly increase in overall employment and employment in sectors with high and low measures of interpersonal contact we find a strong positive association between employment and the spread of the flu and the results suggest that an average monthly change in overall employment about 033 percentage points increases flu prevalence by about 6 we find that employment changes in the retail and healthcare sectors the two sectors with the highest levels of interpersonal contact drive the aggregate results the same average monthly increase in retail employment and healthcare employment would lead to much larger expected increases in flu prevalence of between 20 and 30 respectively moreover we find that employment changes in the construction sector one of the sectors with the lowest level of interpersonal contact is not associated with statistically significant changes in flu prevalence interestingly changes in manufacturing employment lead to a large but extremely imprecisely measured increase in flu prevalence this may be due to underlying heterogeneity in how different types of manufacturing employment either aid or are not related to the spread of the flu we believe this remains an interesting question for future research figure one percent changes in flu prevalence from an average monthly increase in employment these results are relevant for several reasons first barring major economic shocks employment conditions can be forecast to a fairly accurate degree several months in advance this information could be used by the public health community to plan for the severity of an upcoming flu season for example the 20172018 flu season was particularly severe hospitals found themselves unprepared and struggling to keep up with the influx of patients as we have recently learned the ability to predict the potential severity of future communicable diseases is vital information for hospitals and public health officials in general if the economy is on an upswing the public health community should plan for an above normal increase in such diseases the reverse will hold as well this same logic can reasonably be applied to other dropletspread respiratory diseases like covid19 furthermore our results imply that employment in service industries – particularly retail and healthcare – is a particularly strong mechanism for flu spread if our economy continues to shift to more serviceoriented employment the results presented here suggest there is greater potential for virus spread in the future the statistically insignificant findings for industries such as construction with relatively low levels of interpersonal contact support the continuation of construction and infrastructure projects during periods of social distancing likewise restrictions on retail business and nonessential medical visits are prudent considerations as our results suggest activity in these industries is a significant source of viral infection lastly employers should consider differences in the lost productivity from many employees becoming infected with viruses versus the lost productivity from a few infected individuals taking sick leave workers concerned about missing pay or losing their jobs as the result of staying home from work due to illness will be less likely to heed early signs of influenza or other viral infections and stay home since a person may be infectious while experiencing mild symptoms this greatly increases the probability that the virus will spread to other workers in the firm this implies that firms should consider more generous ‘sick day policies particularly during the flu season a recent working paper pichler et al 2020 and a

ireland international eager to help fc cologne face wolfsburg in relegation battle|having spent several weeks holed up in isolation in germany republic of ireland international amber barrett is eager to help fc cologne reignite their battle against relegation when action in the frauenbundesliga resumes on friday with france spain and england having aborted the rest of the season for their respective womens leagues after the stoppage caused by the coronavirus pandemic the resumption of the frauenbundesliga and possible return of the champions league is all that remains in the toplevel womens soccer calendar in europe “germany has been a little bit different to the other countries i think theyve handled it a lot better” barrett told reuters in a telephone interview referring to the significantly lower number of covid19 related deaths that have occurred in the country “they were on top of it controlling the spread of the virus straight away and that obviously has helped “of course the most important thing is that everyone wants to play but you never want to put yourself in a situation where theres a threat to your health” after the 24yearold striker returned from international duty to cologne in early march the country entered a strict lockdown the following day since then she has kept fit by running doing weights and occasionally playing football tennis with a teammate “we had to maintain our fitness because we didnt know when we were going to get the call to say we were going back and in fairness everybody in the team did their bit” said barrett whose side will take on leaders wolfsburg in their first game back germanys lockdown strategy appears to have paid off as the mens bundesliga is the only major european league that has resumed its season albeit without fans in attendance while the remainder of frances ligue one season has been scratched other leagues around europe are still weighing up options on when to return with two teams set to be relegated from the frauenbundesliga cologne are secondfrombottom with seven points two behind 10thplaced msv duisburg but with a game in hand leaders wolfsburg have dropped only two points in sixteen games so far this season with fortysix points they are eight ahead of secondplaced bayern munich despite facing the runaway leaders in their first game back barrett remained undaunted “we couldnt have restarted against more difficult opposition but we just have to turn up on the day and make it difficult for them and hopefully ill get one little chance at the end of the game to win it for us” she said|2020-05-28|0.8874|positive|0.022500000000000013|positive

work via four shocks massive job losses massive digital transformations massive debt burdens and massive costs of socially distanced office space these matter in two ways first due to sunk cost hysteresis rehiring workers is very different than retaining workers second the digital transformations officespace costs and debt burdens will push firms to replace domestic workers with ‘telemigrants or ‘whitecollar robots the jobs that return will be those that require facetoface interactions and involve tasks that ai cannot handle things have changed so much with covid19 that not even the future is what it used to be – or so it seems from all the predictions that analysts are making about the postcovid world but why should things change permanently things are the way they are for good reasons if the reasons dont change permanently the outcomes wont change permanently actually it is more complicated than that some socioeconomicpolitical outcomes are governed by what might be called ‘rubberband dynamics others by ‘paperclip dynamics • when you shock a rubber band – say pull on it – the shape deforms but the shape returns when you stop pulling temporary shocks have temporary effects most economic phenomena are like this – the standard supplyanddemand mechanism for instance • when you pull on a paper clip it deforms but the shape doesnt return when you stop pulling temporary shocks have permanent effects technically the two types of dynamics are called nonhysteretic rubber band and hysteretic paper clip when thinking about how the covid shock will change the future we must focus on hysteretic processes generally speaking hysteresis happens in systems where the level of some capital stock alters marginal costs or benefits here ‘capital includes simple versions like human physical and knowledge capital or more complex forms like organisational capital social trust aspirations and expectations different sources of hysteresis work with different types of shocks covid19 has profoundly shocked the economy in many ways four are particularly pertinent to the future of work • an epic number of people have lost their jobs in america the figure is almost forty million in europe fewer have been laid off but millions have been dislodged from their usual employment relationships boeri et al 2020 many of these separations will last for a few quarters at least this matters due to sunk costs a firms decision to hire a worker is very different than its decision to retain a worker and thats why employment is a hysteretic process the firings also matter since they boost the attractiveness of officeplace automation – what i call ‘white collar robots in my two thousand and nineteen book the globotics upheaval automating servicetasks with for example robotic process automation rpa systems chatbots virtual assistants or higherend aisystems is easier when youve already laid off the workers they are replacing • a large share of workers in europe and america have learned to work remotely estimates are that from 4070 of workers in the us and europe worked from home due to the pandemic berg et al 2020 dingel and nieman 2020 brehan 2020 to make this possible firms have invested in digital transformations – especially in the service sector companies have invested in hardware and bandwidth workers have learned how to use collaborative software access remote databases and participate in virtual meetings managers have learned how to manage virtual teams this matters since the human physical and organisational investments are not going away and anything that makes it easier to telework domestically also makes it easier to telework internationally what i called ‘telemigration in my book now that telework is feasible for a hefty slice of their workforce firms will soon realise that they can get some of the remote work done at much lower cost by hiring workers sitting in lowwage countries while it is certainly true that foreign talent working online is unlikely to be as good as domestic talent working in the office the foreign talent may be a whole lot cheaper this is just servicesector globalisation so the deeper point is covidlinked changes are lowering the technical barriers to this type of globalisation • office space in europe and america got more expensive due to social distancing and other anticontagion requirements this wont last forever but it is likely to be true during much of the recovery phase this matters since firms will face the costraising aspects while they are deciding whether to rehire workers inhouse to sink the costs of outsourcing the jobs domestically or internationally or to automate the positions using whitecollar robots • corporate and government balance sheets have already been hit hard by the covid concussion more red ink is predicted for many quarters to come this matters since firms will be under pressure to cut costs in the short and medium term using ‘remote intelligence ri like telemigrants and artificial intelligence ai like whitecollar robots will be one way of reducing expenses the postcovid employment landscape what cant ri and ai do as the world returns to normal private and public employers will have to decide which sorts of workers they want and how many of them – starting from something of a tabula rasa some may decide to just go back to doing things the old way but on the margin the investment in remote work capacity will surely result in fewer workers in offices so what jobs wont be replaced by ri or ai applying the logic i developed in the globotics upheaval the jobs that will return are those that are intensive in the sorts of tasks that 1 cant be done remotely and 2 cant be done by whitecollar robots in other words the way to think about the future of work postcoivd19 is to use a process of elimination the question then is what cant ri and ai do i have a couple of chapters on this in my book but heres the gist as it turns out humans have unique advantages over whitecollar robots in things like judgement empathy intuition creativity ethics curiosity and comprehension of complex interactions among teams of humans psychologist call this ‘social cognition and we have it for very specific very deepseated reasons michael tomasellos book the cultural origin of human cognition asserts that social cognition allowed humans to live in large groups where survival turned on the ability of individuals to cooperate in a complex web of relationships involving trust kinship and dominance the equipment for this is hardwired into the human brain machine learning has problems with social cognition as i point out at length in my book first even todays computers arent powerful enough given the combinatoric aspects of social interactions second we dont have the right kind of data to train the whitecollar robots third machine learning techniques are a shallow imitation of the biology of human learning so it may be that a whole new computerscience approach is needed if machines are to rival humans in the most human skills lake et al 2017 what kind of jobs cant be done by telemigrants clearly work that requires local or culturespecific knowledge will be hard to do from overseas more generally the key is to think hard about why facetoface communication matters since verbal communication is almost costless these days a good place to start is nonverbal communication – a topic that is widely studied by psychologists when people are facetoface in the same room psychological experiments suggest that less than 30 of the information exchanged stems from the words spoken – some communication researchers put the number as low as 7 the rest is nonverbal one clear upshot of this is that forming trust is much easier with facetoface communication since it is easier to lie with words than it is to lie facetoface this is exactly why we trust people more when they say things straight to our face almost ten years ago alan blinder classified jobs according to offshoreability finding that something like 40 could be done remotely the sectors where less than 20 of the jobs were offshorable – that is could be done by telemigrants – were mostly of the havetobethere type jobs in hotels and restaurants transportation and warehousing construction leisure industries education and health and social care the most vulnerable sectors to telemigrants were professional scientific and technical sectors and the finance industry and media sectors more recently dingel and neiman 2020 came up with the figure that 37 of us jobs could be done remotely most servicesector and professional jobs have been sheltered from globalisation ie remote intelligence and whitecollar robots ie artificial intelligence since facetoface interactions were important and computers couldnt think that has been changing progressively as digital technology has advanced pushed by covid19 firms and workers have invested in say ten years worth of digital transformation in just a few months my guess is that this will accelerate the trend towards more service sector jobs coming into competition with ‘globotics ie telemigrants working in our offices while sitting abroad the globalisation part and software robots replacing particular officetasks the robotics part the jobs that survive competition from telemigrants will be those that require facetoface interactions the jobs that survive competition from whitecollar robots will be those that stress humanitys great advantages baldwin r 1986

auckland council leaves no area unscathed as it makes large scale cuts to bridge a 525million gap caused by impact of covid19|strikers gathered in aotea square for a rally and march down queen street auckland as a call for action on climate change auckland council proposes major cuts across the board including to climate change action scaling back services jobs and access to some facilities in the face of a 525 million budget hit due to covid19 few areas of the council operations are spared with proposed cuts to some public transport services the electrification of the bus fleet and community spending as the council faces going into deficit for the first time in its 10year history in a second threeweek round of public consultation on the hastily reshaped budget the council said cuts would be deeper if aucklanders opted for the lowerthanplanned option of a 25 per cent rate rise the council said operating costs would have to be cut by a further 54 million under a 35 per cent rates rise or by 75 million under the lower 25 per cent option read more  coronavirus auckland mayor says pay cuts and freezes only one part of budget squeeze  coronavirus aucklands greatest challenge is still to come  coronavirus auckland council predicts half billiondollar hit to finances both packages will result in noticeable changes to what we are providing to the community and to the level of staff we employ it said in the public consultation document just released other moves to keep the books as close to balanced as possible include the sale of 200 million of unspecified assets likely to be nonstrategic or surplus property the council said it was juggling the need to cut spending with unexpected costs it will face a current example is the drought situation for which watercare may need to soon invest 50 million to 180 million in critical water supply infrastructure it said transportrelated revenue is expected to be down by 113 million and part of the gap could be closed by a four per cent public transport fare rise in february one of the biggestever by auckland transport there will be 37 million transport operating budget cut across staffing contractors and cuts to the frequency and level of some services unusually an oftensuggested move charging for some park and ride car parks would occur only if a lower 25 per cent rate rise was implemented transport spending being cut or put back includes road safety improvements redlight camera rollouts at intersections and all cycling and walking projects not yet in construction the alreadycriticised slow roll out of electric buses will be further delayed with only three to be added on the puhinuiairport route this year a post covid19 construction slowdown is expected to show up as a twentyfive per cent  thirtyfive per cent reduction in the number of building and resource consents resulting in a 50 million drop in revenue cuts in staff numbers and costs and internal efficiencies in the environmental services waste services and regulatory services departments is expected to save 343 million staff cuts and other savings in the parks and community area is due to save 649 million mayor phil goff said none of the proposed budget cuts were easy to make there was nothing in the budget before covid19 that was frivolous or superfluous so everything that has been cut was important he told stuff the development agency panuku would have to cut its running costs by 3 million and slowing down city centre and local centre developments would save 24 million big cuts include deferring 162 million of capital works in the water and wastewater area most upgrades and replacements of community buildings and playgrounds is frozen and under a 25 per cent rate rise scenario some lesserused facilities would close permanently there will be fewer and smaller councilbacked events such as matariki waitangi ki manukau movies in parks music in parks and the heritage festival goff held out hope that some funding may flow from the governments various covid19 responses such as helping to fund shovel ready projects but that was still unknown i cant say that anything we are having to defer for a year is something we did not need he said despite the cuts the council was still proposing capital expenditure of 23 billion while lower than the previously planned 27b it was far higher than the fiveyear average of 16b aucklanders have until friday june nineteen to have their say on the reduced council budget|2020-05-29|-0.8573|negative|0.024032738095238093|positive
request for €20 rise during crisis from forty organisations is rejected|the department of employment affairs and social protection has said it will not increase the daily expenses allowance for asylum seekers following a request for the weekly payment to be temporarily increased by €20 during the covid19 pandemic more than forty organisations legal professionals and academics working with asylum seekers in ireland wrote to the minister for employment and social protection regina doherty in early may asking for additional financial support for people in direct provision during the health crisis the group expressed concern that people seeking protection were not entitled to the states short term covid19 financial support and that they remained “exceptionally vulnerable” during the crisis many asylum seekers are facing additional costs including increased spending on children who would normally be at school cleaning items medicine and food said the letter to the minister many direct provision residents who would usually use free wifi in libraries are spending more money on mobile data to access public health guidance online it added the letter also urged the department to reconsider its decision not to make the covid19 pandemic unemployment payment pup available to people in direct provision while some asylum seekers who lost work because of the coronavirus initially received the state support measure payments to people living in direct provision stopped after a couple of weeks and residents were put back on the €3880 weekly allowance €15520 per month for adults in the asylum system children in direct provision receive €2980 each week in a letter dated may 15th and seen by the irish times ms doherty responded that there were no plans to reinstate the covid19 payment to asylum seekers in direct provision who had lost work any increases to the rate of the daily expenses allowance would have to be approved by government and “considered in a budgetary context” she said protection applicants living in direct provision receive food accommodation and other services as well as the weekly allowance while the pup is paid to “people who in most cases have no other source of income” said ms doherty in the letter asylum seekers living outside direct provision are eligible for pup she added the minister noted that under measures introduced in response to the pandemic asylum seekers could stay with friends or family on a temporary basis while retaining their place within the accommodation system and continuing to receive the weekly stipend asylum seekers can also access exceptional needs payments with payments made at the discretion of officers administering the scheme she said any asylum seeker who requires financial assistance should contact the community welfare service that deals with their accommodation centre added the minister irish refugee council director nick henderson said he was disappointed by the ministers response and that the group would continue to campaign for the increased financial support an additional €20 per week would enable direct provision residents to buy extra hand sanitiser face masks phone data or home schooling tools said mr henderson “rejecting this request on the grounds that it is a budgetary matter and would need to be approved by government ignores the seismic changes that have already been made to this years budget” he said “increasing the allowance by this amount would go some way in showing we truly are all in this together”|2020-05-29|0.786|positive|0.09097222222222225|positive

become a longterm replacement for the classroom or lecture hall is anathema to most in education also worrying is the possibility that those in charge of thirdeducation institutions even more starved of resources than they were before covid19 will see remote or “blended” teaching as a new cheaper streamlined way of delivering “output” rendering the university campus almost redundant arising out of the current crisis there is a danger of a whole new language around online educational “provision” being added to the layer of corporate management speak that has long pervaded the irish education system in 2015 a senior ucd administrator sent this message to the university staff “strategic initiative six is concerned with consolidating and supporting efforts across our community to enhance agility and effectiveness in university process improvement thereby continuously furthering value for the ucd community and process beneficiaries whilst simultaneously empowering faculty and staff to proactively engage in continuous process improvement initiatives” those with a high pain threshold can reread that “sentence” several times but it will remain what it is a grotesque subversion of the notion of a thirdlevel community this jargon is a product of a trend historian tom dunne had written about two years earlier “like a deadly odourless gas the elements of a quiet revolution have seeped through every area of irish education during recent years poisoning the atmosphere    a relentless application of market principles    has shifted the focus of education from the development of the individual and the benefits flowing from this to society to the service of the economy narrowly conceived” this took on added pace in the aftermath of the last economic collapse with an insistence that “applied research” needed to be the main priority teachers were increasingly seen as “service providers” the students as “service users” and the university leaders and reams of bureaucrats as “managers” the casualisation of academic labour and shortterm contracts further embedded an insecurity that is the antithesis of an academic “community” and hinders creativity there has also been a preoccupation with what is offensively labelled “performance for growth” by university management as if the educators were stocks and shares parallel to this are obsessions with “impact” “globalisation” and ensuring a flow of money from china recently ucd management sought to change the universitys policy on academic freedom to allow for “different interpretations” of the concept due to its links with china the idea being that if ucd continues to “strengthen its international engagement” and partnerships with other universities overseas it should seek to accommodate “divergent approaches to academic freedom” after a backlash the proposed changes were withdrawn when i was an undergraduate the president of ucd was a philosopher the chances of such an appointment today are negligible how oldfashioned it appears now to strive for a university that is a pleasant place in which to work and study with pride in its selfmade identity and producing independent thinkers who can conserve create and transmit knowledge there is an onus on those in humanities – as in other areas – to effectively communicate the public value of their research the university is supposed to be a public good and those in it have responsibilities as public servants but so do those administering education and now is the time to think about that from midmarch educators responded to an emergency as best they could by switching everything online to get the academic year over the line and that seemed to be the overwhelming priority in the same way the discourse about this years leaving cert students seemed to be solely about the exams and what course place might come after relegating discussion of the problems in the system as it stands with or without covid19 a higher education authority report of two thousand and eighteen highlighted that one in six thirdlevel students drops out of their course during their first year and as pointed out by brian mooney this week that figure is likely to increase due to the panic and uncertainty prevalent this year for those hoping to go on to third level an acceptance or worse still embracing of remote teaching as the norm can only exacerbate that problem students need to learn and thrive through direct engagement not only with their course material but also with their lecturers and fellow students it is not more technology and regularising of remoteness that is needed coming out of this crisis it is imperative that our universities are properly funded but we do not need a new obsession with what i saw this week described as “crisisdriven innovation adaptation through technology” the danger is that this will further entrench the notion of “delivering” rather than teaching|2020-05-29|0.921|positive|0.07326745718050066|positive
to navigate pandemic tradeoffs policymakers need syntheses|economists like researchers in many disciplines are responding to the urgency of the covid19 pandemic the immediate priorities are understanding the consequences of the crisis for public finances and international trade scholars are scrambling to collect data on how many jobs are lost what people can afford to buy and what shortages will emerge even constructing basic economic statistics such as inflation and gross domestic product is challenging when onethird say of activity in the economy has halted do we count a furloughed person as in work what comprises a standard basket of goods when no one is going shopping we need these measures to understand which groups of people will be intolerably affected so that governments can direct help to them thats hard to do when standard metrics are having to be rebuilt on the fly there are many other pressing questions when will the health toll of isolation unemployment or delayed surgery outweigh that caused directly by covid19 what are the implications for next years supplies of staple foods or of higher levels of longterm disability how quickly can vaccine manufacture be scaled up what releasefromlockdown strategies are behaviourally and hence politically feasible can national governments negotiate with each other to arrive at cooperative mutually beneficial policies what can international agencies do to encourage this when geopolitical tensions are rising addressing these questions requires collaboration across many disciplines to synthesize new findings with old — fast its time to deliver on the benefits of public investment in research to set coronavirus policy model lives and livelihoods in lockstep the courage to step cautiously into other domains must be welcomed economists are notoriously less likely than other social scientists to look outside their own discipline and medical and natural scientists are not accustomed to looking to the social sciences for insight the pandemic is changing all that it has become obvious that the search for viable exit strategies needs biomedical science epidemiology public health behavioural and social psychology engineering economics law ethics international relations and political science without contributions from all these navigating toward lessthandisastrous outcomes for wellbeing — human and planetary — will be impossible we economists bring essential insight namely our habit of thinking about how to improve the terms of unavoidable tradeoffs every action even inaction has an opportunity cost how can that be minimized and what are the distributional consequences these as much as medical factors determine political and policy choices there is still a tendency to suggest a facile tradeoff between lives and livelihoods to be clear whatever lockdown policies governments impose or not the pandemic will have a devastating economic impact every nation is groping for an approach that will save lives mitigate the economic harm and prove feasible this is not simple and there is much we do not know across all fronts to share findings fast the economics community has set up lighttouch peerreview outlets such as the european economic associations covid19 resource the united kingdoms economic and social research council esrc is kickstarting an observatory to collate and translate research funders such as the esrc and the european commissions corona platform are rapidly processing research proposals academics who have long studied what previously seemed like niche topics such as the links between financial uncertainty and stress or knots in supply chains are producing research at extraordinary pace and providing public commentary to communicate their work but for any fruits of all this discovery to be a guide to policy they must be used i am concerned that government ministers and officials are having to judge for themselves — at a time when they are massively overstretched and under pressure — how to combine insights from various disciplines some covid19 advisory groups such as that of the uk government have too narrow a range of experience excellent as the individual members might be this challenge like other global challenges looming is the moment for the research community to prioritize synthesizing knowledge coronavirus and covid19 keep up to date sadly academic incentives work against people who are brave enough to cross into another disciplines territory career funding and publishing structures reward research into small narrow questions when the world has big complex problems forbidding argot is prized accessibility is viewed with suspicion universities research institutes and laboratories are condemning themselves to irrelevance in future — and worse now — if they do not break the shackles of departments and disciplines and reward academics for policy relevance as well as for basic research this requires institutional reform which is never easy and too slow for this crisis highprofile funders such as wellcome or the gates foundation as well as those in the public sector could make a powerful point by insisting that programmes integrate disciplines getting good at interdisciplinarity will pay dividends longterm the specifics will vary but the need for coordinated research and policy applies to building a postpandemic social order and to crafting a netzero economy that limits climate change as far as possible|2020-05-29|0.9408|positive|0.05496289424860853|positive

a study that suggested treatment with the malaria drug could be dangerous to people with coronavirus has slowed clinical trials — but the study itself has also been questioned|a study suggesting that the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is dangerous to people with severe cases of covid19 is sowing confusion among researchers — and halting clinical trials that are crucial to finding out whether the medication is effective at treating people infected with the novel coronavirus in light of the study this week the world health organization who has paused enrolment in its trial of the drug as a treatment for covid19 as have regulators in the united kingdom france and australia where similar trials are under way but the picture isnt clearcut on twentyeight may one hundred and twenty researchers signed a letter to the lancet which published the study1 highlighting concerns about the quality of the data and its analysis hydroxychloroquine has had a controversial history during the pandemic with politicians such as us president donald trump endorsing the medication which is cheap and easy to administer as a treatment despite scant evidence that it works researchers have been eagerly awaiting results from clinical trials to yield a clear answer but now they fear that the lancet study and the negative press coverage that followed might dissuade patients from joining the trials which would make it even harder to determine whether the drug works against covid19 “theres so much swirling around it people wont want to enter those trials” says david smith an infectiousdisease specialist at the university of california in san diego “in which case it will be an open question that wont get answered” coronavirus and covid19 keep up to date there is currently only one treatment that has shown promise against covid19 in a rigorous clinical trial and that drug remdesivir is in short supply and must be administered intravenously over several days typically in a hospital in the early days of the pandemic which has now killed more than 350000 people many were hopeful that hydroxychloroquine a relatively cheap and widely available drug might offer some benefits early laboratory studies suggested that the drug as well as a similar medicine named chloroquine might interfere with replication of the coronavirus but trials in humans have been inconclusive so far in the meantime advocacy by politicians such as trump — who has not only endorsed hydroxychloroquines use but said that he has taken it prophylactically — has muddied public perception of the drug “some people come in and say ‘the president takes it i need to take it” says smith “and others say ‘the presidents taking it im definitely not taking it” researchers have been waiting for results from a number of randomized controlled clinical trials testing hydroxychloroquine as a covid19 treatment the lancet study was not based on such trials instead it was an observational study cataloguing the effects of hydroxychloroquine in about 96000 patients hospitalized with covid19 around the world the study found the drug had no benefit and instead found a worryingly higher mortality rate among those who received it 18 compared with 9 in those who did not data from observational studies can be useful to get a sense of how a drug performs outside the confines of a clinical trial in which patients are often more carefully selected for treatment and monitored than in the real world but observational studies can also be prone to realworld bias one concern for example is that physicians might be more likely to give a drug to patients who are sicker and more likely to die nevertheless the results have led regulators and clinicaltrial sponsors to take action the who has paused enrolment in the hydroxychloroquine treatment group of its large solidarity trial an effort in thirtyfive countries to test potential covid19 therapies that is also testing three other potential covid19 treatments the uk medicines and healthcare regulatory agency mhra has similarly paused most of the countrys hydroxychloroquine trials for covid19 pending further safety assessments and in france where clinicaltrial enrolment has been halted doctors have been forbidden to prescribe the drug outside of clinical trials to people with covid19 the lancet studys lead author mandeep mehra a cardiologist at brigham and womens hospital in boston massachusetts says that he agrees with the whos decision to take a hard look at the safety data from the solidarity trial but he does not support ending clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine altogether “we never called for halting clinical trials” he says “in fact we called for the opposite” chloroquine hype is derailing the search for coronavirus treatments some of these impacts on clinical trials might not be permanent says cardiologist joseph cheriyan of the university of cambridge uk enrolments in clinical trials might resume after regulators have been assured that the data from these trials do not indicate that participants are being harmed by hydroxychloroquine within a day of the lancet papers publication the uks recovery trial which has enrolled 10000 patients to test six potential covid19 treatments consulted its safety board the board analysed the trials interim data and found no sign of harm to study participants from hydroxychloroquine as a result the trial can continue enrolling other trials might be able to continue recruiting if safety measures are adopted but some researchers have found that these can end a clinical trial in march rheumatologist jon giles at columbia university in new york city launched a trial determine whether hydroxychloroquine could lessen infection risk within households in which a member had contracted covid19 but on twentyfour april the us food and drug administration issued a warning about the effects of hydroxychloroquine on the heart and the ethics committee overseeing giless trial demanded that potential participants have an electrocardiogram first giless team didnt think it was safe to send people to a doctors office in the middle of a pandemic to have the measurement taken “i had to shutter my trial” giles says at the moment hydroxychloroquine is nearly the only drug being evaluated in covid19 prevention studies such as giless trial says cheriyan who is also carrying out a prevention trial cheriyan worries that negative publicity surrounding hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized covid19 patients could affect enrolment in his trial among healthy people even though the studies suggesting possible harms from hydroxychloroquine which has been used for sixty years to treat other ailments were in people who were already sick or hospitalized with covid19 in the meantime researchers are racing against the clock as the initial waves of the pandemic begin to recede in many countries the pool of potential trial participants is drying up this some worry means that physicians will not have the medicines they need to better deal with subsequent surges of covid19 “if there is a second wave we need to be better prepared” says cheriyan “we cant let it affect us the way we have this time” how countries are using genomics to help avoid a second coronavirus wave in the midst of it all the lancet analysis itself has come under fire some researchers have pointed to oddities in the data such as smoking and obesity rates that were reported as nearly equal across all parts of the world studied in the analysis and because the work relied on proprietary data gathered from medical centres the raw data were not made available to other researchers following these criticisms mehras team tracked down some errors — the table reporting smoking and obesity rates for example erroneously listed modelled data rather than raw data the lancet will soon issue a correction mehra says but the errors did not affect the papers conclusions and the company that gathered the proprietary data surgisphere corporation of chicago illinois says that it will accept proposals from other researchers to analyse its data but some remain sceptical about the studys conclusion that hydroxychloroquine is a safety risk to some people with covid19 smith says that he and his collaborators have analysed the data that are available and concluded that patients who received hydroxychloroquine in the study were often sicker in the first place than those who did not daniel freilich of bassett medical center in cooperstown new york says that he has independently analysed the data and come to the same conclusion but mehra says that his team accounted for those differences and still found a small difference in mortality furthermore he says his study merely highlights an association between the treatment and increased death but because it is an observational study and not a clinical trial it cannot exclude the possibility that other factors may have contributed to that difference in mortality|2020-05-29|-0.8976|negative|0.07174115566972712|positive
abdelrahman y fouda shares six things he learnt from interviewing online|i am a postdoctoral researcher studying retinal diseases and was recently awarded a career transition grant to start my own lab my search for a faculty position was hit by the covid19 pandemic i started sending out applications in january 2020 and found out in march that my planned interviews across several us states coincided with campus closures the interviews were postponed indefinitely i reached out to four potential employers and we agreed to conduct online interviews conducting a fullday interview online was new both to me and to the interviewers but over the past eight weeks ive got lots of handson experience heres what i learnt coronavirus and covid19 keep up to date ask for an itinerary just as with an inperson interview its important to have a sense of what your day is going to look like i made sure i knew who i would be meeting and what they were planning to go over your potential employer will probably send a series of links to connect to the scheduled meetings i made sure i had room in my itinerary to disconnect reconnect and troubleshoot technical glitches between meetings i also scheduled breaks throughout the day and a long break for lunch to mentally disengage and stretch out in practice this meant i had five minutes between every ‘backtoback meeting plus 15minute breaks every couple of hours and an hour for lunch test the connection before the interviews i asked my potential employers what videoconferencing tool they were using and downloaded the program to my computer often there is a web version but in my experience the downloadable app tends to be more stable and come with more options i familiarized myself with it by setting up a call with a friend so i could explore the programs features and get input i also asked the meeting administrator for a test session a few days before the actual interview to make sure i could share my audio video and seminar slides properly set up your meeting room i was going to be sitting in the same spot for the whole interview so i made sure to choose a quiet welllit room as lockdowns ease you might be able to conduct the interview from your lab but if you are still at home ask those you live with to be quiet and respect your space for the day if you go into the office or are in a shared living space put a sign on the doorknob making it clear that you shouldnt be disturbed if you have children or pets that might make noise let your interviewers know ahead of time try not to let it worry you — were all getting used to background noises under lockdown and your interviewers are not going to judge you on your childrens ability to keep quiet in my case i headed into my lab following social distancing guidelines and informed my colleagues of the interview beforehand prepare your environment i was careful to adjust the camera to be at my eye level some meeting programs provide a virtual background or let you upload one from your desktop but i used the neutral wall in my lab because it felt more natural i also chose to face the door to anticipate any surprise entrances make sure you have what you need next to you such as your itinerary a pen and paper and your cv embrace murphys law ‘whatever can go wrong will go wrong in my case it was the wifi signal halfway into a seminar i had to move to another room to find an ethernet cable and continue my presentation it was disruptive but i hope the interviewers took it as a sign of resilience and working through unusual circumstances if its an option a backup technical plan and computer is a good idea dress up in an online interview you do not have personal interaction and therefore you want to give the best impression possible through your tiny computer camera i made sure i dressed as if i was going to meet my prospective employer in person professional attire has a positive impact and helped to remind me to behave in a polished manner — ive found it too easy to drop the professionalism in front of a webcam because you dont feel the same social pressure you might in a facetoface interview dress well from top to bottom and do not rely on the fact that the camera shows only your upper body you might need to stand up or walk with your laptop from one room to another as i did communicate clearly when i faced connection problems during my conversations and seminar i tried to explain in a calm and timely manner i had a mobile phone on hand and had exchanged numbers with the meeting administrator in case i needed to troubleshoot problems i tried to pause at appropriate points during my seminar to make sure everyone was following and connected in one of the sessions i was talking to two faculty members who could see me and each other but i could not see them owing to a software glitch i made sure to check they were still available and let them know that i could only hear them there were other clumsy moments — often it felt like a choice between interrupting an interviewer or letting dead silence fill the air for a moment in these moments i made sure to keep a big smile on my face and talked only after the other side had completely finished and paused for couple of seconds before i accept a job offer i hope i will eventually be able to visit the facilities and lab space inperson — an important consideration that cant be solved by videoconferencing but overall i found online interviewing much less tiring and stressful than onsite visits i had many more opportunities to rest outside individual meetings which i wouldnt have had in the ‘real world and i had none of the travel commitments that might have been burdensome before lockdown be prepared to be told that your potential employer will not be hiring until covid19 loosens its grip be patient positive and understanding remember that this is a difficult time for everyone — and your potential employers will probably do the same for you|2020-05-29|0.9984|positive|0.14006443747823058|positive

how the covid19 crisis can catalyze change across the continent|this article is a collaborative effort by kartik jayaram kevin leiby acha leke amandla ookoombaka and ying sunny sun representing views from across the mckinsey africa practice covid19 poses a grave threat to lives across africa with the world health organization who estimating that the continent could see up to 190000 deaths over the next year if the pandemic is not controlled in the face of this challenge governments have acted fast both to strengthen the capacity of health systems and to contain the spread of the virus as of may 19 about half of africas population lives in countries imposing some type of lockdown but despite accelerating case numbers and stilllow testing rates in many countries exhibit 1 as well as recent reports of a worsening health crisis in hotspots on the continent some governments have started to ease restrictions with caution as economic pain becomes more acute for households the economic outlook is also bleak globally while some countries are past their peak rate of infections concerns about virus resurgence continue to raise uncertainty in a recent mckinsey survey of global executives forty percent anticipated a muted economic recovery a prolonged global slowdown combined with continued lockdowns in africa could plunge the continent into its first economic recession in twentyfive years while threatening the jobs or incomes of one hundred and fifty million africans—onethird of the entire workforce african countries need to find smart approaches to reopen economies in a calibrated way that brings key industries back into operation while ensuring safe ways of working the covid19 crisis will likely persist for some time and there is serious risk of a resurgence in infections accordingly governments will need to build the capacity to alternate between reopening and restricting economies on a granular local level—akin to developing and flexing a muscle in the first part of this article we shine a spotlight on these approaches to smart reopening suggesting pathways that countries can adopt to save lives and safeguard livelihoods looking further ahead however we believe that the crisisdriven action currently underway contains the seeds of a largescale reimagination of africas economic structure servicedelivery systems and social contract the crisis is accelerating trends such as digitization market consolidation and regional cooperation and it is creating important new opportunities—for example to boost local manufacturing formalize small businesses and upgrade urban infrastructure just as businesses and governments take immediate steps to strengthen health systems and restart economies they also need to think ahead and plan for the continents “next normal” these changes and opportunities are the focus of the second part of this article which presents nine big ideas to reimagine africa to develop these ideas we reached out to more than twenty leading thinkers across africa and beyond—and asked them how the crisis could catalyze longterm change on the continent these interviews combined with mckinseys own analysis make it clear that a positive transformation is by no means inevitable a powerful collaborative effort will be required to ensure that africas “next normal” is characterized by inclusive development effective delivery and innovative approaches to solve the continents greatest challenges many african countries and cities have been under strict lockdown and other restrictions for over two months during this time economic pain has become more acute as countries across the continent start to reopen their economies governments face tough decisions on how best to manage this process in order to protect lives and safeguard livelihoods to date different countries have adopted varying approaches for example ghana has largely reopened its economy subject to physicaldistancing measures while south africa has taken a more cautious phased approach to reopening our analysis of reopening strategies globally and in africa suggests that governments can follow a threestep process in designing local response measures to release restrictions in a calibrated way tailored to their countries unique circumstances the first step is to define a tiered set of local response measures from the least restrictive to the most restrictive to be applied to regions across the country each tier would include measures to protect both the general population and highrisk populations the elderly and people who are immunocompromised and would also specify which sectors can open and operate depending on a countrys geographic diversity a number of tiers can be established south africa for example has implemented a fivetier system in a fourtier system the following measures might apply • tier one the least restrictive would entail no restrictions beyond physical distancing and would allow all sectors to operate • tier two could involve closure of schools and prohibition of mass gatherings while highrisk populations would be encouraged to stay at home a broad set of sectors would be allowed to operate such as construction mining manufacturing banking and retail—provided they can comply with health and safety protocols such as use of personal protective equipment ppe and temperature checks but sectors at high risk of transmission would be closed or restricted those might include education transport food services and entertainment • tier three could involve restrictions on travel between regions of the country for the general population and mandatory stayathome directives for the atrisk population a narrower set of sectors would be allowed to operate including agriculture and information and communication technology ict • tier four the most restrictive could entail a full lockdown on movement for the general population and quarantine encouraged for those at risk only essential sectors would be allowed to operate including health and public administration we suggest two tools that governments can apply in implementing a tiered system exhibit 2 the first is the population protection matrix which maps the measures governments can use both to protect the general population and to shield highrisk groups the second is the sector tiering matrix which can help guide decisions on which sectors of the economy can reopen under each tier taking into account both their inherent rate of contagion and their economic relevance exhibit 3 the second step is to “triage” regions or subregions across the country to determine which tier each of these geographic areas would fall into exhibit 4 the triage process would be dynamic and would incorporate new data as they emerge it would be based on two criteria • the severity of virus spread in a region a measure which takes into account the extent of ongoing transmissions as well as the severity of cases should there be high transmission • the readiness of the publichealth system in the region—both the ability of the system to test trace and isolate cases and contacts and its medical capacity to treat severe cases exhibit four shows how the regions of a country might be triaged into tiers based on these factors the yaxis covers the severity of virus spread considering both the daytoday growth in case counts as well as the clinical severity of cases as influenced by factors such as demographics and comorbidities in the population the readiness of the health system on the xaxis can be assessed using metrics such as availability of critical hospital supplies and criticalcare beds testing rates test positivity rates contacts traced successfully and confirmed covid19 cases isolated the third and ongoing step is to monitor progress continuously once regions are triaged and measures are implemented continuous assessments will be required to ensure that these measures are being adhered to governments would need to identify the triggers or thresholds for moving a region into a less restrictive tier—or a more restrictive one in this regard it is critical that decision making is factbased and datadriven with a constant focus on safeguarding both lives and livelihoods governments can guide efforts in three major areas to ensure that regions progress towards the lowest tier • scale up testing and tracing in addition to testing those with symptoms and their contacts more widespread testing should ideally extend to highrisk groups such as healthcare workers moreover tracing of potential covid19 cases would be needed in each region this may require rapid training of workers to locate and isolate one hundred percent of contacts of confirmed cases in a way that respects individuals privacy and safety • experiment with shielding for highrisk populations shielding highrisk populations amidst broader reopening can help protect lives governments can test and deploy different approaches—for example by providing support and incentives for the affected populations to stay at home or creating quarantine spaces directly within or adjacent to a community where highrisk groups are relocated temporarily to minimize contact with other residents while shielding has not been widely used globally it could be a more relevant tool for the african continent however implementation could be particularly challenging in a context where vulnerable older populations tend to live together with younger members of their family shielding would need to be communityled rather than centrally imposed governments could empower communities to design implement and manage shielding interventions and could provide the required financial and logistical resources required they could also allow communities to selfpolice shielding adherence including through social pressure and community influencing based on our calculations the cost of shielding would be significantly

following are un secretarygeneral antónio guterres remarks at the military gender advocate award and dag hammarskjöld medal ceremony in new york today|following are un secretarygeneral antónio guterres remarks at the military gender advocate award and dag hammarskjöld medal ceremony in new york today allow me to ask before i start for us all to have a minute of silence in memory of all those peacekeepers that have lost their lives protecting the lives of the people we care for today we mark the international day of united nations peacekeepers in a context that is entirely unique in our history the covid19 pandemic has changed almost everything we do — both here at headquarters and everywhere in the field moments ago i laid a wreath at the peacekeepers memorial to honour the more than 3900 women and men who have lost their lives since one thousand nine hundred and fortyeight while serving under the united nations flag in previous years hundreds of diplomats united nations staff and journalists joined me for this important moment i know that today they joined me in spirit the pandemic has required us to hold the ceremonies for the military gender advocate award and the dag hammarskjöld medal virtually but what the virus has not changed is the service sacrifice and selflessness of the more than 95000 women and men serving in thirteen peacekeeping operations around the world every day our peacekeepers continue to protect vulnerable local populations support dialogue and implement their mandates while fighting covid‑19 they are doing everything they can to be an integral part of the solution to this crisis while keeping themselves — and the communities they serve — safe as always they give the united nations family many reasons to be proud but the virus is not the only threat that our peacekeepers face hostile acts improvised explosive devices accidents and diseases continue to take a heavy toll today with the awarding of the dag hammarskjöld medal we pay tribute to the eightythree military police and civilian personnel from thirtynine countries who lost their lives last year serving in united nations peace operations unfortunately i also want to say that yesterday and today two of our military colleagues have passed away due to covid19 one peacekeeper from cambodia and the other from el salvador both members of the united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in mali minusma now in in honour of the memories of all those who have fallen in the line of duty i want to express me my deepest condolences to their families i hope that this medal offers them a measure of comfort i now ask all of you wherever you are to feel strongly the solidarity with those families that are also permanently in our memory in our attention because they were the ones who suffered more to get less with those fallen in the line of duty now this year as we mark the twentieth anniversary of security council resolution one thousand three hundred and twentyfive 2000 on women peace and security we are observing the international day of united nations peacekeepers with the theme “women in peacekeeping a key to peace” resolution one thousand three hundred and twentyfive 2000 was a milestone in recognizing that women have a right to full equal and meaningful participation in peace processes conflict resolution and peacebuilding it is also emphasized that women peacekeepers play an essential role for the success of our peace operations day by day women peacekeepers help improve all aspects of our operations and performance they ensure better access to local communities they prevent and reduce conflict and confrontation and they serve as role models for their peers and others in addition we have seen that our operations are better able to build trust with those in need of protection when their staffing reflects the communities in which they serve this is another reason why increasing the number of women in peacekeeping is so crucial peacekeeping is more effective for everyone when we have more women peacekeepers at all levels including in decisionmaking we will continue to do everything we can including with our troop and police contributors to reach this goal in that spirit since 2016 the military gender advocate award has recognized the dedication and efforts of individual military peacekeepers in promoting the principles of resolution one thousand three hundred and twentyfive 2000 in peace operations today i am proud to announce that two peacekeepers will receive the award jointly for their contribution to this cause commander carla monteiro de castro araujo of the brazilian navy who is deployed with the united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in the central african republic minusca and major suman gawani of the indian army a military observer formerly deployed with the united nations mission in south sudan unmiss commander monteiro de castro araujo serves as minuscas military gender and protection adviser in this role she has strengthened the missions ability to protect civilians address conflictrelated sexual violence and prevent sexual exploitation and abuse she also strived to improve the living conditions of her fellow women peacekeepers major gawani during her deployment in south sudan mentored more than two hundred and thirty military observers on conflictrelated sexual violence and ensured the presence of women military observers in each of the missions team sites she also trained the south sudanese government forces and

a new approach can help industrials gain greater visibility into performance and capture lasting gains|along with its severe human toll the spread of the coronavirus has exacerbated longstanding challenges in businesses worldwide for industrial companies—especially those with highmix lowvolume manufacturing—covid19 has increased the alreadywidespread problems with shopfloor productivity as supplychain disruptions affect shipment of critical parts industrials are struggling to meet their promised customer delivery dates within plants physicaldistancing requirements and line closures are disturbing some workflows these delays often prevent industrials from delivering critical products including sanitization tools and other equipment to help their customers both fight and recover from the pandemic for many years industrials have deployed lean levers and performancemanagement initiatives to improve productivity and expand margins they usually achieved good initial results but their gains frequently vanished or decreased as managers became distracted and employees returned to their old ways some industrials have also offshored production to reduce costs but then encountered substantial challenges and high startup costs when they tried to replicate their capabilities and skills in new locations with recent tariffs and travel disruptions creating unprecedented uncertainty more businesses are considering reshoring production to increase their resilience and flexibility in the “next normal” that makes manufacturing performance even more important a new approach to productivity—active performance management apm—may be more likely to deliver lasting gains than previous methods it focuses on three areas where most current solutions fall short realtime performance visibility daily performance planning and endtoend accountability when highmix lowvolume industrials incorporate apm into their standard workflows they typically improve productivity by thirty to fifty percent within eight to twelve weeks of deployment while simultaneously increasing ontime deliveries and unlocking additional capacity surprisingly many highmix lowvolume manufacturing operations lack realtime visibility into performance instead they review key performance indicators kpis weekly or even monthly this frequency may be enough to drive performance in highvolume environments where variability is low and processes are predictable but it is not well suited to the complexity of a highmix factory without realtime transparency supervisors are unlikely to discuss and address issues until their impact has snowballed for example one industrial appliance manufacturer with an assembly line that produced 4 million in product per month was accumulating nearly 1 million of additional backlog over the same period because it did not have robust solutions for tracking daily performance units would literally get lost and tucked away on a vast line and operators would step away from their stations and attempt to resolve issues rather than flagging or escalating them the number of partially completed units soared customers threatened to cancel orders and the company missed out on new business because its lead times were so high the apm approach takes a much more detailed view of production by breaking up each shift into two to threehour performance blocks exhibit 1 for each block the production target is generally a proportional amount of the endofshift goal the process for setting targets is described in the sidebar “building a laborcontent baseline” supervisors receive information about these blocks upon their completion enabling a nearrealtime view of performance they can then flag problems as they occur and identify root cases immediately before any issues escalate most important they can quickly act to get a shift back on track to target to prevent future issues information about all problems and root cases is logged in a database so supervisors can develop improvement initiatives and assign each one to an owner the owners are responsible for identifying and implementing a sustainable longterm solution over a short time frame—typically within twentyfour hours on a weekly basis plants can use the assembled data to conduct a more holistic analysis by looking at the largest loss drivers identifying different improvement strategies and selecting those that will produce the most benefit for each strategy improvement initiatives are developed a clear owner is engaged and completion progress is visibly displayed for all employees to see beyond generating a detailed look at each shift the apm approach provides insights into performance at the individualoperator level in addition to encouraging employees to strive for improvement this information helps supervisors to flag issues—such as slowdowns resulting from missing parts or tools quality issues requiring rework and difficulties that arise during challenging or unfamiliar processes—that typically get lost during a shift with the increased visibility area leads and supervisors can give operators the help they need to achieve their targets in turn operators feel that supervisors support them and recognize their concerns under apm all employees not just managers have complete visibility into performance many industrial manufacturing facilities initially place simple performance boards in each production area—basically large mounted whiteboards that are manually updated to show the actual work completed during each performance block as well as how much it varied from the target exhibit 2 eventually most facilities that adopt apm migrate to one of several digital tools for easier updating and clear cloudbased performance transparency downtime tracking and the identification and resolution of issues as with any tool manufacturing plants must ensure that trained onsite support is available allowing it to be used consistently the current manufacturing slowdown in which many plants operate at reduced capacity may be an ideal time for industrials to rethink their digital performancetracking solutions and experiment with new ones when we examined the impact of realtime performance tracking across a complex line at a highmix lowvolume industrial business we found that productivity rose eight percentage points exhibit 3 while lean levers were also beneficial they did not generate as much improvement on their own after this business undertook an endtoend operational transformation that emphasized realtime performance transparency across all lines overall productivity rose by thirtyfive percent in sixteen weeks the business also rapidly unearthed additional opportunities to improve the supply chain eliminate part shortages and simplify manufacturing during product design by pursuing these opportunities manufacturing operations increased product throughput by thirty percent without additional capital investment in equipment or facilities enabling business growth to achieve high performance in manufacturing companies need a rigorous approach to production planning at many industrials the sales and operationsplanning team sends daily targets and schedules to the shop floor rather than providing a week or monthlong plan well in advance its leaders usually take this approach because they lack digital scheduling tools underestimate the importance of planning or are so focused on daytoday customer needs that they have little time to think about the future while companies with minimal variation between products can rely on daily visibility of production needs highmix lowvolume industrials often encounter problems when they follow the same approach since their staffing requirements vary depending on how products are customized such companies will end up with either too many or too few employees if line assignments remain static supply bottlenecks—now more common because of covid19—may also require more frequent staffing adjustments because some lines lack the necessary inputs a second component of apm the performanceenvelope model addresses these problems exhibit 4 it provides a comprehensive view of efficiency targets and staffing requirements including the buffer required to account for unplanned events such as absenteeism part shortages and rework in this fourstep model supervisors first examine demand for the week ahead and the current backlog for a single production area using customer delivery dates and required stock levels as a guide this information is then analyzed and translated into essential output—both product type and quantity—for each production line after quantifying production requirements supervisors can create a staffing plan that maps the required labor across lines they can also apply analytics to adjust the production sequence when needed a model might for instance indicate where bottlenecks are most likely to occur as the product mix changes throughout a given day or week staff can then be proactively reallocated across stations to balance the line the model might also identify other efficiencyoptimizing tactics such as grouping similar units into a single production shift or flexing staffing across shifts or even hour by hour within a given shift the exact changes will depend on the product mix supervisors then repeat this process for each production area in a plant if conditions change—for instance when unexpected supply problems materialize—supervisors must request a variance before deviating from the plan the plants leadership will then determine whether to approve changes by considering various factors including production needs and the potential risks of delayed production or lower efficiency in some cases the leadership may ask supervisors to create a recovery plan or to provide additional support by taking various steps such as shifting underutilized capacity from other areas of the plant permitting a small amoun|2020-05-29|0.997|positive|0.12021823976548382|positive

opinion noone knows what lasting impact covid19 will have which means its time to listen|opinion the scale and pace of change today is extraordinary for years companies have been preparing for forces of disruption such as shifting regulations digitisation robotics and artificial intelligence ai but the sudden impact of covid19 a single force caught the world off guard when a fundamental challenge for companies is to predict when and where disruption is coming from covid19 arrived and managed to disrupt business models air travel supply chains and worklife balance around the world in less time than it takes to complete a 30day fitness challenge noone knows exactly what lasting impact covid19 will have on the economy and supply chains amongst other things but we are already seeing and living the societal changes that will undeniably have lasting impacts whether its moving more of our lives online new hygiene habits greater comfort with absenteeism a revived gratitude for the great outdoors a new form of nationalism as we hail our essential workers or simply a rekindled appreciation for plunger coffee the novel virus is already reorienting our relationship to the outside world and each other how quickly the new habits and awareness will recede if ever as the lockdown eases is uncertain and it will be different for different people but we need to acknowledge that many things that were once ignored have been overturned by necessity so we are destined for some permanent change read more  covid19 lockdown ignites kiwis entrepreneurial spirit  that light isnt the one at the end of the tunnel bank economists warn  punt on fresh vegetable delivery pays off for invercargill man during covid19 lockdown  build with wood – a boon for jobs and the environment amid all this change and uncertainty how can organisations best understand the new way of beingintheworld and doingintheworld to achieve lasting impact there are a myriad of perceptions floating around about the future of physical workspaces and business models as a result of the lockdown and working from home wfh while its important to understand what actions other companies are considering theres no ‘quick fix or ‘one size fits all response what we shouldnt do is leave it unattended and only assume that disruption will have a negative impact the best thing organisations can do is rediscover reopen the dialogue with their workforce and customer base to seek out opportunities at a time overcome with physical disconnection now more than ever is the time to listen everyones experience of being an employee during covid19 will be different weve seen organisations that were once opposed to the idea of working from home suddenly make it a top priority people are managing the competing roles of employee parent caregiver and teaching assistant others may have worked the whole lockdown at their place of work apprehensive as the rest ride it out in the safety of their home in times of adversity values and priorities shift and employees are sure to request changes this means organisations must relearn about their workforce using digital and interactive tools organisations can gather meaningful data and insight on workforce sentiment to recognise understand and anticipate change the insight will likely nod to things you already do well but also opportunities and things that you might need to learn from scratch employee surveys will provide you with immediate evidencebased insight which will help dispel old assumptions and help you understand your employees home working experience so what questions should you be asking if youre not asking the right questions youre at risk of diving into a treasure trove of statistics and statements and emerging with less than meaningful answers track what matters and that is your employees employees are the champions who underpin the success of your organisation now is the time to ensure their needs are front and centre so hone in on the experience if we could read minds we could in principle shape perfect experiences and keep experiences current but we cant what we can do is listen with qualitative surveys and polls this means rather than measuring how employees do their work from home delve into how employees feel about their work and newfound work environment and remote working practices as intangible and evolving as culture can be ask about it seek to understand employees sense of belonging purpose and connectedness when working remotely understand not only how employees are directing energy towards their tasks but towards colleagues collaborators and customers this feedback will help to discover what employees value what the obstacles and enablers are where there are opportunities for innovation and flexibility and even allude to the complementary aspects of office and home it goes without saying that you cannot measure everything but a suite of good metrics allows you to get a pretty good picture of what is actually happening and where opportunities lie above all else taking the initiative to ask for candid feedback shows leadership and solidarity during these challenging times to close the loop you must be prepared to act then the information needs to be used to take action just as you cant measure everything not every piece of feedback is going to prove that your intuition is right or offer straightforward solutions action can be as simple as sharing the findings with your employees or sending out a newsletter to answer common concerns if findings point toward larger changes theres the ability to rely on further research and workshops that are curated to unearthing practical solutions its hard to predict the precise effects but organisations should look for ways that empower them to be optimistic agile and prepared when disruption is so extensive and effects so unpredictable it is hard to differentiate setbacks from opportunities but we need to acknowledge that standards we used to live by have been overwritten and some may never apply again information is incredibly valuable and having more information is only a good thing having data will help make the uncertainty a bit more certain it will provide immediate robust insight to help you navigate through this challenging time and enable you to scale your efforts towards a changed and fresh future

the covid19 crisis has hit womens employment particularly hard partly because the worsthit sectors have high female employment shares but also because schools and daycare closures have forced more mothers to leave their jobs this column looks at germany…|the shortrun macro implications of school and childcare closures the covid19 crisis has hit womens employment particularly hard partly because the worsthit sectors have high female employment shares but also because schools and daycare closures have forced more mothers to leave their jobs this column looks at germany where 26 of the workforce has children aged fourteen or younger and quantifies the macroeconomic importance of working parents if schools and daycare centres remain closed as the economy slowly reopens 11 of workers and 8 of all working hours will be lost to the labour market policies to restart the economy must accommodate the concerns of these families economies around the world are facing massive job losses – numbers in many countries are approaching those of the great depression in the 1930s the unemployment rate in the us already reached 147 in april 2020 and realtime surveys put it as high as 24 during the week of 10–16 may bick and blandin 2020 unlike in normal business cycles where fluctuations in hours are driven largely by men doepke and tertilt 2016 the covid19 recession has hit the employment of women particularly hard – partly because sectors with high femaleemployment shares such as retail and tourism have been strongly affected but also because schools and daycare closures forced some mothers to leave their jobs alon et al 2020 torrejón et al 2020 germany has been impressively sheltered so far the unemployment rate in april two thousand and twenty stands at only 58 but employers rely massively on shortterm work among workers employed in january 13 are either on shortterm work or employed but not working as of twentyfour may blom et al 2020 while 28 of the workforce is working fully or partly from home we explore the labour market consequences of slowly ‘reopening the economy and increasing the demand for physical presence at the workplace assuming schools and childcare centres remain at least partly closed we first report what fraction of the workforce live with children in the household and then estimate what fraction of workers have to provide childcare if schools and childcare centres do not reopen to the extent the economy does we also estimate what fraction of total hours will be lost in the labour market and find that the macroeconomic impact due to parents inability to work is likely large we use data from the two thousand and eighteen european labour force survey and consider all individuals aged twenty and older for the labour force rather than relying on detailed microdata on childcare arrangements we follow dingel et al 2020 and estimate what percent of the workforce is affected by school and childcare closings based on precrisis data on employment hours and children across households we assume that children aged fourteen or younger cannot be left unsupervised alone at home while many behavioural responses can be expected after a large shock adjusting the presence of children in the household seems near impossible in the shortrun further most margins that working parents use in normal times such as hiring babysitters sharing childcare duties with neighbours and friends or relying on grandparents are currently either explicitly banned by state law or at least highly discouraged thus the most likely margin of adjustment to the closures is that one adult per household will stop working we start by looking at the share of employed workers with children aged fourteen or younger in their households figure one shows that a notable proportion of the german workforce have children one out of four employed workers 259 have children at home this number of workers is larger than the combined share of all workers in the german manufacturing and construction sector in two thousand and nineteen 228 figure one childcare obligations of the employed in germany comparing the first two bars in figure 1 we see that 4 of households with children also include a nonworking adult such as a nonworking mother an older sibling or grandparents assuming that these nonworking adults could take over childcare and homeschooling obligations we still find that one in five employees 212 are without childcare if school and childcare centres remain closed next we estimate the share of workers who will be unable to work due to childcare obligations assuming that one adult will stay home in each household this share of employed workers therefore corresponds roughly to half of the couple households plus the share of single households in total we estimate that about 11 of workers would have to stay at home with 9 of these workers living in couple households and 2 being single parents to put this number into perspective we compare it to the unemployment rate of 58 in april 2020 even if all unemployed workers in germany found work immediately this would just fill half the jobs potentially left vacant due to parents inability to work couples can and likely will optimise when choosing who will stay at home within each household with childcare obligations we identify the household member with the lowest regular hours of work and assume that this person will stay at home this results in a total 84 reduction of work hours of which 68 stem from workers in couple households and 16 from single parents within couple households we find that in 82 of households mothers work fewer hours than fathers thus the majority of hours lost to the labour market will likely be in femaledominated occupations table one reports the same numbers separately for children above and below the schoolentry age of 6 allowing us to separately assess work hours lost due to school closures and to daycare closures for example if schools reopen but daycare centres stay closed still 98 6335 of the employed are affected in that they have no caregiver in the household if instead daycare centres reopen but schools stay closed 15 11535 of the employed have a childcare problem to gauge the macroeconomic effects we compare the 84 lost hours to a popular policy instrument to deal with labour underutilisation namely shorttime work shorttime work programmes were prevalent during the global financial crisis and are also heavily used now in 2009 more than 11 million workers were on shorttime work with an hours reduction of about onethird of their working time 281 in other words during the global financial crisis 31 of all employed workers were on shorttime work and their hours reduction accounted for 1 of total hours worked in 20095 while these were massive programmes the numbers are dwarfed by parents likely reduction in work hours during the current crisis based on the numbers in table 1 we estimate that close to four times as many workers and more than eight times the share of hours would be lost due to parents inability to work due to childcare obligations even if we overestimate the share of affected hours – because some children can stay alone for some time some parents can work from home while simultaneously taking care of their children or some other childcare arrangements like sharing between families or involving grandparents are used – it is clear that the impact of the childcare and school closings on hours worked is large most of the reduction of hours will likely come from women from a macroeconomic perspective the labour supply of parents who would have to stay home if economic activity fully resumes but schools and childcare facilities remain closed is massive we estimate the share of affected employed workers to be close to twice the number of all unemployed workers in germany and their share in hours worked is eight times the work reduction due to shorttime work during the global financial crisis while we acknowledge that workers might find creative solutions to organise childcare to best deal with this situation the macroeconomic laboursupply effects are still so large that policy seems well advised to take parents labourmarket situation into account when developing plans for restarting the economy while this column focuses on the current labour supply of parents it is important to emphasise the potential longrun distributional and growth consequences that missing school and childcare has for society – consequences of less education a decrease in intergenerational mobility and the hurdles they put in the way of women forced to deal with career interruptions von gaudecker et al 2020 furceri et al 2020 burgess and sievertsen 2020 we find that in 82 of couples the mother is working fewer hours and will likely step in to handle additional childcare needs see also jessen and waights 2020 first numbers from realtime surveys in germany confirm this assumption adamsprassl et al 2020 möhring et al 2020 bayer and kuhn 2020 demonstrate that starting at age 30 when children are young and need childcare the gendercareer gap opens up and contributes 50 to the gender pay gap twenty years later school and childcare closures today will thus likely negatively affect intergenerational mobility and gender equality in the workplace

article uses a new database covering eightyeight banking crises since one thousand nine hundred and ninety to draw lessons for postcovid19 resolution of nonperforming loans compared to the two thousand and eight crisis the pandemic poses some different challenges despite some respite from the creditcrash of 2008 policymakers today are faced with substantially higher public debt less profitable banks and often weaker corporate sector conditions making resolution of nonperforming loans even more challenging as a result of the covid19 pandemic the economy has come to a sudden halt this is likely to bring about high levels of nonperforming loans npls ie loans that are in or close to default high npls are problematic because they impair bank balance sheets depress credit growth and delay economic recovery aiyar et al 2015 kalemliozcan et al 2015 persistently high npl ratios were a concern in several european countries after the 20082012 crisis and the covid19 pandemic could cause a reemergence of the npl problem high npls are a common feature of banking crises and tend to be studied around such events data presented in an existing report by laeven and valencia 2013 shows that npl levels peak during crises but more data are needed to understand how npls evolve and are resolved our recent ecb working paper ari et al 2020 bridges this gap by presenting a new dataset on yearly npl evolution during eightyeight banking crises since 1990 the dataset covers major regional and global crises including the nordic crisis the asian financial crisis the global financial crisis and many standalone crises in developing transition and lowincome economies for each crisis we report npls over an 11year window around the crisis what do we learn from these data during crises npls typically follow an inverse ushaped pattern they start at modest levels rise rapidly around the start of the crisis and peak some years afterwards before stabilising and declining looking at all crises we see that npl levels peak at about 20 of total loans on average but the variance is large especially in developing countries where npls can exceed 50 of total loans only less than a fifth of banking crises avoid high npls which we define as npls exceeding 7 of total loans anticipating future levels of npls is key for formulating npl resolution strategies it is tempting to use precrisis npls to anchor such forecasts yet precrisis npl levels are not a good indicator of postcrisis npl problems after a crisis npls increase to three times their precrisis values on average and over ten times in extreme cases figure 1 note reproduced from ari chen and ratnovski 2020 figure 4 the chart shows peak npls for eightyeight banking crises since 1990 the left panel shows peak npls expressed as percent of total loans the right panel shows peak npl ratio ie nplstotal loans expressed as a multiple of the precrisis npl ratio crises that did not have high npls with npls under 7 of total loans are shown in light blue in the left panel timely npl resolution is difficult but essential for economic recovery countries can facilitate the resolution of high npls using a mix of policy measures such as • asset quality reviews to identify loans that are nonperforming and need restructuring • separating good and bad assets of banks socalled ‘good bank‘bad bank resolution this makes the financial conditions of good banks more transparent steadies their market access and lets them focus on extending new lending bad banks often structured as asset management companies proceed to extracting value from bad assets more details on npl resolution methods are provided in balgova et al 2016 beck 2017 brei et al 2020 and in ecb financial stability reviews by grodzicki et al 2015 and fell et al 2016 and 2017 despite the economic benefits of npl reduction and the variety of methods available the data paint a sobering picture of historic npl resolution while some countries resolve npls rapidly a third of countries are saddled with npls for over seven years after a crisis the npl reduction outcomes after the global crisis are direr still twothirds of the countries that experienced high npls could not resolve those within seven years of the crisis figure 2 strikingly this also implies that while advanced economies tend to have lower postcrisis npls they also take longer on average to resolve note reproduced from ari chen and ratnovski 2020 figure 6 the left panel shows the number of countries that resolved npls with npl ratios to under 7 in each year after the crisis the right panel compares the number of counties that resolved and dont resolve npls with seven years the colours distinguish the crisis waves and types in the paper we use the ‘local projections method to assess the link between npl resolution and postcrisis output dynamics while controlling for their codependence the results underscore that npl resolution is critical for economic recovery high and unresolved npls are associated with deeper recessions and slower recoveries six years after a banking crisis output in countries that experience high npls is 65 percentage points lower in countries that dont of the countries that have high npls output in countries that do not resolve npls are more than ten percentage points lower than in countries that do figure 3 a the difference in gdp after the crisis between the countries that resolve high npls compared to those that dont b the difference in gdp after the crisis between the countries that experience high npls within seven years compared to those that dont note reproduced from ari chen and ratnovski 2020 figure 6 the charts report the differences in output paths expressed as percent of deviation from precrisis output between countries that following a banking crisis experience npls exceeding 7 compared to those that have npls under 7 left panel between countries that having experienced npls exceeding 7 manage to resolve them compared to those that do not right panel npl resolution in europe after the 20082012 crisis further we use a model selection approach to assess which precrisis indicators predict the dynamics of npls in banking crises we document that peak npls are higher in countries with lower gdp per capita after a credit boom under fixed exchange rates with less profitable banks or banks with more fragile corporate balance sheets npl resolution is more protracted in similar circumstances as well as in countries with high public debt and more sophisticated banking sectors interestingly these highlevel indicators have good predictive power the average pseudo adjusted rsquared across the specifications is 024 these results shed light on the factors behind the high and persistent npls in some european countries after the 20082012 crisis in the paper we compare actual npl dynamics in seven european countries greece ireland italy portugal spain hungary and slovenia with what could have been anticipated based on historical patterns it turns out that high npl levels in europe in 2010s were hard to anticipate the crisis was extraordinarily severe for advanced economies by contrast protracted npl resolution was in line with historical patterns it is common for crises that follow a credit boom figure 4 indeed the longterm negative consequences of credit booms are welldocumented in the literature caballero et al 2008 they are related to the difficulties in resolving the debt of nonviable ‘zombie firms and households that are ‘underwater on their housing assets note reproduced from ari chen and ratnovski 2020 figure 7 the chart shows npl metrics actual in green and outofsample predicted in blue on average for a sample of european countries affected by the 20082012 crisis the metrics of npls are peak npls as percent of total loans left panel and the duration of npl resolution in years right panel what does this mean for npl resolution after covid19 even though our paper studies npls in the context of banking crises and therefore cannot be mapped perfectly to the covid19 events it provides valuable insights into impending npl challenges our results highlight forces that can make npl resolution after the covid19 events different from the situation after the 20082012 crisis some forces are enabling of npl resolution for example the covid19 pandemic is not a credit boominduced crisis if the economic downturn proves temporary many postcovid19 npls may relate to viable illiquid firms rather than unviable zombie firms european banks have entered the covid19 pandemic with on average higher capital ratios compared to the two thousand and eight crisis the recently introduced ifrs9 accounting standards may induce faster npl recognition and hence resolution thanks to their forwardlooking nature although a ‘too fast npl recognition may also constrain bank lending during downturns other forces point to challenges in npl resolution compared to 2008 most european countries have substantially higher public debt less profitable banks and often weaker corporate sector conditions the factors that historically have complicated npl resolution moreover if the economic recovery from the pandemic is slow and protracted credit losses from corporate distress will rise and could overwhelm banks further complicating npl resolution given the importance of npl reduction for economic recovery and many countries historical difficulties in implementing effective nplrelated interventions designing effective npl resolution policies for the postcovid19 world is a key forwardlooking financial policy issue for europe today editors note this column first appeared as a

global public health institutions this column considers what principles should guide whos missions and tools to deal with pandemics which are distinguished from other health risks by their high contagion extreme potential outcomes in terms of mortality risk and the ‘weaklink aspect of global collective action it argues that reforms should centre around having a narrower mission – global response to infectious diseases or grid – and creating better incentives to prevent contagions from spreading globally using stronger legal and financial tools the world health assembly the annual decisionmaking meeting of the world health organization who met in may over videoconference the squabbling over the institutions funding and political independence that erupted between the us and china highlighted the embattled state of the global public health institution facing its biggest ever challenge – the covid19 pandemic whos initial response has been heavily criticised and there is a real risk that without reforms it will wither into irrelevance eg buranyi 2020 yet the pandemic has also vividly demonstrated why who is needed given the critical role that detecting tracing and containing contagion play in saving lives across the globe economists have been active in helping us think about the appropriate policy responses to mitigate economic damage from the global pandemic focusing on fiscal and monetary policies financial regulation social insurance industry and trade baldwin and weber di mauro 2020 here we take a longerterm view and use insights from public economics and the economics of organisations to think about changes to whos mission and tools that would enable it to deal more effectively with outbreaks of infectious disease that threaten to become pandemics the emerging literature on bureaucracies and public organisations that focuses on incentive and organisation design issues in the context of the provision of public goods offers some particularly relevant lessons  dewatripont et al 1999 besley and ghatak 2018 it suggests that diffuse missions noisy output measures and task multiplicity make them appear less effective than their private sector counterparts even in the best of times and potentially disastrous in times of crisis no wonder then that who looks weak now as it did when ebola struck wenham 2017 three features distinguish this pandemic from other health risks • first as with all infectious diseases an individuals health depends not only on their own behaviour but on the behaviour of others – that is there is a large externality • second the virus contagiousness and capacity to travel means that all are vulnerable if one government the weakest link mismanages the crisis chinas initial handling of the outbreak was very much the ‘oring of global public health kremer 1993 • third the potential threat to lives and livelihoods is huge immediate and visible making the case for concerted action easier than for other global risks such as climate change these features require swift and sustained international coordination both to respond to this pandemic and to prevent future ones they also imply that the absence of global coordination might lead governments to opt for isolationism closing borders so that foreigners cant bring disease in may seem like a reasonable shortterm response but it will have enormous human and economic costs over a longer period eg trilling two thousand and twenty on the situation of refugees freund two thousand and twenty on the costs of shortening global value chains there is another solution the world has already experienced a ‘trialrun for coping with major global risks airline security in response to 911 like the current pandemic terrorism posed a grave threat and showed that the international community is only as strong as its weakest member significant progress was made in countering this threat by establishing universal airtravel security standards and monitoring their enforcement to reinvent itself to counter the threat of pandemics effectively who needs three things first a narrower focus a disease will have to meet three criteria for who intervention large global externalities high mortality risk and a ‘weaklink aspect to government action eradicating malaria for example is an extremely worthwhile goal but the disease does not travel much internationally making direct intervention as opposed to financial support of the type given by the global fund by an international institution unnecessary following the model of recent global public health funds with a narrow focus sridhar and woods 2013 who must redefine its core mission around the global response to infectious diseases – let us call this hypothetical division ‘grid other aspects of public health could be left to whos research and advisory departments this means a sharp departure from its current agenda which covers many aspects of global health from mental wellbeing to obesity with no clear prioritisation who should focus on aspects of public health for which the externalities are truly global the potential risks high and the interdependence in outcomes across countries so strong that isolated national responses wont suffice the second thing who needs is capacity – beyond that granted by the international health regulations gostin et al 2015 – to sanction countries that do not follow its rules the global community gave the wto powers to impose economic sanctions on its member states avoiding another pandemic is at least as worthy a goal as increasing global trade and should be backed with similar sanctioning power particular care must be paid to how sanctions are designed sanctioning a state in which a pandemic starts may sound like a good idea but is not credible in practice when such a disaster strikes grids mission would require it to offer the afflicted country support this means that grid cannot sanction countries based on outcomes but on the steps taken to abide by its recommendations third who needs a budget adequate to the task whos current annual budget roughly 2 billion is not much higher than the budget of the main hospital in its host city geneva determining the exact amounts needed is best left to public health specialists and epidemiologists but the current budget is clearly and grossly inadequate consider for example what it would cost to prevent the international spread of a highly contagious disease through air travel taking the estimated cost of a covid19 test 10 according to romer 2020 and the number of air passengers in two thousand and eighteen 42 billion as a benchmark 42 billion would be needed for testing international travellers alone airlines may of course be willing to foot some of the bill for these tests if their survival is at stake and we expect the number of air passengers to fall in the short run but even half that number is ten times whos current budget how would grid raise money one option would levy ‘userfees on those benefitting the most from the global movement of people something that grid would protect multinational corporations top that list torslov et al 2020 estimate that they made 17 trillion in profits from their international activities in 2015 a nontrivial share of which is booked in tax havens and therefore subject to little taxation a 5 tax on these international profits alone would generate 85 billion international air passengers and airlines could also be asked to chip in if only to pay for the testing infrastructure in airports while clearly ambitious these proposals are not without realworld precedent unitaid a global health fund is already partially funded by a tax on international air travel levied by several countries giving grid its own sources of funding would free it from relying on voluntary contributions by individual countries and shield it from the undue political influence of powerful countries eg huang 2020 these new sources of funding would need to raise enough funds to finance grids recurring prevention monitoring and research expenditures in addition grid must be given the right to borrow to mobilise funds quickly when a global public health emergency occurs if we neglect the writing on the wall about who the uncoordinated responses of national governments will hurt ordinary citizens across the globe especially the poorest and most vulnerable the virus does not respect borders or walls our response must transcend them as well baldwin r and b weber di mauro 2020 mitigating the covid economic crisis act fast and do

going stircrazy in quarantine youre not alone heres what kathy griffin is up to right now from making smoothies to writing jared kushner jokes|going stircrazy in quarantine youre not alone celebrities are cooped up in their homes across the country just like the rest of us as we collectively navigate this uncharted territory usa today presents quarantine diaries which give readers a peek into how our favorite stars are spending their time at home todays diarist is comedian kathy griffin who made a cameo in netflixs you in january and released her documentary kathy griffin a hell of a story last summer about the aftermath of her infamous donald trump photo scandal griffin 59 made headlines in march after her trip to the emergency room during which she was unable to get a coronavirus test despite unbearably painful symptoms she has since recovered and recently tested negative griffin stirred up fresh controversy tuesday tweeting that trump should be injected with a syringe with nothing but air inside it which can be lethal she has since shared her feelings following the death of george floyd heres what a day of griffins quarantine is like in california where shes quarantining with husband randy bick two employees and the couples four dogs olivia benson elliot stabler and new puppies maggie and mary named after her mother maggie mary griffin who died in march at 99 – as told to hannah yasharoff four am my husband and i are getting up about twice in the night with the dogs theyre not 100 potty trained so we still get up to take them out but the dogs have been really helpful and therapeutic i want to encourage people to foster even for just a few months its going to help you maybe more than the animal 930 am when i wake up for real business lady kathy is always working through covid or not this morning i had a conference call with two of my lawyers and my cpa im super handson with my finances in this era im kind of going through and saying do i really need this can i stop doing this ten am i make an oldschool smoothie – not from the box or anything its just fresh blueberries bananas peanut butter yakult strawberries sometimes well throw greens in there on keeping in touch with friendssia and i make these oneminute videos for each other almost every day and we send them to each other some of them are how are you feeling today and some are just silly on how her trump scandal prepared her for quarantine i kind of feel like i lost my old life twice its almost three years ago to the day of the trump photo when a big part of my old life ended with friends and work opportunities and now with covid everybody is dealing with oh gosh i actually kind of had an old life this is a sort of purgatory hopefully we get over the edge to something better lunch i will admit we have nothing close to a meal schedule around here people kind of grab their own thing when they feel like it but if we sit together we actually try to eat six feet apart i have a new diet plan that i am not recommending you know how a lot of people diet and they go six days on and one cheat day i have decided based on no data that im going to do day onday off so one day its a green drink its a vegan meal then the next day i might eat an entire cake but the point is im going to get back to the green drink the next day on writing political jokes right now every day theres obviously a deluge of scary news but then theres also one headline where im like i can spin that a crazy press conference with jared kushner for example i dont want people to think im antiamerica – i love america let the newsmakers say hes not qualified to have that job but what i can say is that every time he walks out on camera he honestly looks like he just left a spa he looks like he gets five facials a day for me this is probably the buildup to my next standup special on finding ways to help taking action is something that i love to do my assistant did a great job of tracking down a catering company that has experience bringing meals to hospitals i was proud of being able to help there i sent pizzas to urgent care – i had my assistant say they could have anything they wanted to eat and they were like pizzas i try to share feelgood things on social media and then make fun of myself in some way on staying active i am fortunate enough to have a large backyard and im still too scared to even go out on my street in a mask to walk around i put on my ipod and i have the corniest music – my friends always tease me about it theyre like did your 14yearold niece make this for you its backstreet boys celine dion josh groban lady gaga liza minnelli so theres a big square in my yard and i walk around it for an hour 730 pm i cant boil water i must confess we have a lot of discussions about if its safe to do curbside pickup lets say we want a pizza i say only restaurants that are willing to come out and put the food in the trunk of the car thats how riskaverse im trying to be what im watching 90 day fiance and i have never in my life watched more dateline and snapped this quarantine has turned me into someone who loves everything as seen on tv you know those commercials i thought i wasnt going to be buying these things until i was 90 but im super excited about my grabber ten pm one member of our little quarantine team made homemade chocolate marshmallow banana bread and then he made homemade hot fudge so i have to report a crime i think someone intruded into my home last night and accidentally put together in a really large bowl a microwaved large slice of that banana bread quite a bit of vanilla ice cream – you know burglars they take everything – and then this burglar also took the time to heat the hot fudge and put that on top of everything in the old world i might have done that once or twice a month but like everyone now i have days where im like everythings going to be great and other days where im like screw it lets have some hot fudge eleven pm well try to go to bed early which for me is around 11 but sometimes well just stay up if were really engrossed in a show we just got through season two of the crown and its one of those things where youre like want to watch one more how im feeling i hope people take this much more seriously im very frightened by the misinformation this is an opportunity for some of us to undo some of our mistakes i dont think my trump photo was a mistake and im actually quite proud of it but im hoping this will get us out of some of our bubbles i do have a little optimism that after all this we might be a little more mindful and thoughtful i of course will still be spouting vulgarity and things like that but only if youre

this column identifies the overreliance on chinese students for fee income as the main cause of the impact and considers what steps the government might take to support universities through this crisis the covid19 pandemic is having widespread effects on inequality overman 2020 furceri et al 2020 and education its effects on the uks higher education he system could also be dramatic see dolton 2020 in this column i suggest that the present financial problems of universities are rooted in their growing reliance of uk universities on the huge growth in overseas students coming to the uk for higher education this growth has been more or less exclusively from china figure one shows how the numbers of new students arriving in the uk over the years two thousand and six to two thousand and nineteen has changed the numbers coming from nearly all countries other than china has remained approximately constant but the numbers coming from china have risen from 25000 in two thousand and six to approaching 90000 by 2019 this overreliance on recruiting chinese students has meant that the uk he system is vulnerable to any change in policy from the chinese government or an exogenous event like covid19 figure two charts how the university funding system has changed over the last ten years in two thousand and ten over half of the funding came from central government now only approximately 25 of funding comes from central government the remainder comes directly from student fee income the reality is that the present uk he funding regime involves a largescale underinvestment in research and an element of cross subsidisation of fee income to fund research source authors calculations based on data from house of commons briefing paper 7393 another major headache for uk university finances has been the universities superannuation scheme uss and its associated problems this is the largest private sector pension scheme in the uk with assets of over £68 billion recent calculations indicate that the scheme has a valuation shortfall of between £66 billion reeve 2019 and £175 billion borej 2017 this will result in rising university employer contributions to the scheme exacerbating their financial problems will the overseas students come to the uk to study next academic year how bad are the implications of covid19 for the shortterm and longterm future of the uk higher education system should universities plan on opening in september or do they move their operations online the truth of the matter is that we do not presently know the exact nature of the implications of covid19 for future student demand some universities are planning for worstcase scenarios that could involve losing up to 75 of their overseas students and a drop of 20 of home students attending university this september potentially leading to severe financial trouble in this worstcase scenario it has been suggested that all universities except oxford and cambridge could become insolvent in a survey conducted by the british council 2020 it was suggested that up to 50 of postgraduate students who were planning to come to the uk are planning to defer and around 20 are likely to change where they go as a result of the covid19 pandemic if the demand for uk university education from countries like china india and many of the african countries proves to be resilient then these measures may not be necessary clearly there will be many overseas students who choose not to come to the uk in september 2020 but does this mean that they will never come surely a sizeable fraction of this demand will still be in place in september two thousand and twentyone and many students will simply defer for a year this logic may justify the government viewing the impending financial crisis of uk he as a short run liquidity crisis what measures can universities take in the short run the main issue facing universities right now is to prevent themselves from going broke in the short run and planning for the opening of campuses in september but what will happen if universities are not allowed to open again in september or indeed what happens if there is a second or subsequent wave of the pandemic universities should have contingency plans for these eventualities those without reserves or endowments will have little alternative but to make representations to central government for special financial help but it has already been signalled that this will come at the price of considerable structural reforms faced with these large expected losses in income many universities in the uk are already implementing or planning to implement hiring freezes redundancies termination of shortterm contracts dropping courses and even whole degree programmes and closing departments talk of mergers of neighbouring universities have been rumoured – although the evidence on the efficiencies to be gained is weak johnes 2013 senior management at some universities has taken a voluntary pay cut and proposed that professorial staff follow suit these measures have large adverse implications for employment in the university sector with some estimates suggesting up to 300000 job losses london economics 2020 the calculations of risk liability based on the financial position of different universities suggest that between thirty to fifty of them could be in immediate danger of insolvency london economics 2020 brackley 2020 brackley 2020 has calculated the universities that are at most risk of financial failure with an ‘at risk score that takes into account the current financial position of the university on debts and loans and their exposure to the loss of fee income from overseas students the estimated cash loss as a fraction of total income and the ordering of the ‘at risk score are presented in figure 3 cluster one includes oxford and cambridge cluster two consists of the traditional universities in the russell group cluster three consists of the other pre1992 universities and cluster four captures the remainder it shows that two of the universities with the lowest risk score the green dots of oxford and cambridge are at the extreme right end of the atrisk ordering figure three also shows that the estimated cash loss varies across universities from 020 the universities at most risk of financial failure the vertical axis in the figure come from cluster three and four but there are some potential casualties from the cluster two as well so it is possible that there could be some universities with a considerable research reputation in severe financial difficulty as a result of this pandemic what can or should the government be doing to help can a government in office be seen to allow various universities to close politically this could result in quite a high popularity hit this would be especially true if the universities in question were predominantly in the north of england scotland and wales arguably it is expensive to merge and restructure a university with a neighbour and there is relatively little evidence in favour of potential economies of scale payne 2008 but this should not prevent universities from seriously considering this option in an attempt to rationalise their provision and economise on costs another pertinent point to consider is whether neighbouring universities should be forced to merge by the government in response to the potential loss of overseas student fee income uuk 2020 asked the government for a £22 billion boost to short run research funding what the government decided to do instead was increase research funding by only £100 millio and allow an advance on undergraduate fee income from the student loans company to the tune of £26 billion this represents a loan of around 10 of fee income to universities while this loan will be a shortrun lifeline for some universities it only stores up future funding problems as these loans will inflate

of challenging the value of science and the integrity of scientists this column shows that exposure to epidemics in ones country of residence during the ‘impressionable years of ages eighteen to twentyfive has no impact on confidence in science as an enterprise but negatively affects views of the honesty and publicspiritedness of scientists covid19 will change everything for overviews of the implications see benassyquere et al two thousand and twenty and benassyquere and weder di mauro 2020 one effect it has been argued will be to reverse the secular trend of challenging the value of scientific expertise “the coronavirus crisis has put a spotlight on the importance of science in supporting our nations well being” shepherd 2020 at the same time the pandemic has put on display certain leaders “longstanding practice of undermining scientific expertise for political purposes” friedman and plumer 2020 conceivably with negative implications for how the public views science and scientists all of which points to the question posed by grove 2020 “will the coronavirus renew public trust in science” a further question is whether any change in public opinion will mainly affect the views of the scientific endeavour or individual scientists does any positive or negative reassessment of the importance and validity of science apply to both the undertaking and those engaged in it or does the public continue to have confidence in science as a potential source of a vaccine while dismissing individual scientists who warn that the time needed to develop that vaccine may be lengthy in aksoy et al 2020 we analyse this issue using the two thousand and eighteen wellcome global monitor wgm which includes responses to questions about confidence in science and scientists from more than 70000 individuals in one hundred and sixty countries the responses of interest are to questions asked of all wgm respondents “in general would you say you trust science a lot some not much or not at all” and “how much do you trust scientists” to do their work honestly with the intention of benefiting the public the geographical dispersion of the responses is in figure 1 figure one share of respondents who trust science and scientists notes panel a illustrates the share of respondents who trust science a lot or some panel b illustrates the share of respondents who trust scientists a lot or some countries are grouped in quintiles we use data on all global epidemics since one thousand nine hundred and seventy to identify respondents who experienced an epidemic outbreak in their country of residence during their formative years the stage of the life course when value systems and opinions are durably formed krosnick and alwin 1989 formalise this as the ‘impressionable years hypothesis – that core attitudes beliefs and values crystallise between the ages of eighteen and 25 spear 2000 links this to the literature in neurology describing neurochemical and anatomical differences between the adolescent and adult brain giuliano and spilimbergo 2013 show for example that experiencing a recession between the ages of eighteen and twentyfive has a powerful impact on political preferences and beliefs about the economy that persists over the life cycle to assess the effect of past exposure to an epidemic on an individuals trust in science and scientists we estimate models where the dependent variable is a dummy variable indicating whether or not the respondent has confidence in science or scientists to operationalise our treatment variable exposure to epidemic 1825 in the paper we calculate for each individual the number of people affected by an epidemic as a share of the population averaged over the eight years when the individual was in his or her formative years 1825 years old consistent with the ‘impressionable years hypothesis in addition we control for observable individual characteristics age gender educational attainment marital status religion and urbanrural residence labour market outcomes and withincountry income deciles country year and age fixed effects and countryspecific age trends we find that formativeyear epidemic exposure has a consistently negative and significant effect on whether the respondent has confidence in scientists believes that scientists working for private companies benefit the public believes that scientists working for private companies are honest and believes that scientists working for universities are honest an individual with the highest exposure to epidemics 0032 that is the number of people affected by an epidemic as a share of the population in individuals formative years relative to individuals with no exposure has on average eleven percentage points 34540032 less confidence in the honesty of scientists in contrast when the dependent variable concerns science as an undertaking or endeavour “do you have confidence in science will science and technology help to improve life is studying diseases a part of science” the coefficients in question are instead positive but do not differ significantly from zero evidently individuals who experience epidemics at first hand retain confidence in the positive potential of science as an endeavour they continue to believe in the importance of diseaserelated scientific research but they are less confident about the trustworthiness and publicspiritedness of the individuals involved in scientific endeavors given that previous work points to science education as shaping views of science and scientists we also estimate our main specification for two subsamples respondents who learned about science at most at the primary school level versus respondents who learned about science at least at the secondary school level the results suggest that our findings are driven by the sample of individuals with little or no science education it seems that science education is at least partly able to offset the adverse impact of epidemic experience on individuals trust in scientists we examined a number of sensitivity analyses to verify the robustness of the results placebo tests address the possibility that what we are picking up is not the impact on the perceived trustworthiness and publicspiritedness of scientists engaged in healthrelated research specifically but the impact on perceptions of individuals engaged in tasks related to healthcare and health outcomes more generally in contrast to its significant negative impact on confidence in scientists the results indicate no significant impact on confidence in doctors and nurses in hospitals and health clinics in ngo workers or in traditional healers we also confirmed the persistence of the impact of epidemic exposure as individuals age over time despite the fact that the confidence intervals around our estimates widen in smaller subsamples of rolling age windows we confirm that epidemic exposure between the ages of eighteen and twentyfive continues to significantly influence public perceptions in scientists trustworthiness and publicspiritedness even as the respondents age over time lastly the effect is insignificant when individuals are exposed to epidemics in any period other than when they are between eighteen and twentyfive years old these results are strongly consistent with the formativeyears hypothesis implying that the current generation experiencing covid19 in their formative years may end up distrusting scientists for a long period of their lives covid19 promises to reshape every aspect of society not excluding how science is perceived but it is not clear whether the authority of science and scientists will be enhanced or diminished or whether such changes will affect mainly science as an endeavor or scientists as individuals if past epidemics are a guide the virus will not have an impact on the regard in which science as an undertaking is held but it will reduce confidence in individual scientists worsen perceptions of their honesty and weaken the belief that their activities benefit the public the strongest impact is likely to be felt by individuals in their ‘impressionable years whose beliefs are in the process of being durably formed responding to these trends will not be straightforward at a minimum our findings suggest that scientists working on public health matters and others concerned with scientific communication should think harder about how to communicate trustworthiness and honesty and specifically about how the generation currently in their impressionable years ‘generation z perceives such attributes in addition our results suggest that scientific education will help aksoy c g b eichengren and o saka 2020 “revenge of the experts will covid19 renew or diminish public trust

looks like were going to get a full dose of government this week some good but mostly bad|looks like were going to get a full dose of government this week some good but mostly bad seems another gate has gone up to block access to pretty darned good fishing holes this time its the orange grove area in terrebonne parish i spent a day in these canals years ago with a young mike iaconelli who qualified for the bassmaster classic in new orleans while he was an amateur angler he worked his way up from 10th place that final day to finish his first classic in fifth place he returned to south louisiana a handful of years later to win the then500000 classic champions prize money this vast network has swallowed up freshwater fishermen for years and now they are denied access by a gate the louisiana sportsmens coalition stays on top of such things and its growing number of members are fighting to keep this area from adding miles to the list of coastal and nearcoast waterways denied to anglers access the issue appears to be the rush to permit construction of the gates a permit approved by terrebonne parishs mart black the director of the parishs office of coastal restoration and preservation in an alert to members the lasc indicated its research discovered the army corps of engineers never received an application for a permit to build the gates furthermore terrebonne parish scheduled a public hearing in march but the meeting was according to the lasc “shut down due to covid19 social distancing” the lasc further stated black said he approved gate construction permit after receiving no negative comments heavy email and telephone traffic prompted blacks response “i support your efforts to keep fishing free and open in terrebonne parish losing these areas due to gates is costing the parish money a solution needs to be found “my charge deals with impacts to vegetated wetlands under federal and state legislation not with gates on private property all required public notice postings were followed for this permit the longterm solution to this can only be found in baton rouge with the state legislature a law should be enacted which prohibits such gates but carefully

appropriately impose large economic costs this column taken from a voxeu ebook identifies the constraints that policy faces during a pandemic – uncertainty time and capacity – and the implications of these constraints the coronavirus is a shock to the economy the likes of which none of us has ever seen a hurricane hitting every place in the united states europe and much of the rest of the world simultaneously and hitting every day for weeks months or perhaps even a year it is partly a supply shock as workers can no longer work and supply chains get severed it is also partly a demand shock as people will cut back their demand not just for restaurants and travel but likely much else throughout the economy given the extreme nervousness about their economic situation the public health measures to flatten the curve delaying and spreading out the extent of the virus will necessarily and appropriately impose large economic costs the job of economic policy is to the greatest extent possible to protect people from those costs now and help ensure the economy is in a position to rebound quickly when the health threat is contained doing this will require a multifaceted and ambitious policy response this column is taken from the voxeu ebook mitigating the covid economic crisis act fast and do whatever it takes download the ebook here human suffering in the immediate future the human toll will be enormous most profound and consequential will be the toll on health – the illnesses and deaths from covid19 and also the collateral damage to others from an overloaded hospital system less profound but even more widespread will be the economic toll on workers who lose their jobs or see dramatic reductions in their incomes either directly because they work in an industry that is shut down as a result of the pandemic or indirectly because they work in anything in the economy which is seeing less demand as a result of all of the income loss and dramatically worsened outlook for the future the economic problems could persist well after the pandemic is contained it would be foolish just to think of what is happening as intertemporal substitution – people not going to restaurants today but then making up for it by going to even more restaurants next year there are four interrelated reasons why the economic problems could be very persistent • labour market matching means that unemployment rates can rise sharply but not fall sharply in the us financial crisis for example the unemployment rate took less than two and a half years to rise from 44 to 10 but seven years to recover the pattern is similar in previous recoveries and in other countries and is the result of the labour market matching process in which it is hard to connect people with jobs • companies will go bankrupt throughout the economy although the extent and magnitude will depend on the policy response in some cases these could be disorderly bankruptcies that separate firmspecific management capital worker capital and a nested set of arrangements and sever all of them simultaneously putting that back together will not be easy • financial institutions could come under tremendous strain and absent an ambitious policy response the economic crisis could turn into a financial crisis banks had substantial amounts of capital going into the crisis including both the required levels and additional countercyclical capital buffers in many countries but not the united states business credit lines have already been drawn loans will be extended or not repaid and funding could be increasingly difficult – all threatening to freeze up the financial system • the global aftershocks could also be large some countries may succeed in containing the virus more quickly than others some countries may succeed in containing the economic and financial damage associated with the economy more quickly than others a rolling set of epidemics in individual countries and economic crises in individual countries would create global limits on travel and continue to strain global supply chains the first is uncertainty macroeconomic policy is operating under substantial uncertainty at the best of times given the impossibility of definitive evidence from randomised control trials and the fact that the key structural parameters of the economy are likely fluctuating over time now it is operating under massive uncertainty given that we do not know the duration of the pandemic the duration of the steps that are being taken to flatten the curve the effect all of these will have on the economy and how economic policies work in this situation the second is time the change in economic activity has been larger and more abrupt than anything anyone has ever experienced on a global basis the us housing bubble peaked in 2006 european financial institutions started to have problems in the summer of 2007 economic activity slowed over the course of two thousand and seven in the united states bear stearns needed to be rescued in march 2008 and lehman brothers collapsed in september 2008 at times events went quickly but for the most part the economic situation unfolded slowly in contrast each day brings more news about the pandemic and more news about economic closures policies that are operational as quickly as possible are necessary the third constraint is capacity during the financial crisis government employees showed up at their jobs now many are teleworking and likely all will be soon many are scared and distracted by the spread of the virus some will get sick and die or if they do not will care for and grieve for others who do all of this applies to the people developing policies in places like legislatures finance ministries and central banks it also applies to the people implementing the policies at the best of times it is hard to implement administratively complex new policies and these are not the best of times these constraints have six implications • better to do too much rather than too little the current situation is one of radical uncertainty and given this radical uncertainty policy has to be based on a risk analysis of the cost of doing too little and the cost of doing too much in this case the risk analysis is increasingly clear the cost of doing too much is the time value of money which right now is negative given the negative real interest rates the cost of doing too little could potentially be enormous both in terms of immediate human suffering and a prolonged economic crisis that exceeds the one in the wake of the global financial crisis • use existing mechanisms as much as possible franklin d roosevelt engaged in “bold and persistent experimentation” in combatting the great depression this process unfolded over a decade we do not want to be combatting the economic fallout of the pandemic over the course of a decade increase funds under existing channels of assistance rather than creating new ones repeat policies that have been tried and worked at least administratively in the past • invent new programmes where necessary it will not be possible to use existing mechanisms for everything the united states for example does not have paid leave or mandatory sick days so needs to invent and implement them in the middle of the pandemic no country has sufficient mechanisms to deal with abrupt revenue stops in a large number of sectors across the economy • diversify and do not fear duplication or unintended ‘winners in the response given the uncertainty about the economic situation the impact of policies and the new policies that are being invented it is worth diversifying the response many policies will have to be tried some will work others will not many will be wasteful giving money to people or businesses that do not need it – or even giving it to the same ones twice the risk of duplication is much smaller than the risk of overtargeting that leaves many out • enlist the private sector as much as possible the private sector will be operating under many of the same operational constraints as the government but it has an existing infrastructure can be nimble and can form a diversification of the response direct government lending is hard but loan guarantees can enlist the private sector to make the loans the private sector will make the additional food and hospital equipment but will need financial incentives some will end up making a profit out of all of this now is not the time to be squeamish • ensure the response is dynamic and persistent the damage is uncertain it may vary across places it may last a long time policy needs to be ready to stay in place and even grow in the places and times it is needed the more that policies can have triggers to automatically continue and expand in places and times they are needed the better what a policy response should look like the exact policy response will vary from country to country but here are some ways to operationalise the principles above • spare no expense on health testing hospital systems antiviral and vaccine research and anything else that is needed should be funded • targeted assistance using existing programmes in the united states this means expanding eligibility for unemployment insurance although that is hard because eligibility rules vary across the fifty states and the district of columbia increasing the amount of benefits 50 per week added and expanding other programmes for the most vulnerable like the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap in addition increasing federal funding for states is critical and one of the best mechanisms for this the united states is increasing the share of medicaid paid by the federal government • cash payments to households

the dying vivacity within the tattoo shop was indicative of the impending shutdown the shop voluntarily closed their doors two days later|friday the 13th is consistently anticipated to be an eventful day among horror film fanatics and the subtly superstitious but it is also a significant day in tattoo shops across the country sailors believed that tattooing the traditionally unlucky number thirteen on their bodies would deter bad luck from following them which encouraged others to flaunt the symbol with simple spooky designs dallas tattoo artist oliver peck turned this trend into an event in the ‘90s and tattoo shops have been celebrating the mystic day with special events and mysteriously low prices — typically 13 mysterious — since ironically friday the 13th was the last time durhams welcome tattoo shop was operating normally the march thirteen event was supposed to be a party — the owners booked wonderpuff to serve gourmet cotton candy and planned giveaways for those who joined the gathering the festivities however were quickly adapted to address the rising concerns about covid19 in the state the owners modified this notoriouslycrowded celebration into a firstcome firstserved flash event clients could choose a piece of palmsized flash for 130 and all proceeds went toward the nonprofit of the clients choice welcome tattoo maintained the artistry and convenient prices of each friday the 13th but sacrificed its electric atmosphere to protect the durham community “we already clean a lot as you can imagine” owner morgan grimm said “we just became extra aware of cleanliness wiping down clipboards and door handles after every customer we limited the number of people allowed in the shop at one time and only let in people who were actually being tattooed” lively and inviting energy is necessary for a tattoo shop — even if buzzing needles and bloodstained gloves threaten your bravado there is comfort in the echoing postgrunge playlists and muffled admiration for wallhung collages the dying vivacity within the tattoo shop was indicative of the impending shutdown the shop voluntarily closed their doors two days later “it all happened so fast we went from not hearing about anything coronavirusrelated to being affected by it overnight” grimm said “we felt that closing was the best thing to do for our community at the time” a week after welcome tattoo closed gov roy cooper ordered personal care and grooming services to close by march twentyfive at five pm all barber shops hair nail and beauty salons and massage and tattoo parlors were shut down due to their inability to provide service while social distancing these businesses are dependent on inperson contact and as a result are desperately struggling through the covid19 crisis restaurants and retail shops are undeniably experiencing financial losses but they can still partially operate under current conditions tattoo artists on the other hand cannot deliver their product to your doorstep “i feel like tattoo shops nail techs hairdressers massage therapists a lot of those inperson services are just in a complete standstill” grimm expressed “there is really not much that can be done until we see a decline in cases” in addition to losing a steady source of revenue many new businesses have not been operating long enough to qualify for small business loans oneyearold welcome tattoo too new to obtain such loans has utilized creative methods of bringing in money grimm explained how one tattooer kohen meyers has been creating and selling his artwork in an unpromising attempt to earn an income as the pandemic prohibits his livelihood the shop also hosted a raffle in which the winner would receive a free original flash design — designs that typically cost anywhere from 100 to 500 amid selling merchandise and hosting raffles for the shop welcome tattoos main focus has been promoting other small businesses in durhamtheir instagram page kindly pushes followers to donate to the triangle restaurant workers relief fund for the chance to win a free flash tattoo “right when we closed we did a big raffle for the triangle restaurant workers relief fund we realized were not the only ones going through this” grimm explained “i think durham has always been great about supporting local businesses so it is nice that we can continue to do that” ultimately small businesses are depending on the support of consumers — their neighbors — to stay afloat it may seem inconvenient to scope out a local business carrying the products you want instead of visiting your preferred cookiecutter capitalist wonderland but shopping small benefits the entire community not to mention locally created products — from pincho locos refreshing ice cream to heavenly buffaloes latenight greasy satisfaction — allows customers to explore the city through innovative artistic products crafted by people passionate about their work theyre working for you and right now they need you more than ever “buy from local shops and local restaurants as much as possible buy from them instead of amazon or a major chain store weve been buying groceries from our neighbor accordion club” grimm said “whats really important is that financial support if youre not able to financially support then share what those businesses are doing with your friends and family on social media to help bring in customers” as a writer and reporter i would typically end this article with some drawnout moral message that i can only hope resonates with each reader but as someone who loves and misses the durham community i would much rather ask you to support the local businesses and people that complete the durham experience even if your experience only lasts four years now is not the time to pretend i have some profound wisdom to share if you are able to please shop small shop local shop durham|2020-05-30|0.9996|positive|0.10226750144974443|positive

glass on the sidewalks burnedout buildings vulgar and threatening graffiti sprayed on buildings and streets all this while a pandemic that has claimed 106000 americans remains unchecked with most of the strictures that crashed the us economy  closing stadiums museums theaters amusement parks and basically the entire service sector  still in place amid it all none these interlocking crises have made our leading civic institutions any less partisan apparently and that includes the media remember when social media was touted as an innovation that would help bring human beings together do you recall when the 24hour news cycle was envisioned as a technological advancement that would keep americans better informed well social media can bring people together and it does every day the platforms can also be used to recruit terrorists foreign and domestic likewise cable news has the wherewithal to keep citizens better informed but there are business considerations at play that mitigate the good along with human considerations political bias personal pettiness and the pressures of competition it was forty years ago today that ted turner launched cable news network in a

christensen compiled this list in realclearhistory misperceptions of what the opposite sex finds attractive realclearscience editor ross pomeroy spotlights the findings of a new study cnns first challenge of course was to be profitable by the time of its launch founder ted turner didnt need the money  he was a billionaire when that was rare  but it needed to attract enough viewers and advertisers to justify the tremendous cost of fielding news crews around the country and the world support a vigorous washington bureau and a home base in atlanta skeptics abounded was there even enough news a new yorker cartoon from the early days illustrated the problem it depicted a dead bird its feet in the air with a cnn camera crew on the spot “a sparrow falls” read the caption “and cnn goes live” in truth those at the networks creation knew right away they were on to something three days before the its launch civil rights leader vernon jordan had been wounded in an attempted assassination on june 1 president jimmy carter visited jordan in the hospital  and spoke to cnns cameras as he emerged “you know” cnn script copy editor randy harber thought to himself “this is going to work” sometimes it worked too well such as on jan 28 one thousand nine hundred and eightysix when the space shuttle challenger exploded in midair and cnn anchors and correspondents found themselves trying to explain to americans including many children why six astronauts and a popular schoolteacher were never coming home to their loved ones a milestone event came during the persian gulf war by then cnn had been meeting the challenge of live 24hour television for a decade and proving itself up to the task the established networks broke into their regular programming when the shooting started but only cnn had a team on the scene at baghdads rashid hotel when the airstrikes began in a free country success will spawn imitators and so it was with cnn by 1989 europes sky news was on the air twentyfour hours a day and by the mid1990s rupert murdoch  who owned sky news  decided to give cnn a run for its money fox news channel promised even higher production values than its rival and something else as well an ideological correction “fair and balanced” was the slogan coined by roger ailes but this was said with a wink and a nod what it really meant was that fox news was going to offer ballast in a media marketplace dominated by liberal sensibilities at first cnn ignored the usurper even as conservatives took to trolling cnn as the “clinton news network” eventually as fox news consistently attracted more viewers than cnn and upstart msnbc combined a change of heart occurred in the presidential two thousand and twelve campaign msnbc had emerged as the liberal alternative  it was the barack obama network if you will later many observers would still view cnn as proclinton even though a different clinton was running for president and fox news remained reliably republican in its orientation by 2013 none of this could be ignored writing in politico media critic dylan byers began an analysis of the problem with a provocative opening sentence aimed at the dc chattering class “this is the quickest way to turn a pleasant dinner party into a shouting match posit that msnbc is not as bad as fox news but rather worse than fox news” objectively msnbc was by then much worse than fox if one believes the mission of the news business is to offer facts rather than propaganda an exhaustive pew research center study done earlier that year showed the 85 of msnbcs programming was devoted to opinion and only 15 to reporting at fox the ratio was much better  55 opinion and 45 news cnn hadnt yet reached the 50 tipping point but it was getting close by the time of donald trumps election it would  without ever admitting it  throw in the towel and join the resistance on sunday as the nypd tried to quell riots cnn president jeff zucker let it slip that he is thinking of running for mayor of new york although this speculation isnt new it set off the predictable kvetching in conservative circles you know about mike bloombergs conflicts of interest as the founderofbloombergnewsturnedmayorturned2020democraticpresidentialcandidate and about whether the democratic party would owe zucker back pay  that sort of thing but this critique misses the mark the

health organization has staff in mbandaka the main city …|the following is a nearverbatim transcript of todays noon briefing by stéphane dujarric spokesman for the secretarygeneral good afternoon so we are starting a new month which is always good hopefully the technology will be with us this month and i wanted to flag that tomorrow the secretarygeneral will be addressing the opening of a highlevel virtual pledging event for the humanitarian crisis in yemen something that we have been flagging here almost on a daily basis that event is cohosted by the united nations and the kingdom of saudi arabia it will start at nine am new york time and you will be able to watch it on the un webtv platform twentyfour million people — thats eighty per cent of the population in yemen — need aid and protection the humanitarian operation assists more than ten million people every month however without additional funding lifesaving programmes will soon be forced to reduce or even close in what is the worlds largest humanitarian crisis a press conference will follow the event at 110 pm new york time media questions should be submitted in advance and up until two hours before the closing of the event on whatsapp or by email to our ocha media colleagues if you want those numbers please reach out to us turning to libya yacoub elhillo the humanitarian coordinator for libya said over the weekend that he was shocked by the horrific reports about wednesdays shooting at a smuggling warehouse in mezda killing thirty migrants and injuring eleven others he said that authorities with influence on the ground in the area where this incident took place have the responsibility to ensure that human smugglers and traffickers are not allowed to continue their inhuman and degrading acts such heinous and merciless crimes against helpless individuals should be investigated immediately and those responsible have to be brought to justice and on burundi i wanted to say that the secretarygeneral notes that the relative calm that characterized election day continues to prevail in burundi he reiterates his call to all parties to ensure that their words and actions promote peace and harmony among all burundians the secretarygeneral emphasizes that any electoral dispute should be addressed through established legal and constitutional channels under burundi law the secretarygeneral reiterates the support of the united nations to the people and government of burundi and a newly published paper issued by the office of the united nations special coordinator for the middle east peace process unsco argues that the covid19 emergency underscores the inadequacy of the frameworks governing the economic and administrative relationships between israel and palestine nickolay mladenov the special coordinator welcomed the recent israelipalestinian cooperation to deal with the health crisis but the special coordinators office warns that if current trends continue the achievements of the palestinian government over the last quarter century will fade the peace and security situation will worsen and a hardened and more extremist politics on both sides will inevitably result mr mladenov adds “all sides must do their part in the coming weeks and months in order to preserve the prospect of a negotiated twostate resolution to the conflict in line with relevant un resolutions international law and bilateral agreements” turning to latin america and the caribbean our humanitarian colleagues tell us that nearly 938000 cases and over 49000 associated deaths were reported as of saturday across the region relating to covid that surpasses europe and the us in daily infections according to the world health organization the region is now the new epicentre of the pandemic south america — where brazil peru chile and ecuador have the most cases — has over 800000 infected people and over 38000 deaths the united nations has been supporting governments and civil society in the region through its different agencies funds and programmes including for the development of national response plans to the pandemic in venezuela the un and our partners have been providing assistance to more than one million people since midmarch mostly in the areas of water sanitation and hygiene in colombia over 750000 people have been reached since the end of april mainly with health response and in haiti the un continues to support national authorities in strengthening health response capacity and disseminating awareness messaging while they continue to deliver critical lifesaving support in other areas particularly food and just a quick focus today on guatemala where there are more than 4700 confirmed cases of the virus and more than one hundred deaths the un team on the ground has been supporting the governments emergency response to the virus and has provided 1 million from the un multipartner trust fund as you will recall this is the fund announced by the secretarygeneral for the socioeconomic recovery and response the un team led by the resident coordinator rebeca arias is focusing on providing health services protecting and training health workers and improving surveillance capacities this includes improving lab capacity and boosting womens access to health services the un is working to protect human rights this initiative includes guaranteeing decent quarantine locations for migrants who have returned to guatemala several un entities are involved in this such as the international organization for migration

additional 600000 for medical hygiene and protection supplies as well as training shelters and communications campaign to prevent the spread of covid19 and i want to flag that in a joint video message released today the executive director of unwomen phumzile mlambongcuka the undersecretarygeneral for political and peacebuilding affairs rosemary dicarlo and the undersecretarygeneral for peace operations jeanpierre lacroix made a call to ensure women are central to global ceasefire efforts the three officials said the pandemic is a wakeup call the world cannot face conflict and a pandemic at the same time in their message they stressed that women need to be fully engaged and if so we will emerge stronger from the crisis the message is online and available in eight languages a new survey released today by the world health organization who shows that prevention and treatment services for noncommunicable diseases have been severely disrupted since the covid19 pandemic began the survey which was completed by one hundred and fiftyfive countries during a threeweek period in may confirmed that the impact is global but that lowincome countries are the ones being affected the most who warns that this situation is of significant concern because people living with noncommunicable diseases are at higher risk of severe covid19related illness and death who said that a record number of countries are now monitoring and reporting on antibiotic resistance who warned that the data they provide reveals that a worrying number of bacterial infections are increasingly resistant to the medicines at hand to treat them who is concerned that the trend will further be fuelled by the inappropriate use of antibiotics during the covid19 pandemic evidence shows that only a small proportion of patients with the virus need antibiotics to treat subsequent bacterial infections who has issued guidance not to provide antibiotic therapy or prophylaxis to patients with mild covid19 or to patients with suspected or confirmed moderate covid19 illnesses unless there is a clinical indication to do so and a new ebola outbreak has been identified in the democratic republic of the congo this time the virus is impacting people in the countrys west in the equateur province the congolese health ministry has identified six cases including four people who have died on twitter today the head of who dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said the agency already has staff in the main city in equateur in mbandaka which is the town impacted they are supporting the response to the new ebola outbreak this is happening as you know as the drc is in the final phases of battling the virus in the countrys east dr tedros added this is a reminder that covid19 is not the only health threat that people face who

the covid19 crisis looks set to accelerate an overdue transformation of the worldrsquos largest ecosystem we expect nine shifts to radically change the construction value chain and offer a blueprint for the next normal ahead|this article was a collaborative global effort among maria joão ribeirinho jan mischke gernot strube erik sjödin jose luis blanco rob palter jonas biörck david rockhill and timmy andersson the construction industry and its broader ecosystem erects buildings infrastructure and industrial structures that are the foundation of our economies and are essential to our daily lives it has successfully delivered ever more challenging projects from undersea tunnels to skyscrapers however the industry also has performed unsatisfactorily in many regards for an extended period of time the covid19 pandemic may be yet another crisis that wreaks havoc on an industry that tends to be particularly vulnerable to economic cycles external market factors combined with fragmented and complex industry dynamics and an overall aversion to risk have made change both difficult and slow the covid19 crisis looks set to dramatically accelerate the ecosystems disruption that started well before the crisis in such times it is more important than ever for actors to find a guiding star for what the next normal will look like in the aftermath and make the bold strategic decisions to emerge as a winner many studies have examined individual trends such as modular construction and sustainability this report provides an assessment of how the full array of disruptive trends will combine to reshape the industry in earnest our research builds future scenarios based on more than one hundred conversations with experts and executives firsthand experience serving clients throughout the ecosystem and reviews of other industries and their transformation journeys we confirmed the trends and scenarios that surfaced by conducting a survey of four hundred global industry leaders finally we quantitatively modeled value and profit pools across the value chain based on company data today and formulated future scenarios we found overwhelming evidence that disruption will touch all parts of the industry and that it has already begun at scale among our findings are the following • construction is the biggest industry in the world and yet even outside of crises it is not performing well the ecosystem represents thirteen percent of global gdp but construction has seen a meager productivity growth of one percent annually for the past two decades time and cost overruns are the norm and overall earnings before interest and taxes ebit are only around five percent despite the presence of significant risk in the industry • nine shifts will radically change the way construction projects are delivered—and similar industries have already undergone many of the shifts a combination of sustainability requirements cost pressure skills scarcity new materials industrial approaches digitalization and a new breed of player looks set to transform the value chain the shifts ahead include productization and specialization increased valuechain control and greater customer centricity and branding consolidation and internationalization will create the scale needed to allow higher levels of investment in digitalization rd and equipment and sustainability as well as human capital • the covid19 crisis will accelerate change that has already started to occur at scale our research suggests that the industry will look radically different five to ten years from now more than seventyfive percent of respondents to our executive survey agreed that the nine shifts are likely to occur and more than sixty percent believe they are likely to occur at scale in the next five years we already see concrete signs of change for example the permanent modular construction market share of new north american realestate construction projects has grown by fifty percent from two thousand and fifteen to 2018 rd spending among the top 2500 construction companies globally has risen by approximately seventyseven percent since 2013 and a new breed of player has emerged to lead the change twothirds of survey respondents believe that covid19 will lead to an acceleration of the transformation and half have already raised investment in that regard • a 265 billion annual profit pool awaits disrupters a value chain delivering approximately 11 trillion of global value added and 15 trillion of global profit pools looks set for overhaul in a scenario based on analysis and expert interviews by asset class strongly affected segments could have a staggering forty to fortyfive percent of incumbent value added at risk even when the economic fallout from covid19 abates—value that could shift to new activities such as off site manufacturing to customer surplus or to new sources of profit if the value at stake is captured by players in the construction ecosystem total profit pools could nearly double from the current five to ten percent the scale and pace of change and the appropriate response will differ greatly among realestate infrastructure and industrial construction—but all of them will be affected players that move fast and manage to radically outperform their competitors could grab the lions share of the 265 billion in new and shifting profits and see valuations more akin to those of silicon valley startups than traditional construction firms • to survive and thrive incumbents must respond all of the players in the construction value chain will need to develop their strategies for dealing with or leading disruption this is especially true for engineering and design materials distribution and logistics general contracting and specialized subcontracting all of which are likely to face commoditization and declining shares of value for parts of their activities companies can try to defend their positions and adjust to the changing environment or reinvent themselves to take advantage of changes in the industry all will need to invest in enablers like agile organizations • investors are well advised to use foresight on the respective shifts in their investment activity and will have ample opportunity to generate alpha policy makers should help the industry become more productive and achieve better housing and infrastructure outcomes for citizens and owners stand to benefit from better structures at lower cost if they play their part in making the shifts happen maria joão ribeirinho is a partner in

conferences and public health warnings that ended with the same directive stay at home to slow the spread of covid19 when the white house suggested slowly reopening state economies the president was lambasted governors and protesters pushing for the same were similarly admonished for not sufficiently valuing life time seemed to speed back up in the last week after the death of george floyd the streets of oncelockeddown cities have been flooded with shouldertoshoulder protesters in daylight and rioters at night some wear masks others dont criticism has been scant overall whiplashed trump world has a question whatever happened to social distancing “it wasnt long ago that democrats and the media claimed that republican governors reopening their economies were putting their citizens at risk and had ‘blood on their hands” trump campaign deputy press secretary courtney parella told realclearpolitics “but now nothing but crickets about the thousands of protesters not wearing masks or social distancing” “none of those facts fit their narrative weve been told to stay home social distance and wear a mask” the campaign spokeswoman continued “but the streets are open for violent riots” hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets over the weekend to condemn police brutality and in cities like atlanta los angeles and new york they have often turned violent an official with the white house coronavirus task force meanwhile told rcp that the guidelines offered by the centers for disease control and prevention remain in effect stay at least six feet apart from others wear a mask in public stay home when possible public protests even when peaceful do not lend themselves to social distancing and joining arms in common cause can inadvertently spread the virus it was enough to frighten deborah birx “i worry terribly about the peaceful protests i see some wearing masks i see some others not wearing masks” the white house coronavirus response coordinator told pbs “and so we are really trying to work with each of the mayors to expand testing availability over the next week or two so that the individuals who are involved in the peaceful protests can get tested” ramping up testing capacity has been an arduous process one that was painfully slow in the weeks preceding the death of floyd now it should be accelerated even more for protesters according to a letter signed by 1288 public health professionals infectious diseases professionals and community stakeholders who say the risk of spreading the virus while peacefully protesting is worth taking white supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to covid19 the letter reads and while cdc guidance can save lives the cosigners write that “as public health advocates we do not condemn these gatherings as risky for covid19 transmission” the antilockdown protests of previous months like those in michigan however are “rooted in white nationalism and run contrary to respect for black lives” robbie goldstein an infectious disease physician and candidate for the massachusetts 8th congressional district supports the protests its the use of tear gas that concerns him “police are teargassing peaceful protesters during the worst respiratory pandemic weve ever faced they are compounding the health risks to those fighting for justice by using weapons of war” goldstein told rcp before calling on congress to ban the use of the riot control tool conservatives gripe that they werent given the same consideration when they assembled in opposition to the economically devastating lockdowns they protested they never looted they were told their actions endangered public health delayed reopening the economy and that for their civil disobedience they ought to forgo treatment for the virus if they got sick this double standard doesnt sit well over at the white house one senior official there sees a conspiracy one thats “endemic to the media” “there was a realization that their efforts to lock people in their homes was not going to continue forever and that the white house effort to deal with the coronavirus outbreak was indeed successful” the official complained “now theyve got a new crisis theyre trying to bludgeon the president with” rep jody hice feels the same way and offered a similar diagnosis time has not dragged so slowly to keep the georgia republican from remembering how his governor brian kemp was accused of having “blood on his hands” for reopening his state in may kemp reopened the state with restrictions that governed public gatherings and limited which businesses could operate and how confirmed cases of the virus have not spiked they have plateaued so why the condemnation of kemp and trump but acceptance of the massive social gatherings in the last week “no 1 you just have massive hypocrisy” hice concluded “i think it comes down to extreme hatred for the president” there has not been any medical breakthrough in combating the virus no cure exists and public health officials warn that a vaccine could be months if not years away “if covid19 was as dangerous two weeks ago as they say it was well its equally as dangerous now” hice said “the unwillingness to face that reality just highlights utter bias and hypocrisy”|2020-06-01|-0.9988|negative|-0.07480791214557447|negative

as scientists around the world return to work theyre encountering new safety rules and awkward restrictions — and sometimes writing the protocols themselves|after her university closed in march jeannine randall sat down to adapt her research plan for a pandemic her project to monitor tree swallows through the spring and summer with a team of three scientists would now require travelling to the nesting sites in separate vehicles using individual work kits staying two metres apart and of course sanitizing regularly when she realized hand sanitizer was in short supply in shops she made her own batch using ethanol from her lab now as her school the university of northern british columbia in prince george canada resumes some services she is putting the plan into action counting eggs waiting for hatchlings and watching the birds from daybreak to sundown “i think scientists are very well placed in some ways to come up with a protocol that makes sense and then follow it” says randall an avian ecologist as countries around the world begin lifting pandemic lockdowns researchers are entering a new phase of work — donning masks with their lab coats staggering hours in laboratory spaces and taking shifts on shared instruments some universities have created detailed plans to track and test staff and many have limited the capacity of indoor spaces and the flow of people through hallways and entrances for others postlockdown plans are still taking shape and whereas some universities have worked in lockstep with governments to formulate safety plans others have charted their own paths cull release or bring them home coronavirus crisis forces hard decisions for labs with animals university associations in the united states estimate that research there will need a boost of at least us26 billion to get back up to speed among them the association of american universities in washington dc is drafting a set of priorities for university leaders to consider as they tackle reopening of more than 3000 researchers who responded to an online nature reader poll last month just under half said that they are still on lockdown following national policy trends scientists in the united kingdom united states and brazil were among the most likely to report restrictions whereas only about 7 of those from germany did see ‘getting back to business “now we are mostly back to normal apart from wearing face masks and having to maintain a certain distance between each other” says boyan garvalov a cancer researcher at heidelberg university who juggles his career with monitoring his kids online learning he currently splits time at home with his spouse trading shifts at work gloves and masks at all times in italy which was hit particularly hard early in the global pandemic nearly 30 of roughly ninety respondents to the nature poll say that they have returned to work and another 18 report having worked throughout lockdowns one of these is cell biologist paolo bernardi who went into the university of padua nearly every working day to oversee a skeleton staff and teach his pathophysiology class over zoom “now we are seeing better days” bernardi says his lab is at about 50 capacity university guidelines for resuming work in effect since twentysix april require distances of one metre between people in brief contact increased to two

coronavirus pandemic could change research at the university of groningen in the netherlands researchers have been asked to avoid working with hazardous chemicals when they can to minimize the risk of spills that would require medical attention according to jana volaric a synthetic organic chemist but for her the biggest impact is the diminished conference schedule she had hoped to be networking in anticipation of being on the job market next year and she says that meaningful interactions are harder to come by at online conferences “this is the most disappointing part” ‘singing from the same song sheet organic chemist kirsty anderson lost about four weeks of work when the university of auckland in new zealand closed down along with the rest of the country it reopened partially a few weeks ago and instituted many of the restrictions seen in europe but it also required people who entered the building to mark their time of entry and location on timesheets and maintain a distance of two metres between people at all times with lift access restricted to one person at a time she often climbed the seven flights of stairs to get to the lab with more services opening in midmay the checkin

document how countries are using genomics to help avoid a second coronavirus wave winston byblow a neuroscientist who studies motor function after strokes at the university of auckland says the government and university are united in their safety messaging and pandemic response “everyone is singing from the same song sheet” he says hes worried however that experiments with human participants might take a hit for a while people are going to be wary about taking part in trials for many months because of concerns about being in enclosed spaces with others he says “if recruitment rates drop because of uncertainty or fear then it just means that its going to take a lot longer to complete the research and that comes at a cost” other universities are striking out on their own jorge huetepérez is a molecular biologist and vicepresident at the university of central america in managua a private university with about 8000 students the institution formulated its own lockdown plan — reducing the number of people on campus by about 90 — independent of the nicaraguan government which put in place no measures to mitigate the viruss spread the pandemic arrived late in central america and reports put the total number of cases in nicaragua at less than 800 but huetepérez thinks the real number is higher more in step with or perhaps higher than the 1000 cases reported in neighbouring costa rica and roughly 5000 in honduras “we dont really know the real dimensions of the covid situation” he says when it is time reopen in the absence of guidelines from the nicaraguan government he anticipates that he will look to independent medical organizations and the who to inform the universitys plan to set coronavirus policy model lives and livelihoods in lockstep in the united states as the presidential administration and the centers for disease control and prevention clashed over the plan for a postpandemic return to work the university of california san diego drafted a detailed one of its own including an ambitious screening and testing regime for staff and students to come into effect in the autumn that relies on campus labs to process samples the pilot phase begun on may 11 tested more than 1000 students and ended last week but that approach is something of an anomaly in the united states policies and priorities can differ drastically between states “the situation is changing pretty rapidly and the stakes are very high” says peter schiffer a physicist and former viceprovost for research at yale university in new haven connecticut who is a senior fellow at the aau a number of universities have adjusted their schedules or delayed students return to campus until next year but have yet to firm up plans for researchers the logistics are unparalleled says tobin

the pandemic has exacerbated tension between church and state and between religious figures in many places|editors note some of our covid19 coverage is free for readers of the economist today our daily newsletter for more stories and our pandemic tracker see our hub from deagu in south korea to qom in iran mulhouse in france and sacramento in california places of collective worship have often been accelerators of coronavirus contagion months later with lockdowns starting to ease in the rich world some religious groups have been loudly demanding a return to normality and complaining that their needs have been forgotten in france houses of worship have opened earlier than planned because of a successful appeal by conservative religious groups to the council of state the highest administrative court and the high court in london has agreed to hear an appeal from a mosque leader in bradford a stronghold of islam who says stopping friday prayers curbed his religious liberty the clash between religious and secular authority is felt most keenly in america on may 29th the supreme court voted 54 to reject an appeal from a church in california south bay united pentecostal against restrictions imposed by the states democratic governor gavin newsom conservative court members saw merit in the churchs complaint that the constitutional right to free exercise of religion was being violated but they were overruled often president donald trumps administration has sided with churches in disputes with local or state authorities seeking to enforce stayathome orders on may 22nd mr trump demanded the reopening of churches deeming them “essential” covid19 has exacerbated not only tension between churches and states but also disagreements between different religious tendencies religious figures have denounced one another either for being too reckless or for being too meekly compliant with government orders these disputes may be a symptom of a wider phenomenon in the words of austen ivereigh a biographer of pope francis the virus has “deepened existing faultlines and exposed a few new ones” in the realm of religion for example he says some believers see in the covid crisis a deadly threat to religious liberty others dismiss that view those faultlines are particularly evident in liberaldemocratic countries where practising religion of any kind or style or firmly rejecting religion is an open choice not a default mode to understand the biggest chasm imagine two camps that are defined by what they fear and dislike most in one are religious groups whose strongest impulse is to improve the material lot of humanity by fighting poverty or pollution they are open to working with secular agencies including governments and supranational bodies where they can be a force for the common good in the other camp faith communities believe the main challenge is secularism the wateringdown of old certainties the threat posed by new thinking about sex and gender—all perceived evils deemed to be perpetrated by liberal elites and secular government authorities the faultline does not neatly separate religions it often divides denominations take the split in catholic ranks in his response to the pandemic pope francis reaffirmed his preference for the more humanitarian camp by establishing a highlevel panel to advise not just on the disease itself but also on the challenges that will follow unemployment strained welfare budgets the need for new definitions of economic value on may 31st he marked the feast of pentecost by leading a sparse maskwearing flock in prayers in st peters square he urged special concern for the worlds vulnerable including the indigenous people of the amazon “that they may not lack health care” the readmission of a wellpoliced crowd marked some relief from the empty expanse which francis faced seven weeks earlier at easter yet the popes declared opponents including raymond burke an american cardinal have redoubled their attacks on him for being too compliant with worldly authorities which may have dark agendas in chastising restrictions preventing the faithful from going to mass cardinal burke wrote “we cannot simply accept the determinations of secular governments which would treat the worship of god in the same manner as going to a restaurant or to an athletic contest” he has also aligned himself with conspiracy theorists in suggesting that the virus might lead to compulsory vaccines or even the subcutaneous microchipping of people by an allcontrolling state to a degree the divide splits europe and america in part because of their differing collective memories americans abhor stateimposed religious orthodoxy whereas europeans have a theocratic tradition whose current form is emollient the humanitarian camp is much stronger in europe at least among established christian hierarchies bishops have raised few objections to lockeddown churches but they have weighed in on social and political issues in britain for example the archbishop of canterbury justin welby the head of englands established church warned the government against returning to austerity to repay the fastrising pile of public debt several other bishops openly rebuked dominic cummings a primeministerial adviser who made a long roadtrip during a lockdown in some european countries observers have seen a subtle christian influence in policy responses to the virus always working with the grain of the liberal state not against it in germany for example theologians have taken part in a commission that pondered how to allocate medical resources in an acute crisis it concluded that a persons ability to recover—but not age itself—should be a criterion on both the secular and religious right in the united states by contrast the argument has sometimes been made that saving the old and vulnerable should not always take priority over saving the economy or simply practising religion rusty reno editor of an influential religious journal first things made waves by arguing that it was unchristian to focus too much on avoiding death “there are many things more precious than life and yet we have been whipped into such a frenzy in new york that most family members will forgo visiting sick parents” he complained in a muchcontested editorial on may 11th he tweeted that wearing masks was tantamount to “enforced cowardice” that prompted rod dreher another widely read pundit to describe his fellow conservatives utterance as “contemptible” mr reno subsequently withdrew the tweet and apologised meanwhile in california an influential orthodox priest josiah trenham has rejoiced in recent days over the widespread “civil disobedience” by the states churches which was in his view forcing the governor to retreat from a “large unjustified overreach of the civil authority” in curbing the practice of faith these “theocon” objections to the lockdowns have been advanced on roughly three grounds that they damage the economy that public worship is more important than anything else people do and that human freedom to do anything at all is being unfairly restricted such things would be hard to say in europe one of the many reasons for that according to religionwatchers is the european reading of christianity especially in the post1945 era when the continents leading thinkers secular and religious have had a horror of any attitude that favoured cold economic or ideological calculation over basic decency among europes christian democrats like those who dominate german politics this religious influence is acknowledged in varying degrees and even scandinavian social democracy on the face of things a godless creed has clear historic roots in the regions lutheran tradition which emphasises good citizenship says nick spencer of theos a london thinktank for pious traditionalists that nordic example is a warning not an inspiration wherever religion merges with social welfare they would retort it virtually ceases to exist still not all religious disputes have got worse one of the pandemics surprises is that traditional faith communities as well as newfangled ones have responded creatively to the need for new forms of worship in one german town a catholic priest and a female lutheran minister experimented with a drivein service where people could enjoy the singing and preaching through their car radios to a traditionalist catholic this mixing of sexes denominations and rites breaks every rule of church order but plainly some of the faithful like it and they may want more|2020-06-01|-0.2692|negative|0.06773107299824858|positive

“a little differently about things than other people” she also talks a little differently her bedside manner was abrupt and to the point  and not a little foreboding  at a recent white house cabinet meeting the health and human services assistant secretary for mental health and substance use the first person to hold that new post delivered a warning mccancekatz told the president and his assembled secretaries that “the cure” for the covid19 pandemic has unintended but potentially grave consequences she explained that selfisolation while necessary to prevent spread of the virus would exacerbate preexisting mental conditions and predicted that socalled deaths of despair would rise as lockdowns continued “a life lost to suicide is just as important as a life lost to coronavirus” mccancekatz insisted citing the nations “already overburdened mental health care system” she added “im saddened but certain that the next major public health crisis of our time will be that of mental and substance use disorders it is not far behind” the nation has been on lockdown in one way or the other for the better part of three months with trump arguing all the while that such measures cannot become permanent “we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself” he tweeted with allcaps emphasis soon after restrictions were put in place “at the end of the fifteen day period we will make a decision as to which way we want to go” that was march 22 and the pandemic lockdowns that many state and local governments have been lifting of late are now giving way to curfew orders following social unrest triggered by the death of george floyd at the hands of a minnesota police officer in the meantime unemployment numbers are rocketing upward and the despairrelated toll from booze pills and bullets is rising too so argues the doctor in an interview with realclearpolitics mccancekatz does not disagree that the initial lockdown was necessary to slow the coronavirus spread thus buying time for the medical community to handle the patient load and for researchers to learn how to defeat the pathogen but she now warns of dangers ignored by the politicalmedical community mental illness continues in isolation and in some instances accelerates this worries the doctor the uconn md and yale university phd insists that “it is time to move on” from the restrictions because just as too much medicine can be detrimental even deadly “when you only focus on one thing youre leaving out the entire spectrum of other illnesses that affect people” data for coronavirus deaths is easily accessible according to the centers for disease control more than 100000 americans have succumbed to the illness data for suicide and overdose deaths is forthcoming but there are troubling signs already calls to the disaster distress helpline the federal service that offers free counseling have increased 1000 during the pandemic each of the fifty us governors meanwhile have applied to secure the resources of the crisis counseling and assistance training program for their states and datapoints such as one coming out of knoxville tenn are heartbreaking nine suicides in one 48hour period “that number is completely shocking and makes me wonder if what we are doing now is really the best approach” knox county mayor glenn jacobs told local press “we have to determine how we can respond to covid19 in a way that keeps our economy intact keeps people employed and empowers them with a feeling of hope and optimism – not desperation and despair” this is what animates mccancekatz at a moment when visits to emergency rooms across the country are down overall those for suicide attempts are up “and what that tells us” she said “is that because we know that people are trying to avoid emergency departments because theyre afraid of the virus if youre being seen for a suicide attempt it was probably a very lethal attempt” will suicide deaths and those from substance abuse eclipse the coronavirus toll mccancekatz doesnt know but she suspects the worst a study by two doctors at the american academy of family physicians predicted that the number of people who kill themselves by their own hands or through excessive alcohol or drug consumption could range  depending on nine different economic recovery scenarios  between approximately 27000 and 154000 it doesnt matter how americans die though and thats the point the hhs official is making “all lives and all deaths are incredibly important” she said “we must not count a life lost to coronavirus as more important than a life lost to suicide for no other medical condition do we ever suggest that the level of death due to one condition means that we ignore the casualties caused by another” this makes the doctor a powerful advocate for americans suffering from mental illness and for a president who desperately wants the economy to reopen mccancekatz has briefed trump and vice president mike pence numerous times while urging all of the nations governors over conference calls not to forget about the less visible suffering of their constituents from the beginning trump has been receptive he wants businesses reopened and worries publicly about how a pandemic might make addiction even worse it may be personal his own brother struggled with alcoholism and died young asked in march about his message to those americans who were already alienated and suffering in silence before the pandemic trump told rcp that his message was simple “we love them were with them and we will not let them down” it has become a common refrain youre going to lose more people by putting a country into a massive recession or depression trump said during a fox news town hall in march youre going to lose people youre going to have suicides by the thousands fact checks disputing this followed but mccancekatz says the president wasnt far off she cites breadwinners who dont have a vocation accessible by home computer and for whom a missed car or mortgage payment can lead to a destructive downward spiral when one is isolated from normal societal interactions “it is unfortunate that the situation is such that the people who make these decisions are not people who have to really live with the decisions” mccancekatz said “the people who say ‘all businesses should close and people should still stay at home are the people who are collecting a paycheck every two weeks and who think that giving other people some sort of subsistence living is what americans want” she would like to remind those living in washington dc brownstones and new york highrises that “big lockdowns are not benign” she tries to tell them that for millions struggling with the bottle or an abusive spouse “home is not a safe space” slowing the spread of what trump calls “the invisible enemy” remains an important task she adds but the epidemiologistpsychiatrist warns that more negative social side effects from battling covid19 are on the horizon for americans stuck in lockdown “we are in uncharted territory”|2020-06-01|-0.9997|negative|0.02313476454101454|positive
new evidence shows that the shutdowns caused by covid19 could exacerbate existing achievement gaps|the us education system was not built to deal with extended shutdowns like those imposed by the covid19 pandemic teachers administrators and parents have worked hard to keep learning alive nevertheless these efforts are not likely to provide the quality of education thats delivered in the classroom even more troubling is the context the persistent achievement disparities across income levels and between white students and students of black and hispanic heritage school shutdowns could not only cause disproportionate learning losses for these students—compounding existing gaps—but also lead more of them to drop out this could have longterm effects on these childrens longterm economic wellbeing and on the us economy as a whole despite the enormous attention devoted to the achievement gap it has remained a stubborn feature of the us education system in 2009 we estimated that the gap between white students and black and hispanic ones deprived the us economy of 310 billion to 525 billion a year in productivity equivalent to two to four percent of gdp the achievement gap between high and lowincome students was even larger at 400 billion to 670 billion three to five percent of gdp although we calculate these two gaps separately we recognize that black and hispanic students are also more likely to live in poverty yet poverty alone cannot account for the gaps in educational performance together they were the equivalent of a permanent economic recession unfortunately the past decade has seen little progress in narrowing these disparities the average black or hispanic student remains roughly two years behind the average white one and lowincome students continue to be underrepresented among top performers we estimate that if the black and hispanic studentachievement gap had been closed in 2009 todays us gdp would have been 426 billion to 705 billion higher if the incomeachievement gap had been closed we estimate that us gdp would have been 332 billion to 550 billion higher exhibit 1 these estimates were made before schools closed and the transition to remote learning began sometimes chaotically in this article we explore the possible longterm damage of covid19–related school closures on lowincome black and hispanic americans and on the us economy to that end we created statistical models to estimate the potential impact of school closures on learning the models were based on academic studies of the effectiveness of remote learning relative to traditional classroom instruction for three different kinds of students we then evaluated this information in the context of three different epidemiological scenarios how much learning students lose during school closures varies significantly by access to remote learning the quality of remote instruction home support and the degree of engagement for simplicitys sake we have grouped highschool students into three archetypes first there are students who experience averagequality remote learning this group continues to progress but at a slower pace than if they had remained in school second some students are getting lowerquality remote learning they are generally stagnating at their current grade levels then there are students who are not getting any instruction at all they are probably losing significant ground finally some students drop out of high school altogether we also modeled three epidemiological scenarios in the first—“virus contained”—inclass instruction resumes in fall 2020 in the second—“virus resurgence”— school closures and parttime schedules continue intermittently through the 2020–21 school year and inschool instruction does not fully resume before january 2021 in the third scenario—“pandemic escalation”—the virus is not controlled until vaccines are available and schools operate remotely for the entire 2020–21 school year in our second scenario inclass instruction does not resume until january 2021 we estimate that students who remain enrolled could lose three to four months of learning if they receive average remote instruction seven to eleven months with lowerquality remote instruction and twelve to fourteen months if they do not receive any instruction at all exhibit 2 although students at the best fulltime virtual schools can do as well as or better than those at traditional ones most studies have found that fulltime online learning does not deliver the academic results of inclass instruction moreover in twentyeight states with around fortyeight percent of k–12 students distance learning has not been mandated as a result many students may not receive any instruction until schools reopen even in places where distance learning is compulsory significant numbers of students appear to be unaccounted for in short the hastily assembled online education currently available is likely to be both less effective in general than traditional schooling and to reach fewer students as well likely effects on lowincome black and hispanic students learning loss will probably be greatest among lowincome black and hispanic students lowerincome students are less likely to have access to highquality remote learning or to a conducive learning environment such as a quiet space with minimal distractions devices they do not need to share highspeed internet and parental academic supervision data from curriculum associates creators of the iready digitalinstruction and assessment software suggest that only sixty percent of lowincome students are regularly logging into online instruction ninety percent of highincome students do engagement rates are also lagging behind in schools serving predominantly black and hispanic students just sixty to seventy percent are logging in regularly exhibit 3 these variations translate directly into greater learning loss the average loss in our middle epidemiological scenario is seven months but black students may fall behind by 103 months hispanic students by 92 months and lowincome students by more than a year we estimate that this would exacerbate existing achievement gaps by fifteen to twenty percent in addition to learning loss covid19 closures will probably increase highschool dropout rates currently 65 percent for hispanic 55 percent for black and 39 percent for white students respectively the virus is disrupting many of the supports that can help vulnerable kids stay in school academic engagement and achievement strong relationships with caring adults and supportive home environments in normal circumstances students who miss more than ten days of school are thirtysix percent more likely to drop out in the wake of school closures following natural disasters such as hurricane katrina 2005 and hurricane maria 2017 fourteen to twenty percent of students never returned to school we estimate that an additional two to nine percent of highschool students could drop out as a result of the coronavirus and associated school closures—232000 ninthto11th graders in the mildest scenario to 11 million in the worst one in addition to the negative effects of learning loss and dropout rates other harder to quantify factors could exacerbate the situation for example the crisis is likely to cause social and emotional disruption by increasing social isolation and creating anxiety over the possibility that parents may lose jobs and loved ones could fall ill milestones such as graduation ceremonies have been canceled along with sports and other extracurricular events these challenges can reduce academic motivation and hurt academic performance and general levels of engagement the loss of learning may also extend beyond the pandemic given the economic damage state budgets are already stressed cuts to k–12 education are likely to hit lowincome and racial and ethnicminority students disproportionately and that could further widen the achievement gap the economic impact of learning loss and dropping out these effects—learning loss and higher dropout rates—are not likely to be temporary shocks easily erased in the next academic year on the contrary we believe that they may translate into longterm harm for individuals and society using the middle virus resurgence epidemiological scenario in which largescale inclass instruction does not resume until january 2021 we estimated the economic impact of the learning disruption the results would of course be worse in the third scenario and better in the first all told we estimate that the average k–12 student in the united states could lose 61000 to 82000 in lifetime earnings in constant two thousand and twenty dollars or the equivalent of a year of fulltime work solely as a result of covid19–related learning losses these costs are significant—and worse for black and hispanic americans while we estimate that white students would earn 1348 a year less a 16 percent reduction over a 40year working life the figure is 2186 a year a 33 percent reduction for black students and 1809 30 percent for hispanic ones this translates into an estimated impact of 110 billion annual earnings across the entire current k–12 cohort exhibit 4 of that sum 988 billion would be associated with loss of learning and the rest 112 billion with the increase in the number of highschool dropouts this is not just an economic issue multiple studies have linked greater educational attainment to improved health reduced crime and incarceration levels and increased political participation the damage to individuals is consequential but the consequences could go deeper the united states as a whole could suffer measurable harm with lower levels of learning and higher numbers of dropouts students affected by covid19 will probably be less skilled and therefore less productive than students from generations that did not experience a similar gap in learning

virtual meetings are becoming the norm under covid19 and winning over many researchers part three in a series on science after the pandemic|before the covid19 pandemic adam fortais had never attended a virtual conference now hes sold on them — and doesnt want to go back to conventional inperson gatherings thats because of his experience of helping to instigate some virtual sessions for the march meeting of the american physical society aps after the organization cancelled the regular conference at short notice “if given the option i think i would almost always choose to do the virtual one” says fortais a physicist at mcmaster university in hamilton ontario “it just seems better to me in almost all ways” fortais could get his wish since the coronavirus spread worldwide in early march many scientific conferences scheduled for the first half of the year have migrated online and organizers of meetings due to take place in the second half of two thousand and twenty are deciding whether they will go fully or partially virtual some researchers hope that the pandemic will finally push scientific societies to embrace a shift towards online conferences — a move that many scientists have long desired for environmental reasons and to allow broader participation scientists with disabilities and parents of young children are just two examples of the researchers who are benefiting from online meetings says kim cobb a climate scientist at the georgia institute of technology in atlanta cobb has been cutting back her own air travel since 2017 both to reduce her personal carbon footprint and to blaze a trail towards structural change in her discipline she hopes the changes as a result of the pandemic will last long after it has ended “in five years well be in a remarkably different place” but other researchers say that inperson conferences will once again dominate after the threat of covid19 has faded for them inperson meetings offer too many opportunities that virtual meetings cant replicate estimates of the carbon cost of conferences vary but range from 05 to two or more tonnes of carbon dioxide per participant in travel alone if each of the estimated 78 million researchers in the world travelled to one conference every year the lower bound of the annual carbon emissions would be roughly equivalent to those of some small nations sputnik moment or budget breaker how will the pandemic alter research funding before the pandemic many scientific societies had already begun exploring how to make virtual participation available for researchers who were unable or unwilling to travel when the crisis hit it forced them to speed up existing discussions and timelines “we were going to start out with smaller meetings” says hunter clemens director of meetings at the aps instead the society scrambled to move its annual april meeting online in a matter of weeks despite the accelerated timeline clemens says the virtual meeting was “something amazing” that gathering which took place on 18–21 april drew more than 7000 registrants — about four times more than its inperson attendance in a normal year says clemens and almost all of them — around 96 — logged on to the conference at some point the virtual sessions on average had higher attendance than inperson ones at standard aps april conferences attendees say that virtual meetings are better in certain respects submitting questions online through moderated chats for example can help graduate students to feel less intimidated and allow scientists to formulate better queries at the annual meeting of the american association for cancer research in april the ability of the audience to vote on questions in real time “resulted in a higher quality of question” says emily costa a cancer researcher at memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york city universities will never be the same after the coronavirus crisis adam tidball a physicist at rensselaer polytechnic institute in troy new york saw another benefit when he presented at the aps virtual april meeting “i found that the networking was a lot better than inperson” says tidball the conference provided attendees with a sort of matchmaking app for networking with which users could read other scientists biographies and reach out to them to initiate a conversation or schedule a time to meet virtually the economics of online meetings are different from those of conventional ones clemens estimates that the virtual april meeting cost only about 45 of the equivalent inperson conference although the society lost money on this years meeting because it had to make the shift so quickly and didnt charge for attendance the american astronomical society has had more time to plan its onlineonly meeting in june and the cost to attend is around 60 cheaper than it was for its january meeting but the shift to online meetings could shrink one of the major revenue streams for societies some of which draw a large fraction of their operating budget from their annual meeting and if societies move to hold a dual online and inperson meeting that could drive up costs because the meeting would require more staff and both a venue and an online platform researchers who have attended virtual meetings say that the meetings have several important downsides poster presentations can fall flat in an online space and its difficult to have serendipitous encounters between sessions which is where a lot of collaboration normally happens social scientist marzena świgoń says that unofficial chats during conferences are the most important way that scientists share knowledge with each other “i think that virtual conferences are only temporary” says świgoń who is at the university of warmia and mazury in olsztyn poland “as soon as the threat passes conferences will return in their traditional form” coronavirus and covid19 keep up to date anthony watkinson an information scientist at ciber research in newbury uk who has coauthored papers with świgoń is similarly sceptical of the permanence of virtual conferences he says that uk and us researchers overwhelmingly report that inperson interactions are necessary for forging relationships among many scientists however there is a clear mandate for at least providing the option to participate virtually in an informal survey conducted by nature roughly 80 of four hundred and eightysix respondents said they thought that some meetings should continue to be held virtually at least in some capacity after the pandemic has subsided now that the idea of a virtual meeting is less abstract cobb says people might be more willing to open up conferences meetings and seminars to remote participation “i do honestly believe there will be some remnants of this that

following are un secretarygeneral antónio guterres remarks to the yemen pledging conference in new york today|following are un secretarygeneral antónio guterres remarks to the yemen pledging conference in new york today i thank the government of saudi arabia for cohosting this pledging event and for your continued commitment to the humanitarian aid to the people of yemen and i thank the many governments and representatives demonstrating their solidarity with the yemeni people who have suffered so much and who now face the additional threat of covid19 more than five years of conflict have left yemenis hanging on by a thread their economy in tatters their institutions facing nearcollapse four people out of every five twentyfour million people in all need life‑saving aid in what remains the worlds largest humanitarian crisis two million yemeni children are suffering from acute malnutrition which could stunt their growth and affect them throughout their lives since the start of the year some 80000 more people were forced from their homes bringing the total displaced to almost four million cholera continues to threaten lives with 110000 people contracting it so far this year the recent floods have raised the risk of malaria and dengue fever on ten april the first confirmed case of covid19 was reported in yemen the pandemic poses a terrifying threat to some of the most vulnerable people in the world weakened by years of conflict and with a health system that is already on the brink of collapse since then reported cases are in the hundreds and are highly likely to be undercounted since testing rates are some of the lowest in the world there is every reason to believe that community transmission is already under way across the country we are in a race against time reports indicate that in aden mortality rates from covid19 are among the highest in the world that is just one sign of what lies ahead if we do not act now just half of yemens health facilities are operational there are shortages of testing devices oxygen ambulances and basic protective equipment many health‑care workers are among those who have contracted the virus even hospitals that are operational and equipped may not have a reliable electricity supply public health measures are particularly challenging in a country where trust in the authorities is weak and fifty per cent of the population do not have access to clean water to wash their hands tackling covid19 on top of the existing humanitarian emergency requires urgent action the pandemic is making it even more difficult and dangerous for humanitarian workers to reach yemenis with life‑saving aid we must preserve the major humanitarian aid operation that is already under way — the worlds largest — while developing new public health programmes to fight the virus and strengthen healthcare systems we have already made a start supporting rapid response teams across the country procuring essential supplies and working with front‑line health workers and communities to get information out to millions of people but we need to do much more this requires increased funding so far this year that has not been forthcoming we have never had so little money for aid operations in yemen this late in the year aid agencies estimate they will need up to 241 billion to cover essential aid from june until december including programmes to counter covid19 unless we secure significant funding more than thirty out of fortyone major united nations programmes in yemen will close in the next few weeks i thank those donors who pledged funding ahead of todays event and i urge all of you to pledge generously today — and to transfer pledged resources quickly there is no time to lose todays pledges will help our united nations humanitarian agencies and their partners on the ground to continue providing a lifeline to millions of yemenis they are also an essential part of any global plan to end the spread of the covid19 virus because it is clear that covid19 anywhere poses a threat everywhere this is the first virtual pledging conference for yemen but the fourth year in succession that we have called for urgent funding for this emergency ending the war is the only way to address the health humanitarian and human development crises in yemen civilian casualties have risen each month this year and more than five hundred people have been killed or injured since january that is why i issued a specific call for a ceasefire in yemen in march as the covid19 pandemic began to spread around the world i repeat my call on all parties to work with my special envoy and agree on the united nations proposal to achieve a nationwide ceasefire make progress on economic and humanitarian measures to alleviate suffering and build confidence and resume an inclusive yemeniled political process yemenis desperately need peace today is a day to demonstrate solidarity with some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the

financial crises could spell trouble for science budgets but spending could surge in some countries part two in a series on science after the pandemic|as the pandemics economic toll grows around the world some experts fear it could harm science for decades by putting many thousands of researchers out of work and forcing nations to slash funding as they rebuild societies others say the pandemic could highlight the importance of science and spur longterm support especially for basic research much as the second world war did in the united states where the rate of unemployment has risen towards levels last seen during the 1930s many science leaders are trying to make the case that supporting research and development is crucial “without science to help the country is in jeopardy” says harold varmus the nobelprizewinning cancer scientist who led the us national institutes of health nih between one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree and 1999 in the wake of the pandemic the biological sciences might thrive in the way that the one thousand nine hundred and fiftyseven launch of sputnik — the beachballsized soviet satellite that set off the space race — yielded decades of research and discovery in the physical sciences “researchers go where the money is” says julia phillips a member of the us national science board and former chief technology officer at sandia national laboratories in albuquerque new mexico the longterm economic consequences for science will vary significantly by country australia for example has warned that 7000 university research jobs are at risk this year whereas science remains largely intact in germany which is committed to investing an additional €17 billion us18 billion in science agencies through to 2030 at a steady 3 increase in budgets annually and although chinas economy and scientific momentum were slammed by the coronavirus the country is poised to recover relatively quickly its possible there could be a shuffling of priorities leading the country to invest more in biology and epidemiology says cong cao a sociologist at the university of nottingham campus in ningbo china some of the most drastic changes could come in the united states one of the worlds largest funders of scientific research and a country where spending decisions are made annually unlike some other nations several sciencepolicy specialists have been looking to the last economic shock the recession of 2007–09 for clues to the future after that downturn the us government doled out extra money to federal science agencies to jumpstart programmes as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act arra a national plan to boost activity across all sectors see ‘funding waves the nih for example received an extra us108 billion in two thousand and nine on top of the 30billion annual budget the arra fund was “an enormous amount of money” at the time says jennifer zeitzer director of legislative relations at the federation of american societies for experimental biology faseb in bethesda maryland the need this year is expected to eclipse that episode in early april a coalition of groups representing us universities asked congress to provide 26 billion to sciencefunding agencies to support the scientific workforce and the reopening of academic labs the funding could for example buffer delayed grants reestablish colonies of mice that had to be killed and replenish stores of personal protective equipment that were donated to the pandemic effort so far of the roughly 3 trillion in emergency money approved by congress nearly 4 billion has been directed at federal science agencies for coronavirusrelated work including developing vaccines and treatments groups such as faseb expect hiring freezes and lab shrinkages to hit earlycareer faculty members and graduate students particularly hard “what happens next obviously were very worried” zeitzer says universities will never be the same after the coronavirus crisis even in past economic crises us science has received steady support from the government and industry with total funding rising more than tenfold since the 1950s when adjusted for inflation the business sector accounts for some 70 of spending on basic applied and translational research but the us government remains the countrys biggest funder of basic science making an investment of around 121 billion in 2017 although congress has steadily increased federal dollars spent on science yearonyear a big economic shock could trip up that trend “then you can see a scenario where in fact the budgets for research agencies will go down” says elias zerhouni a physician who led the nih between two thousand and two and 2008 such a blow could tip the balance between basic and applied research in the past budget crunches have favoured experimental and applied science over bluesky research says phillips and if that were to happen now the united states could lose its competitive edge decades down the road “the horizon moves in” she says coronavirus and covid19 keep up to date but at a time when the coronavirus response has the attention of the public and lawmakers this could also be an opportunity for universities and scientists to ask for more says varmus “i think that the country is in a position now to appreciate what science has the potential to offer when the country is challenged moreover they have the ability to recognize the economic consequences of not being better prepared” in fact several us lawmakers have introduced legislation to dramatically boost funding for the national science foundation they propose giving the agency 100 billion over five years compared to its current annual budget of around 8 billion the chances of the plan becoming law remain unclear but zeitzer expects it would be a smaller amount if it did science in the united kingdom might fare better than in the united states in march the government announced a bold plan to increase research funding from £9 billion us11 billion a year to £22 billion by 2024–25 so far there are no signs that commitment will change says james wilsdon who studies science and technology policy at the university of sheffield uk “clearly if the overall financial outlook is seriously damaged in terms of a prolonged recession or depression then all bets are off”|2020-06-02|0.8789|positive|0.09164006132756132|positive
virtual meetings are becoming the norm under covid19 and winning over many researchers part three in a series on science after the pandemic|before the covid19 pandemic adam fortais had never attended a virtual conference now hes sold on them — and doesnt want to go back to conventional inperson gatherings thats because of his experience of helping to instigate some virtual sessions for the march meeting of the american physical society aps after the organization cancelled the regular conference at short notice “if given the option i think i would almost always choose to do the virtual one” says fortais a physicist at mcmaster university in hamilton ontario “it just seems better to me in almost all ways” fortais could get his wish since the coronavirus spread worldwide in early march many scientific conferences scheduled for the first half of the year have migrated online and organizers of meetings due to take place in the second half of two thousand and twenty are deciding whether they will go fully or partially virtual some researchers hope that the pandemic will finally push scientific societies to embrace a shift towards online conferences — a move that many scientists have long desired for environmental reasons and to allow broader participation scientists with disabilities and parents of young children are just two examples of the researchers who are benefiting from online meetings says kim cobb a climate scientist at the georgia institute of technology in atlanta cobb has been cutting back her own air travel since 2017 both to reduce her personal carbon footprint and to blaze a trail towards structural change in her discipline she hopes the changes as a result of the pandemic will last long after it has ended “in five years well be in a remarkably different place” but other researchers say that inperson conferences will once again dominate after the threat of covid19 has faded for them inperson meetings offer too many opportunities that virtual meetings cant replicate estimates of the carbon cost of conferences vary but range from 05 to two or more tonnes of carbon dioxide per participant in travel alone if each of the estimated 78 million researchers in the world travelled to one conference every year the lower bound of the annual carbon emissions would be roughly equivalent to those of some small nations sputnik moment or budget breaker how will the pandemic alter research funding before the pandemic many scientific societies had already begun exploring how to make virtual participation available for researchers who were unable or unwilling to travel when the crisis hit it forced them to speed up existing discussions and timelines “we were going to start out with smaller meetings” says hunter clemens director of meetings at the aps instead the society scrambled to move its annual april meeting online in a matter of weeks despite the accelerated timeline clemens says the virtual meeting was “something amazing” that gathering which took place on 18–21 april drew more than 7000 registrants — about four times more than its inperson attendance in a normal year says clemens and almost all of them — around 96 — logged on to the conference at some point the virtual sessions on average had higher attendance than inperson ones at standard aps april conferences attendees say that virtual meetings are better in certain respects submitting questions online through moderated chats for example can help graduate students to feel less intimidated and allow scientists to formulate better queries at the annual meeting of the american association for cancer research in april the ability of the audience to vote on questions in real time “resulted in a higher quality of question” says emily costa a cancer researcher at memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york city universities will never be the same after the coronavirus crisis adam tidball a physicist at rensselaer polytechnic institute in troy new york saw another benefit when he presented at the aps virtual april meeting “i found that the networking was a lot better than inperson” says tidball the conference provided attendees with a sort of matchmaking app for networking with which users could read other scientists biographies and reach out to them to initiate a conversation or schedule a time to meet virtually the economics of online meetings are different from those of conventional ones clemens estimates that the virtual april meeting cost only about 45 of the equivalent inperson conference although the society lost money on this years meeting because it had to make the shift so quickly and didnt charge for attendance the american astronomical society has had more time to plan its onlineonly meeting in june and the cost to attend is around 60 cheaper than it was for its january meeting but the shift to online meetings could shrink one of the major revenue streams for societies some of which draw a large fraction of their operating budget from their annual meeting and if societies move to hold a dual online and inperson meeting that could drive up costs because the meeting would require more staff and both a venue and an online platform researchers who have attended virtual meetings say that the meetings have several important downsides poster presentations can fall flat in an online space and its difficult to have serendipitous encounters between sessions which is where a lot of collaboration normally happens social scientist marzena świgoń says that unofficial chats during conferences are the most important way that scientists share knowledge with each other “i think that virtual conferences are only temporary” says świgoń who is at the university of warmia and mazury in olsztyn poland “as soon as the threat passes conferences will return in their traditional form” coronavirus and covid19 keep up to date anthony watkinson an information scientist at ciber research in newbury uk who has coauthored papers with świgoń is similarly sceptical of the permanence of virtual conferences he says that uk and us researchers overwhelmingly report that inperson interactions are necessary for forging relationships among many scientists however there is a clear mandate for at least providing the option to participate virtually in an informal survey conducted by nature roughly 80 of four hundred and eightysix respondents said they thought that some meetings should continue to be held virtually at least in some capacity after the pandemic has subsided now that the idea of a virtual meeting is less abstract cobb says people might be more willing to open up conferences meetings and seminars to remote participation “i do honestly believe there will be some remnants of this that

the company is treating a moral issue as if its a legal one|the interface is a daily column and newsletter about the intersection of social media and democracy subscribe here  on friday afternoon facebook made one of its most controversial content moderation decisions in company history after president trump posted to facebook some tweets that twitter had placed behind a warning for “glorifying violence” mark zuckerberg said that the company would allow them to stand “i know many people are upset that weve left the presidents posts up” zuckerberg said in a facebook post “but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies” “when the looting starts the shooting starts” trump had tweeted — quoting a former miami police chief who in 1967 called for a violent crackdown on the citys black community and just as the president suggested a long weekend of violence followed in the united states with police assaulting protesters and bystanders across the country in the days that followed zuckerberg said that facebook left the post up for two reasons one that “people need to know if the government is planning to deploy force” and two that trump had sort of maybe walked back his original post in a later one “saying that the original post was warning about the possibility that looting could lead to violence” so whether or not trump meant to incite violence with his words zuckerberg argued facebook had good reason to let the post stand shortly after sharing the post with the world zuckerberg held a meeting with employees to elaborate on his point of view in audio of the meeting that i obtained zuckerberg said that he had agonized over the decision “how to handle this post from the president has been very tough” said zuckerberg who was joined in the discussion by his head of policy management monika bickert “its been something that ive been struggling with basically all day ever since i woke up  this has been personally pretty wrenching for me” zuckerberg reiterated his unhappiness with trumps remarks “my first reaction  was just disgust” he said “this is not how i think we want our leaders to show up during this time this is a moment that calls for unity and calmness and empathy for people who are struggling” ultimately he and bickert said executives concluded that trumps remarks didnt violate their existing policies but he said they would reexamine their policies around politicians discussing the use of state force on facebook a process he said would likely take several weeks “there is a real question coming out of this which is whether we want to evolve our policy around the discussion of state use of force” he told employees friday “over the coming days as the national guard is now deployed probably the largest one that i would worry about would be excessive use of police or military force i think theres a good argument that there should be more bounds around the discussion around that” zuckerberg did not elaborate on what more “bounds” would mean in this case or whether he thought the policy should change to disallow posts like trumps in response to an employee question zuckerberg also said he disagreed with twitters approach of placing violating tweets behind a warning “if you really believe that a post is going to cause people to go to go do realworld violence then thats not the type of thing that i think we should have up even behind a warning” he said “some people might be comforted that twitter took a step even if it didnt go all the way but i dont personally agree with that step” zuckerbergs message to employees friday was that even if facebook hadnt removed this trump post it was prepared to do so in the future if the president violated a company policy that satisfied some employees but to others it smacked of appeasement on thursday their anger bubbled up in a series of internal threads as i reported at the verge and then over the weekend the longstanding norm that facebook employees never criticize their employer in public seemed to shatter tweet by tweet on monday they mounted the most significant collective worker action in the companys 15year history while its difficult to measure the number of people who participated in a virtual walkout an internal group devoted to the effort had about four hundred people sources said “im a fb employee that completely disagrees with marks decision to do nothing about trumps recent posts which clearly incite violence” tweeted jason stirman who works on research and development on saturday “im not alone inside of fb there isnt a neutral position on racism” jason toff a former employee of twitter and google who now works on experimental apps at facebook echoed those sentiments on sunday “i work at facebook and i am not proud of how were showing up” toff tweeted “the majority of coworkers ive spoken to feel the same way we are making our voice heard” within hours there were more than a dozen such tweets from employees working across the company all expressing disappointment with their employers decision and on monday dozens of employees staged a virtual walkout making themselves unavailable for the day and joining in protests the new york times reported that employees are working on a list of demands and that some senior employees have threatened to resign if zuckerberg doesnt reverse his decision “as allies we must stand in the way of danger not behind” tweeted sara zhang a product designer at facebook “i will be participating in todays virtual walkout in solidarity with the black community inside and outside fb blacklivesmatter” by this point we have seen our share of worker actions at big tech companies the google walkout over sexual harassment kicked open the doors in 2018 and has been followed by highprofile protests at amazon microsoft and salesforce among others and hundreds of facebook employees signed an open letter to zuckerberg in october about his decision to exempt political ads from factchecking but notable as that letter was it still adopted the form that dissent has almost always taken at facebook vigorous internal debate one source told me the internal furor over joel kaplans public support of controversial supreme court justice brett kavanaugh during his nomination hearings had been markedly more intense whats different about mondays walkout is that the protests were public first — and posted about on a rival social network to boot for facebook workers the choice to discuss their concerns on twitter was remarkably effective for two reasons one twitter is where journalists live and so the posts were guaranteed to generate coverage two sentiment about facebook on twitter is generally hostile so current employees criticisms of the company got massive distribution through retweets the workers comments were less sweeping in their criticism than some former employees cofounders and top executives of facebook have been over the years none of these employees has yet quit nor have they suggested as whatsapp cofounder brian acton once did that people “delete facebook” but what they shared was a sense of shame in their employer that remains extraordinary among tech workers even at a time when worker actions are becoming more common “facebooks inaction in taking down trumps post inciting violence makes me ashamed to work here” tweeted lauren tan an engineer “i absolutely disagree with it i enjoy the technical parts of my job and working alongside smartkind people but this isnt right silence is complicity” another inspired aspect of the workers protest was that executives had to sit back and accept it at least in their public statements you cant bend over backwards to allow the presidents posts about shooting up crowds and then tell employees they cant discuss their feelings about it and so the official word from facebook on all the controversy was that they should go for it “we recognize the pain many of our people are feeling right now especially our black community” the company told bloomberg “we encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership” much of employees frustration appears to be rooted in the fear that there is no line trump could cross that would lead facebook to enforce its policies zuckerberg and bickert spent much of the allhands meeting on friday pushing back on that idea — fairly i think it was barely two months ago that the company removed a post by the president of brazil jair bolsonaro for promoting a phony coronavirus cure you can argue that the company is more sensitive to pressure from conservatives in the united states and a lot of good reporting has borne that out in the past few years but the idea that theres no line trump cant cross on facebook doesnt strike me as plausible of course we wont know for sure until facebook actually does take action against trump and in the meantime a large number of employees have signaled that for them that red line has already been crossed for zuckerberg and his policy team trump is a legalistic problem — a question of how certain words and phrases do or do not comport with the standards they have written but for the workers speaking out trump is a moral problem — a danger to their friends their families their communities and themselves facebooks scale depends on courting republicans and democrats equally — making regular concessions to both to ensure that the platform is as large as it can be zuckerberg has sought to draw a distinction between his role as ceo and his own feelings — arguing for trumps right to free expression at work while donating 10 million to groups

why have republican leaders abandoned their principles in support of an immoral and dangerous president|not even trumps supporters can contest this analogy because the imposition of an alien ideology is precisely what he was calling for all along trumps first statement as president his inaugural address was an unprecedented assault on american democracy and american values remember he described americas capital city americas government americas congressmen and senators—all democratically elected and chosen by americans according to americas 227yearold constitution—as an “establishment” that had profited at the expense of “the people” “their victories have not been your victories” he said “their triumphs have not been your triumphs” trump was stating as clearly as he possibly could that a new set of values was now replacing the old though of course the nature of those new values was not yet clear almost as soon as he stopped speaking trump launched his first assault on factbased reality a longundervalued component of the american political system we are not a theocracy or a monarchy that accepts the word of the leader or the priesthood as law we are a democracy that debates facts seeks to understand problems and then legislates solutions all in accordance with a set of rules trumps insistence—against the evidence of photographs television footage and the lived experience of thousands of people—that the attendance at his inauguration was higher than at barack obamas first inauguration represented a sharp break with that american political tradition like the authoritarian leaders of other times and places trump effectively ordered not just his supporters but also apolitical members of the government bureaucracy to adhere to a blatantly false manipulated reality american politicians like politicians everywhere have always covered up mistakes held back information and made promises they could not keep but until trump was president none of them induced the national park service to produce doctored photographs or compelled the white house press secretary to lie about the size of a crowd—or encouraged him to do so in front of a press corps that knew he knew he was lying it takes time to persuade people to abandon their existing value systems the process usually begins slowly with small changes the lie was petty even ridiculous that was partly why it was so dangerous in the 1950s when an insect known as the colorado potato beetle appeared in eastern european potato fields sovietbacked governments in the region triumphantly claimed that it had been dropped from the sky by american pilots as a deliberate form of biological sabotage posters featuring vicious redwhiteandblue beetles went up all across poland east germany and czechoslovakia no one really believed the charge including the people making it as archives have subsequently shown but that didnt matter the point of the posters was not to convince people of a falsehood the point was to demonstrate the partys power to proclaim and promulgate a falsehood sometimes the point isnt to make people believe a lie—its to make people fear the liar read the saddest part of the anonymous ‘new york times oped instead anonymous concluded that remaining inside the system where they could cleverly distract and restrain the president was the right course for public servants like them anonymous was not alone gary cohn at the time the white house economic adviser told bob woodward that hed removed papers from the presidents desk to prevent him from pulling out of a trade agreement with south korea james mattis trumps original secretary of defense stayed in office because he thought he could educate the president about the value of americas alliances or at least protect some of them from destruction this kind of behavior has echoes in other countries and other times a few months ago in venezuela i spoke with víctor álvarez a minister in one of hugo chávezs governments and a highranking official before that álvarez explained to me the arguments he had made in favor of protecting some private industry and his opposition to mass nationalization álvarez was in government from the late 1990s through 2006 a time when chávez was stepping up the use of police against peaceful demonstrators and undermining democratic institutions still álvarez remained hoping to curb chávezs worst economic instincts ultimately he did quit after concluding that chávez had created a loyalty cult around himself—álvarez called it a “subclimate” of obedience—and was no longer listening to anyone who disagreed anne applebaum venezuela is the eerie endgame of modern politics in authoritarian regimes many insiders eventually conclude that their presence simply does not matter cohn after publicly agonizing when the president said there had been “fine people on both sides” at the deadly whitesupremacist rally in charlottesville virginia finally quit when the president made the ruinous decision to put tariffs on steel and aluminum a decision that harmed american businesses mattis reached his breaking point when the president abandoned the kurds americas longtime allies in the war against the islamic state but although both resigned neither cohn nor mattis has spoken out in any notable way their presence inside the white house helped build trumps credibility among traditional republican voters their silence now continues to serve the presidents purposes as for anonymous we dont know whether he or she remains inside the administration for the record i note that álvarez lives in venezuela an actual police state and yet is willing to speak out against the system he helped create cohn mattis and anonymous all living freely in the united states of america have not been nearly so brave i personally will benefit these of course are words that few people ever say out loud perhaps some do quietly acknowledge to themselves that they have not resigned or protested because it would cost them money or status but no one wants a reputation as a careerist or a turncoat after the fall of the berlin wall even markus wolf sought to portray himself as an idealist he had truly believed in marxistleninist ideals this infamously cynical man told an interviewer in 1996 and “i still believe in them” many people in and around the trump administration are seeking personal benefits many of them are doing so with a degree of openness that is startling and unusual in contemporary american politics at least at this level as an ideology “trump first” suits these people because it gives them license to put themselves first to pick a random example sonny perdue the secretary of agriculture is a former georgia governor and a businessman who like trump famously refused to put his agricultural companies into a blind trust when he entered the governors office perdue has never even pretended to separate his political and personal interests since joining the cabinet he has with almost no oversight distributed billions of dollars of “compensation” to farms damaged by trumps trade policies he has stuffed his department with former lobbyists who are now in charge of regulating their own industries deputy secretary stephen censky was for twentyone years the ceo of the american soybean association brooke appleton was a lobbyist for the national corn growers association before becoming censkys chief of staff and has since returned to that group kailee tkacz a member of a nutritional advisory panel is a former lobbyist for the snack food association the list goes on and on as would lists of similarly compromised people in the department of energy the environmental protection agency and elsewhere perdues department also employs an extraordinary range of people with no experience in agriculture whatsoever these modern apparatchiks hired for their loyalty rather than their competence include a longhaul truck driver a countryclub cabana attendant the owner of a scentedcandle company and an intern at the republican national committee the longhaul truck driver was paid 80000 a year to expand markets for american agriculture abroad why was he qualified he had a background in “hauling and shipping agricultural commodities” a friend told me that each time he sees lindsey graham “he brags about having just met with trump” while exhibiting “high school” levels of excitement as if “a popular quarterback has just bestowed some attention on a nerdy debateclub leader” i must remain close to power another sort of benefit harder to measure has kept many people who object to trumps policies or behavior from speaking out the intoxicating experience of power and the belief that proximity to a powerful person bestows higher status this too is nothing new in a one thousand nine hundred and sixtyeight article for the atlantic james thomson an american east asia specialist brilliantly explained how power functioned inside the us bureaucracy in the vietnam era when the war in vietnam was going badly many people did not resign or speak out in public because preserving their “effectiveness”—“a mysterious combination of training style and connections” as thomson defined it—was an allconsuming concern he called this “the effectiveness trap” the inclination to remain silent or to acquiesce in the presence of the great men—to live to fight another day to give on this issue so that you can be “effective” on later issues—is overwhelming nor is it the tendency of youth alone some of our most senior officials men of wealth and fame whose place in history is secure have remained silent lest their connection with power be terminated in any organization private or public the boss will of

devastating health impacts on pregnant mothers and inutero exposure to influenza is known to have negative short and longterm consequences for children this column however argues that the existing evidence from the covid19 pandemic allows for cautious optimism about the impacts of covid19 on pregnant women and their children more than 25 million women are currently pregnant in the united states and many are worried about the impact a covid19 infection might have on mothers and the development of their unborn children a large literature surrounding the foetal origins hypothesis has shown that pregnancy conditions not only impact the mother but can also impair the offspring almond and currie 2011 maternal influenza infections during pregnancy may induce premature birth currie and schwandt 2013 and strong cases may even impair foetal development to the point where repercussions throughout adulthood are observed schwandt 2019 in his seminal paper almond 2006 documented lower incomes and higher adult disability rates among the entire cohort of infants that was inutero during the spanish flu pandemic what about children born during the covid19 pandemic while at this moment it is still unclear whether maternal covid19 infections impair foetal development the existing evidence allows for cautious optimism the rate of reported covid19 deaths among pregnant mothers is low hantoushzadeh et al 2020 and while infections occur in pregnant mothers most are mild or remain asymptomatic sutton et al 2020 luo and yin 2020 children of mothers infected with covid19 during pregnancy are born without detectable impairments and typically test negative for the virus chen et al 2020 yu et al 2020 however it is too early to know whether inutero exposure to covid19 has negative longterm consequences that are not immediately visible at birth a potential reference point is the spanish flu pandemic aassve et al 2020 benmelech and frydman 2020 however it is important to keep in mind that the one thousand nine hundred and eighteen influenza virus had a very different more devastating impact – particularly for pregnant mothers figure one compares the age profile of covid19 mortality in new york city with spanish flu mortality in philadelphia one of the hardest hit cities during the spanish flu pandemic markel et al 2007 both mortality rates are shown per 100000 people but are plotted on different yaxes since covid19 deaths rates are likely to continue increasing in the ongoing pandemic figure one covid19 mortality in nyc and spanish flu mortality in philadelphia by age and gender notes data on covid19 death counts for new york city one february 202020 may two thousand and twenty cdc 2020 combined with population estimates for two thousand and seventeen nysdh 2017 data on spanish flu mortality from rogers 1920 covid19 mortality increases exponentially with age with extremely low death rates among infants children and young adults these numbers include recent cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome schroeder 2020 mortality is particularly low for young women among a total of 16493 covid19 deaths in new york city between one february two thousand and twenty and twenty may 2020 not a single female fatality occurred below age 25 for women between the ages of twentyfive and 34 only five out of every 100000 have died —and this figure is far lower than the rate for women sixtyfive or older where the data show more than seven hundred and forty deaths per 100000 for the spanish flu the age profile of deaths looked dramatically different fatalities were highly concentrated among infants and young adults among women the majority of deaths occurred in the fertile age range and mortality was especially high among pregnant women almond 2006 for every death there were many cases of severe illness with recorded stillbirths more than doubling during the pandemic rogers 1920 in other words pregnant mothers who survived the spanish flu experienced extreme levels of sickness in response to influenza infections during the pandemic this strong impact could not be more different from the current experience with covid19 infections which often go largely unnoticed in pregnant mothers this brings us to the last question in assessing the relative risks between the two pandemics for a developing fetus are mothers mild responses to covid19 infections good or bad for an infant in utero strong maternal reactions observed for influenza infections may drain the mothers body but they could be an efficient response eg to protect the fetus from contracting the virus itself however it turns out that the fetus does not usually get infected if the pregnant mother contracts an influenza virus or the covid19 virus ie the virus does not pass the placenta hence it is the strong maternal response to the influenza virus that impairs foetal development a strong immune system response of the mother can lead to broad inflammations in the pregnant body mcdade 2012 which fight not only the virus but also damage healthy tissue such as the placenta pregnant womens mild immune system response to covid19 is therefore a hopeful sign strong inflammations are also hypothesized to turn the mothers immune system itself against the fetus the fathers genes in the fetus are foreign to the mothers body and are only tolerated due to the mediation of helper cells surrounding the placenta trowsdale and betz 2006 a strong inflammatory response can compromise the functionality of these helper cells as a result the fetus might not only suffer from the inflammation itself but an inflammation can actually cause the mothers immune system to harm the fetus it remains unclear why pregnancy makes women respond so strongly to the influenza virus kay et al 2014 but it has been observed both for pandemics and seasonal influenza further the resulting infections have similar negative impacts on the offspring – both at birth as well as into adulthood almond 2006 creanga et al 2009 currie and schwandt 2013 schwandt 2019 it is important to emphasize that our understanding of the threats of covid19 is still far from complete we are learning from new research findings on a daily basis but there is room for cautious optimism from what we know so far covid19 seems to impact pregnant women less than influenza does while immune system responses triggered by maternal influenza have been shown to impair foetal development covid19 does not seem to cause such strong responses in mothers immune systems of course it is still possible that other impairments in the offspring may appear later even if they are not observable at birth and only time will tell whether infants exposed to covid19 during the first or second trimester will show signs of impairment at birth but so far the existing evidence allows for cautious hope that pregnant mothers and their offspring will fare much better during covid19 than they did during the last devastating global pandemic at the turn of the 20th century this is not to say that pregnant mothers and young children are entirely unaffected by the current pandemic food insecurity is on the rise schanzenbach and pitts 2020 and many young families face financial stress as unemployment is soaring to unprecedented levels conti 2020 nutritional economic and psychological stress during pregnancy is detrimental for the fetus as it increases the risk of poor health at birth which may in turn lead to negative longterm consequences aizer et al two thousand and sixteen almond et al 2011 persson and rossinslater 2018 hence we do not want to add unfounded anxieties about covid19 infections to mothers list of worries—as fewer worries might help their developing infants most this column first

coronavirus has delayed climate talks by a year but the planet doesnt have extra time so action on global warming cannot be postponed|the first conference of the parties under the united nations climate convention took place in berlin a quarter of a century ago by todays standards it was a relatively modest affair involving just a few thousand people including government officials scientists environmentalists and journalists by contrast the event scheduled for this year in glasgow uk — the 26th conference of the parties cop26 — would have attracted some 30000 participants but it has had to be postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak last week we learnt that the delay will last for a year with cop26 now due to take place in november 2021 the decision to delay was unavoidable a cop needs representatives of all countries to be present which would not have been possible if those countries were at different stages of virus transmission and lockdowns in glasgow the conference venue has been temporarily converted to a covid19 field hospital an online meeting was considered but rejected delegates rightly concluded that complex negotiations cannot be conducted using available virtualmeeting technologies but delay has risks and principal among them is slower progress in the struggle against climate change by the time cop26 was originally scheduled to begin countries were expected to propose new commitments to bring emissions to net zero and at the conference extra finance for lesswealthy countries was due to be proposed making good on decades of promises that have not been kept how the coronavirus pandemic slashed carbon emissions — in five graphs the role of carbon markets was also to be discussed along with nations responsibility for damages caused by global warming the meeting had a full agenda and a delay of a year will have consequences — ultimately making it even harder to limit temperature increases to 15–2 °c above preindustrial levels the main goal of the two thousand and fifteen paris climate agreement but countries do not need to wait until cop26 to take further action indeed there are signs that some are planning to focus more public investments on green infrastructure and clean energy rather than doubling down on a past marked by polluting fossil fuels it is the least they can do last week the european commission unveiled proposals for a €750billion us833billion postcoronavirus funding package that includes measures to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy technologies as part of a commitment to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050 the package will however need to be agreed by the twentyseven member states and the european parliament at the same time china announced that for the first time in decades it will not set a target for economic growth not setting such a target will enable policymakers to prioritize innovative ideas for improving the environment and wellbeing which can be difficult to do when a countrys principal policy focus is economic growth can the worlds most influential climate report carry on when it comes to the actual climate talks waiting another year does have one potential advantage many countries were unlikely to step up with ambitious climate plans this year even before the covid19 crisis complicated matters this is due in part to the uncertainty surrounding the united states intentions following president donald trumps decision to pull out of the paris agreement the us position is likely to become more predictable after us voters have delivered their verdict in the presidential election in november if the democrat candidate joe biden is elected the united states is expected to rejoin the paris accord and restore a more evidencebased approach to its climatechange decisionmaking it will also revert to engaging more constructively with other countries but if trump is reelected that will signal to other countries — especially those in the european union — that they should organize and press forwards with ambitious climate targets and funding pledges independently of the united states the latter scenario is likely to present the uk government with some challenges as it hosts cop26 along with next years meeting of the group of seven large industrialized countries as the united kingdom exits the eu it is loosening its ties to the eus many collective decisionmaking structures at the same time the government is in active talks with the united states seeking a closer relationship in areas including trade and research on climate policy the united kingdom could find itself trapped between a white house urging it to pay due attention to the us perspective and most other countries which will be advocating for action on the basis of the paris consensus british climate negotiators must do what is best for the planet and act according to the best available evidence five years ago countries came together in paris on a new agreement to curb greenhousegas emissions they knew then that their pledges fell short of what was needed and agreed to return to the table this year with new commitments a further delay of a year gives countries more time to plan for more ambitious reductions it also gives policymakers more time to think strategically as they work to bolster jobs improve livelihoods and ultimately build moreresilient economic systems the pressure is on and countries must continue to act with urgency they might think that they have carved out an extra year to prepare for cop26 but in practice there is no extra time the climate clock is still ticking and by delaying emissions reductions all countries have done is borrow against the planets future|2020-06-02|0.9978|positive|0.09801550862156921|positive

turnover this column reports on a firmlevel analysis across sixteen emerging markets and three western european comparator countries in order to gauge the potential risks associated with debtdriven covid19 support the overall goal is to prevent a wave of bankruptcies that could break valuable relationships between firms and their suppliers and employees however liquidity support in the form of additional bank lending may create debtoverhang problems in the future and therefore requires careful targeting over the past decade corporate leverage has increased considerably in many developing countries and emerging markets often exacerbating financial fragility alfaro et al 2019 policymakers who aim to alleviate corporate cash shortages during the covid19 pandemic therefore need to avoid overloading financially vulnerable firms with more debt this risk is real given that the most popular method of covid19 support to smes has been to provide these firms with more loans to gauge the potential risks associated with debtdriven covid19 support this column reports on a firmlevel analysis across sixteen emerging markets and three western european comparator countries our objective is to understand where ‘small and mediumsized enterprises smes are most in need of cash and liquidity and second where these firms still have room on their balance sheet to take on more debt where there is little or no such room further bank lending may come at the risk of a structural weakening of banks balance sheets galí 2020 our analysis is based on a firmlevel dataset that combines information from surveys conducted as part of the latest round of the ebrdeibworld bank enterprise surveys with data from orbis we use these data to estimate regression models of firms optimal capital structure or leverage defined as formal debt to total assets and separately their cash holdings defined as cash and cash equivalents to total assets the models clarify how firms precovid19 capital structures and cash buffers can be explained by basic firm characteristics such as their size profitability asset tangibility turnover variability and industry using these simple models we then calculate for each country how much the average small businesss cash buffer falls short of or exceeds the predicted cash buffer likewise we measure the available capacity for additional debt of the average sme firms with two hundred and fifty or fewer employees in each country figure one summarises these calculations the horizontal axis shows how sme cash holdings in countries such as croatia lithuania morocco serbia slovenia and ukraine fall short of the predicted value by between 37 of total assets in contrast the average small business in bulgaria czech republic latvia montenegro and slovak republic has greater than predicted cash buffers figure one excess leverage and cash holdings of the average small business source authors calculations based on data from es and orbis the vertical axis of figure one shows where small firms on average still have the capacity to borrow more for instance this is the case in countries like lithuania morocco and ukraine countries where smes seem to have an urgent need for more liquidity as well as in bulgaria montenegro and slovak republic countries with excess cash in contrast in countries such as bosnia and herzegovina croatia and slovenia as well as portugal there appears to be on average little room for more debt it should be noted that even the average sme in many of these countries appears to have had limited liquidity buffers at the time pandemic first broke out next using the same models we calculate for each country the proportion of smes that operate with lower than predicted cash buffers as well as the proportion of smes that entered the covid19 pandemic with relatively ample cash reserves likewise for each country we calculate the proportion of smes that had little room for additional debt and the proportion of smes that still appear in a position to absorb more debt figure two summarises these results more than 60 of smes in morocco and ukraine are both short on cash and have room to take on extra debt in contrast we again see high shares of small businesses in bosnia and herzegovina croatia serbia and slovenia that are short on cash but are already highly leveraged estonia and poland are similar in that about a third of all smes are short on cash but already have borrowed a lot figure two distribution of small businesses by precovid19 debt and cash structure source authors calculations based on data from es and orbis how long can small businesses survive with their existing cash buffers as a rough indicator we calculate the number of months that a small business can afford to pay its employees out of its existing cash reserves we then plot the distribution of businesses by different ‘survival horizons in chart 3 about half of all small businesses in ukraine have cash reserves of less than one months wages only around 20 of ukrainian smes have the liquidity to pay more than six months wages similarly most small businesses in montenegro russia lithuania and slovenia were likely to run out of cash reserves to pay their workers in less than two months where can credit access relieve liquidity constraints the most figure three also shows how the share of small businesses with liquidity constraints would change were they to ‘load up on debt to a level that our model would predict is normal given their other firm characteristics this shows for instance that additional lending to ukrainian smes could decrease the share of businesses with cash buffers that only cover up to one month of wages from 50 to 20 source authors calculations based on data from es and orbis our empirical analysis is rudimentary in the sense that it disregards certain firm and countryspecific determinants of corporate debt and cash buffers notwithstanding the analysis provides a straightforward and microfounded ‘traffic light system this can help diagnose in which countries firms needs for liquidity are most dire and as importantly in which countries these temporary cash shortages can safely be alleviated through more debt funding for instance in countries like bosnia and herzegovina croatia and slovenia there appear to be a relatively large number of firms in need of liquidity but there are also many firms that are already highly indebted in such countries efforts to support cashstrapped firms may take the following into consideration • decisions about whether to alleviate cash shortages through additional bank lending should ideally continue to be based on a casebycase assessment of individual firms debt capacity this in turn requires a view on whether the business was performing well before the pandemic or already had issues business exit remains an essential part of the process of creative destruction • where possible lending programs should require participating banks to make full use of existing credit bureaus and registries to ensure a complete picture of total outstanding debt this holds in particular for emerging markets with a history of episodes of excessive private sector borrowing and where information sharing among lenders has proven beneficial de haas et al 2020 • in countries where few firms have spare debt capacity smes may be better served by governmentsponsored initiatives to roll over existing debt rather than to provide fresh debt this may include temporary debt moratoriums and loanmaturity extensions • on a structural level many emerging markets will need to gradually rebalance their financial systems towards a greater use of equity instruments and a reduced reliance on debt ebrd 2015 in the short term interesting proposals have been made for a european pandemic equity fund boot et al 2020 such a fund would provide cashstrapped smes with cash flow injections in return for for instance a surcharge on future corporate tax payments in the medium term governments and multinational development banks can play a proactive role in stimulating a public and private equity culture in emerging markets for instance through improving research coverage and hence transparency of listed smes as part of the covid19 response financial resilience can further be rebuilt by selective equity investments in financially sound highgrowth and innovative small businesses with strong management already in place lastly in the long run policy makers could structurally reduce taxcode favouritism towards debt for instance by

mbandaka health zone mbandaka city equateur province the democratic republic of the congo all cases had experienced fever and bleeding prior to their deaths of the four patients who died two of them visited the general reference hospital hgr in wangata a sample swab was taken from one of them who died on thirty may safe and dignified burials were not performed for these four patients on thirtyone may the brother of the probable case who died on twentytwo may and his wife presented to hgr wangata both had fever nonbloody diarrhoea and vomiting they were placed in isolation after blood samples were collected the three samples including two blood samples and a swab were analyzed at a laboratory in mbandaka where all three samples tested positive for ebola virus disease evd by genexpert ebola assay one of the three samples swab was sent on thirtyone may 2020 to the institut national de recherche biomédicale inrb in kinshasa and tested positive for zaire ebolavirus using polymerase chain reaction pcr as of two june 2020 eight epidemiologicallylinked cases including two confirmed alive cases two suspected cases and four deaths one confirmed and three probable deaths have been reported the ministry of health moh officially declared the outbreak in equateur province on one june 2020 equateur province experienced an evd outbreak with fiftyfour cases and thirtythree deaths reported between eight may two thousand and eighteen through twentyfour july 2018 this is the eleventh outbreak of evd reported in the democratic republic of the congo since the virus was discovered in 1976 in the context of the current covid19 outbreak the health capacity and resources in the democratic republic of the congo are already strained and causing additional burdens on the national health system the risk of disruption to surveillance and routine public health activities due to covid19 might jeopardize the countrys ability to rapidly contain reemergence of these evd cases as of two june 2020 the democratic republic of the congo has reported three one hundred and ninetyfour covid19 cases and seventyone deaths who with the moh are implementing a coordinated rapid response to stop the spread of the outbreak and to identify any other suspect cases and initiate contact tracing indepth epidemiological investigation and contact tracing were initiated on thirtyone may 2020 the moh with support from who and partners have planned the following actions the laboratory capacity in mbandaka is being assessed and support is ongoing for appropriate setup and additional supplies safe and dignified burial activities could resume shortly following proper community engagement support for case management is also important to ensure provision of care to affected individuals who did not receive adequate evd funding since the start of 2020 and is currently using its emergency funds to support the epidemiological and public health interventions financial and human resources of the democratic republic of the congo who and partners are challenged by the ongoing covid19 outbreak who notes that the current resurgence is undesirable but not unexpected given the identification of wildlife spillover potential in africa accompanied by the high population density in the region and considering the sociological ecological and environmental drivers that could influence the emergence of evd there is a need for epidemiologists to conduct disease surveillance infection prevention and control ipc specialists vaccinators case management and laboratory staff and risk communication and community engagement experts materials for infection prevention and control ipc and personal protective equipment ppe coldchain reagents for laboratory diagnostics and means of transportation are required for the teams the area where the cases and deaths were reported is populated with poor and vulnerable populations known to be reluctant to social mobilization this might pose further challenges in terms of case investigation contact tracing safe and dignified burials and vaccination in the coming days additional challenges have been identified regarding • further investigations into this event to understand the extent of the outbreak • contact identification and tracing and identification of suspected cases • the covid19 context including lockdowns and nonavailability of flights the investigations are ongoing to assess the full extent of the outbreak and therefore high vigilance should be maintained this information will help define the risk in the coming days who advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce ebola virus disease transmission in humans • reducing the risk of wildlifetohuman transmission from contact with infected fruit bats or monkeysapes and the consumption of their raw meat animals should be handled with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing animal products blood and meat should be thoroughly cooked before consumption • reducing the risk of humantohuman transmission from direct or close contact with people with ebola symptoms particularly with their bodily fluids gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients at home regular hand washing is required after visiting patients in hospital as well as after taking care of patients at home • reducing the risk of possible sexual transmission based on further analysis of ongoing research and consideration by the who advisory group on the ebola virus disease response who recommends that male survivors of evd practice safe sex and hygiene for twelve months from onset of symptoms or until their semen tests negative twice for ebola virus contact with body fluids should be avoided and washing with soap and water is recommended who does not recommend isolation of male or female convalescent patients whose blood has been tested negative for ebola virus • continue training and retraining of health work force for early detection isolation and treatment of evd cases who continues to advise against any restriction of travel and trade to the democratic republic of the congo

the secretarygeneral welcomed the agreement between representatives of the government of venezuela and the advisory team of the national assembly on responding to covid19 he encouraged parties to respect humanitarian principles in implementing the accord …|the following is a nearverbatim transcript of todays noon briefing by stéphane dujarric spokesman for the secretarygeneral good morning good afternoon i think it is good afternoon just starting off — in his new policy brief entitled “covid19 and people on the move” the secretarygeneral argues that the pandemic presents us with an opportunity to reimagine human mobility for the benefit of everyone in a video message he said that the millions of people on the move — such as refugees internally displaced persons or migrants — now face three crises rolled into one they are confronted with the health crisis — but in a context where basics such as health care water sanitation and nutrition are often hard to find they also face a socioeconomic crisis although often without access to any social protection and people on the move also face a protection crisis and yet despite these challenges people on the move are contributing heroically on the frontlines in essential work the secretarygeneral added first recognizing that exclusion is costly an inclusive public health and socioeconomic response will help suppress the virus restart our economies and advance the sustainable development goals sdgs second we must uphold human dignity in the face of the pandemic and learn from the handful of countries that have shown how to implement travel restrictions and border controls while fully respecting human rights as well as international refugee protection principles and third no one is safe until everyone is safe and finally the secretarygeneral reiterated that people on the move are also part of the solution the policy brief and video message are online and we shared it with you also online are statements on the policy brief from iom international organization for migration unhcr united nations refugee agency and the un migration network and this morning the secretarygeneral spoke at an extraordinary intersessional summit of african caribbean and pacific states he said that we need a much stronger response of unity and solidarity if we are to get through this pandemic together and build a safer more stable future he warned that looming crises could contribute to the deepest global depression since the 1930s he welcomed the debt relief initiatives by the g20 group of 20 but added that they are not enough the secretarygeneral said that covid19 is exposing the fragility of our world and has laid bare deep injustices and inequalities based on income gender race and more returning to the systems that created this fragility is out of the question he said and he repeated his call for a vaccine to be made available quickly affordably and equally it must be seen as a global public good — as the peoples vaccine he added those remarks have been shared with you and tomorrow the secretarygeneral will have a video message on the global vaccine alliance gavi on the global vaccine summit which seeks to mobilize billions of dollars in funding he will laud what he calls the lifesaving miracle of a vaccination which is the most important public health intervention in history the secretarygeneral will stress that a covid19 vaccine again must be seen as a global public good — a peoples vaccine we need global solidarity to ensure that every person everywhere has access we will share the text of that message with you under embargo a short while later today and also on vaccines the united nations and the international red cross and red crescent icrc issued a joint call today for unity to scale up efforts to develop test and scale up production of safe effective quality and affordable diagnostics therapeutics medicines and vaccines specifically we are asking governments the private sector international organizations and civil society to unite towards a peoples vaccine for covid19 the vaccine should protect the affluent in cities and the poor in rural communities the old in care homes and the young in refugee camps a global social contract for a peoples vaccine against covid19 is a moral imperative that brings us all together in our shared humanity turning now to libya to update you on an announcement made yesterday the 55 joint military commission jmc resumed its work today three june with a meeting chaired by the acting special representative stephanie williams and that was obviously a virtual meeting she met by videoconference with the five members of the libyan national army lna delegation a similar meeting with the delegation of the government of national accord gna is expected to take place in the coming days negotiations will continue on the ceasefire agreement and associated arrangements on the basis of the draft presented by the un mission to both delegations on twentythree february of this year the un mission encourages the parties to deescalate consider a truce to enable improved delivery of humanitarian assistance and to refrain from incitement and create an environment conducive for negotiations and build trust between the parties we reiterated our concern by the persistent violations of the arms embargo on libya and call on all countries to strictly adhere to it in accordance with the relevant security council resolutions and turning to venezuela the secretarygeneral welcomes yesterdays announcement of an agreement between representatives of the government and the advisory team of the national assembly of venezuela on responding to the covid19 pandemic he encourages the main stakeholders to implement this agreement in accordance with the humanitarian principles of humanity neutrality impartiality and independence and to build on this foundation to continue seeking common ground to overcome the countrys protracted crisis the secretarygeneral recognizes the important role played by actors including the panamerican health organization paho in facilitating this agreement and i also want to give you an update on yesterdays pledging conference for yemen at the end of the day the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha tell us that thirty announcements of pledges had been made for a total amount of 135 billion this is significantly less than the 24 billion that aid agencies estimate they will need to cover needs from june until december including for the covid19 response closing the conference the emergency relief for the un mark lowcock said that unless we raise more money we face a horrific outcome in yemen he added that those who have not yet pledged including some major donors must now stand up and play their part while he added that those that have made pledges should provide the actual cash and money as soon as possible and our colleagues in un peacekeeping missions are continuing to support governments and local communities to respond to the pandemic in south sudan the un mission unmiss is helping to minimize congestion in the juvenile reformatory centre in juba while in torit we have provided personal protective equipment including thousands of masks glasses gloves and disinfectants to local hospitals in koch in unity state peacekeepers are working to combat misinformation by disseminating messages over loudspeakers and promotional trucks on how to protect yourself and others from the virus and in the central african republic the twelve peacekeeping field offices support local authorities by providing material such hygiene kits masks protective equipment as well as training in kaga bandoro in the central african republic peacekeepers supported the construction of a screening centre at the prefecture hospital and in berberati they assisted in the delivery of a tent which serves as a medical post and isolation quarters sensitization activities carried out in collaboration with womens groups and associations are ongoing the mission minusca has partnered with the diocesan centre for family to conduct a training workshop for covid19 for women leaders influential women community leaders were also trained through the missions female engagement team these capacitybuilding activities aim to better equip women to protect their families and communities from the virus mission members are also continuing their work with communities to promote peace the un mission along with local authorities religious leaders and representatives from youth and womens groups organized a workshop on the culture of peace and turning to some countrys specific examples in iran where there are more than 157000 cases of covid19 and more than 7900 deaths the un team led by the resident coordinator ms ugochi daniels has been working with the government and the people since the onset of the outbreak and this aims to respond to the health humanitarian and socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic the world health organization who team on the ground has provided arterial blood gas analysers virus test kits and other essential supplies to more than one hundred laboratories and hospitals it is also helping iran contribute data to the solidarity trial an international clinical trial to help find an effective treatment for covid19 which as you know was launched by the who and its partners who unicef united nations childrens fund and the un refugee agency along with the world food programme wfp have brought more than

insufficient sarscov2 testing has left many nations flying blind as they reopen their economies without adequate testing new infections could outrun control measures|covid19 has laid bare the weaknesses of clinical diagnostics infrastructures underfunded undervalued and underprepared laboratory testing has been overwhelmed by the contagion a combination of low reimbursement low margins low capacity and low investment has stifled innovation and competition costcutting centralization and regulatory rigidity have created backlogs and slowed the tracking of infections given the pivotal role of diagnostics in healthcare decisionmaking covid19 shows just how much clinical testing needs a radical rethink on may 28 the united states achieved a record 416664 tests for sarscov2 in one day around one test per thousand people per day the united kingdom france spain and much of the rest of europe are testing at a similar level given that only 3000 tests are carried out per day during a typical flu season we are approaching the limit of testing capacity using existing clinical laboratories and supply chains but it is nowhere near the level needed for countries to contain covid19 while reopening their economies according to the world health organization if more than 10 of results come back positive testing capacity is insufficient test positivity higher than 10 means many active infections are being missed nobel laureate economist paul romer has suggested thirty million daily tests are needed to reach the 10 positivity threshold in the united states the rockefeller foundation testing action plan projects five million tests by early june growing to twenty million in the following four months even the lowest estimates suggest 750000 to 900000 molecular tests will be needed every day — more than double what is presently available the massive scale of testing now needed is a result of government failure at the beginning of the outbreak to quickly implement testing tracking and tracing measures — together with social distancing — to limit the community spread of sarscov2 in those countries where lockdown was decisive and stringent tracking and tracing procedures were put in place — taiwan south korea hong kong and singapore — subsequent massive testing has been unnecessary elsewhere failed lockdowns and slipshod testing have gone hand in hand in the united states the centers for disease control botched its test rollout and the food and drug administration fda dithered on emergency use authorizations euas vacillating between oversight that was too stringent for rtpcr testing and too lax for serological testing the united kingdom abandoned broad testing and contact tracing in march then reversed its policy france planned widespread testing at the end of march then gave up on diagnostic testing when it became clear its clinical testing infrastructure couldnt deliver the shrinking number of public labs along with their centralization has meant results can take days if not weeks to come back — useless for tracking and tracing france has only fortyfive testing labs the united states just ninetyseven public labs with a commercial sector dominated by corporate giants like quest diagnostics and labcorp germany stands apart with a robust infrastructure of twenty national reference centers around forty ‘consultant laboratories and hundreds of hospital and clinicbased local testing centers results from the extended network are coordinated through a computer system adapted from germanys antibiotic resistance surveillance network heidelberg even has a ‘corona taxi program that transports medics in protective gear to check on patients in their homes in contrast testing in the united states is a mess with shambolic coordination at the national level existing providers have become swamped testing backlogs have lengthened and shortages of swabs supplies and reagents have grown as traditional labs failed to ramp up several research centers and hubs have stepped in and retooled to provide semiautomated ‘pop up labs for covid19 working with regulatory authorities and partnering with clinically accredited labs to innovate around reagent shortages one opensource effort recently won an fda eua for processing 10000 samples per day using automated loopmediated isothermal amplification circumventing rtpcr reagent shortages and aiming to provide results in twentyfour hours another idea is to use multiplexing schemes and nextgeneration sequencing to pool thousands of barcoded covid19 samples and then triage down to confirmatory testing for the identification of individual positives — an approach that enabled wuhan china to test 65 million people in nine days whatever technology is adopted with tests in such short supply strategic deployment to hotspots will be important in combination with contact tracing clinical centers essential services travel hubs nursing homes meatpacking plants and places of congregation bars nightclubs or religious gatherings will remain priorities with drivethru testing provided as an adjunct during reopening testing volume will most likely be built by employers symptom reporting and contacttracing apps built on apple and googles api will be used to identify workers to prioritize for testing drexel university and baylor college already offer such an app ultimately kits for doctors offices and athome testing will become available some perhaps even using crispr technology like those from mammoth biosciences or sherlock biosciences the failure of the clinical diagnostic sector to deal with the demands of a 21st century pandemic is a wakeup call the traditional players appear incapable of innovating around the problem — probably because innovation is alien in an environment where reimbursement cuts by the two thousand and fourteen protecting access to medicare act erosion of intellectual property protection and a lack of regulatory clarity has depressed profit margins and stunted investment but infectious disease is not going away and in an increasingly interconnected urbanized and globalized world covid19 has shown that present lab testing systems

companies in china that acted swiftly and decisively are likely to emerge stronger out of the covid19 crisis and will be better prepared to withstand the next major disruption|as the first country to suffer the outbreak of covid19 the chinese economy was severely affected with official statistics declaring firstquarter yearonyear gdp growth at negative 68 percent leading companies across sectors responded swiftly with a range of measures aimed at protecting their employees health and safety and engaged in creative ways to protect their business well before the outbreak subsided and lockdowns were lifted they worked hard to find ways to reactivate business activities identify new platforms for growth and position themselves to survive the crisis—and thrive beyond it some firms doubled sales during the crisis while others acquired tens of millions of new customers to understand what leading companies did to reactivate their business and adapt to a postcovid19 world we conducted a study of more than two hundred examples of initiatives taken by companies from across fifteen industries in china which we then sorted into thirty categories exhibit 1 these represent just a sample of the millions of microeconomic actions taken by individual companies that when viewed in the aggregate drove the acceleration of five major macroeconomic trends during the few months that covid19 “pressed the pause button” on the worlds secondlargest economy digitization declining global exposure rising competitive intensity maturing consumers and the stepping up of the role of the private and social sectors our research shows that companies that acted swiftly and decisively are likely to emerge stronger out of the crisis and will be better prepared to withstand the next major disruption on the other hand companies that were slow to respond or which responded with ineffective measures were more likely to suffer a bigger hit to their business department stores that failed to make the shift to digital channels while their online competitors experienced a rapid expansion on the back of demand for contactless commerce is just one example faced with immense pressure on their business some firms opted for shortterm solutions that backfired such as salary cuts without proper communications that destroyed staff morale and were leaked to the public and price increases aimed at recouping revenue losses but which ended up disappointing customers and turning them away in our research we also identified several enablers—most of which existed prior to the oubreak of covid19—that were essential to the success of the reactivation initiatives companies took these included a “throughcycle” mindset the ability to build a pool of financial reserves and secure required funding sufficient management capacity an agile organization adaptable technology infrastructure and teams of technology and digital experts among others for companies operating inside china these can serve as useful reference cases based on observations across sectors and as other economies around the world gradually lift lockdowns and people slowly get back to work the experience of companies in china could provide a reference for companies elsewhere in the world that are grappling with the same disruptions to their business and thinking through similar challenges to reactivating their operations and planning for the future while digitization may have been for some companies at least just a widely used buzzword before the covid19 crisis hit china once many cities were forced into lockdown businesses hoping to survive discovered just how essential it was to go digital companies in china pursued a variety of digitaltransformation initiatives including digitization of product offerings customer engagement and operations as well as rolling out new digitallyenabled working arrangements such as workfromhome and remote meetings sharing staff with other organizations and redeploying talent to keep them employed productive and safe even prior to the outbreak of covid19 chinas engagement with the rest of the world was undergoing a fundamental shift as the mckinsey global institute identified through its chinaworld exposure index chinas exposure to the rest of the world has declined over the past decade while the worlds exposure to china has increased on a relative basis the crisis has accelerated this trend with many companies doubling down on their china supply chain while others diversified their risk outside of china while china has long been marked by exceptional levels of industry competition the substantial decline in demand and the lockdown that gripped the nation between february and april notably increased its intensity while some companies suffered from the drop in demand and the disruption of supply chains other companies used this period to reposition themselves as even stronger players both during the crisis and beyond some firms turned the downtime into a platform for renewal and growth through refitting core assets and training employees while others adopted bold strategic moves aimed at shifting their competitive position experimenting with new technology and exploring ma china has experienced a gradual shift toward a consumptiondriven economy over the past decade in tandem with the vast expansion of the middle class and the evolution of consumer behavior and attitudes trends accelerated by the outbreak of covid19 companies in china pursued several initiatives to engage and adapt to the consumer during the crisis some firms doubleddown on serving customers implementing creative marketing tactics to stimulate demand and acquire new customers while making sure they were retaining their most loyal customers others redesigned their product and service offerings and changed their business models to meet the needs of current as well as future customers while the state sector continued to play an important role in handling the crisis the private and social sectors expanded their roles in addressing the crisis as employers of a large number of people with access to enormous resources privatelyowned firms pursued a range of initiatives that were essential in protecting employees their customers and the community at large the private sector along with socialsector institutions such as nonprofit organizations also worked handinhand with publicsector institutions to support initiatives aimed at protecting public health and maintaining employment companies in china have proven remarkably resilient throughout the crisis in the immediate aftermath of the crisis scores of companies across sectors have worked hard to recover lost business while keeping an eye trained on the future while some firms may never fully recover from the impact of the crisis several are surprisingly emerging stronger than ever perhaps as the rest of the world gradually reopens and resumes work the experience

corporations in asia have grown in scale but lag behind the global average on profits and the covid19 crisis poses new challenges|the covid19 crisis is an unprecedented global challenge in the post–world war ii period the pandemic has proven to be not only a publichealth crisis but also a major disruption to supply chains which may permanently change longstanding business practices in the next normal but asia has come through crisis periods before and emerged stronger for it—and there is reason to believe it can do so again the dynamism speed and agility of companies in asia have given the region resilience enabling it to achieve macroeconomic stability in a volatile world corporations in asia have grown rapidly and risen to global prominence over the past decade however bigger has not always meant better for economic profit net of the cost of capital a measure of value creation and companies ability to beat the market as a group companies in asia lag behind their counterparts in the rest of the world an external shock of the magnitude of the covid19 pandemic may accelerate the widening of the gap between underperforming and outperforming companies there are many opportunities for corporations in asia to build their ability to sustain longterm growth in what will be a more volatile context in the wake of the covid19 shock corporations can accelerate digital adoption and thereby unlock productivity build scale by exploring ma and continued regionalization and be bold and agile in the management of portfolios in addition business leaders need to manage for multiple time horizons putting in place planahead teams corporate asia has added scale however it has underperformed in economic profit over the past decade 1 of every 2 in new global investment went to companies in asia enabling them to scale up today they account for fortythree percent of the worlds largest companies by revenue however growth in scale and revenue has not overall translated into higher economic profit globally returns have fallen because of an abundance of cheap capital around the world economic profits fell from 726 billion in 2005–07 to a loss of 34 billion in 2015–17 asia experienced a swing in economic profits from 150 billion to a loss of 207 billion this was more than half the global deterioration three main factors explain asias declining economic profitability over this period the largest factor accounting for fortyfour percent of the decline was a cyclical downturn in energy and materials onethird of the drop can be attributed to the allocation of capital to valuedestroying sectors particularly in china exhibit 1 the remainder of the decline was because of the underperformance of companies in asia relative to their global peers mckinsey research on the power curve the relative performance of companies in generating economic profit found that the top and the bottom are pivotal spots for any company to occupy since those are where most value is created and destroyed the middle of the curve is the broad flatland where the majority of companies do not create or destroy economic profit the research mapped all companies in the global five thousand g5000 list on the power curve by country and sector overall asia is underrepresented at the top—the socalled superstar companies among the top quintile of global companies only sixteen percent are asian while twentyfour percent are north american companies in asia are also overrepresented in the bottom quintile of global companies making up twentyfour percent versus seventeen percent in north america in short asia has a higher concentration of companies that destroy economic value and a lower share of companies that create it patterns of strength and weakness depend on individual companies and the sectors in which they operate exhibit 2 • superstar companies in asia outperform in finance the top ten percent of financialservice firms in asia outperform those in the rest of the world overall companies in asia generated 43 billion in economic profit in contrast with the 52 billion loss in the rest of the world the significant economic profit generated by financialservices firms in asia was achieved despite the fact that the region has only half as many companies in the sector as the rest of the world chinas four largest banks alone contributed almost half the entire economic profit generated by all financial institutions in asia • superstar companies in asia underperform in consumer and knowledgeintensive sectors the biggest gap in economicprofit performance between large companies in asia and those in the rest of the world is found in highvalue consumer sectors technology and pharmaceutical and medical products although asia is well represented in these three sectors in sheer numbers the top ten percent of companies in the rest of the world substantially outperform the top ten percent in asia generating three to twenty times more economic profit • energy and materials companies in asia tend to match the global average in performance companies in the energy and materials sector face the challenges of cyclicality and overcapacity globally asias leaders in this sector perform similarly to their counterparts in the rest of the world companies in these sectors in asias emerging economies stand out they only represent thirty percent of companies in these sectors in the region but generated about half the economic profit created • asia has strong top performers in domestic services and capital goods but a long tail of underperformers in those sectors the gap between the top ten percent of companies in asia and their peers in the rest of the world is smaller than in other sectors—but asia also has many underperforming companies its bottom ten percent of companies in capital goods lost 79 billion 22 times more than those in the rest of the world companies in asia have a track record of resilience cyclicality capital allocation and underperforming companies may have eroded economic profit in asia but the region has proved its resilience in the face of shortterm volatility which could help companies emerge with relative strength from the covid19 pandemic the nations and companies of asia have weathered multiple crises and come out stronger once they passed mckinsey global institute mgi research on developing economies around the world singled out eighteen longterm and recent outperformers in part for their resilience and consistent growth—and asia dominates the list even countries in asia that were hit hard by the financial crisis of 1997–98 such as indonesia malaysia south korea and thailand returned to positive per capita gdp growth within a year or two in contrast middling and underperforming economies and regions such as some latin american countries and russia were laid low by events such as external debt shocks currency fluctuations and commodity slumps their recoveries were slower marked by prolonged periods of fiscal instability and high inflation companies in asia are resilient in part because they have to be they operate in highly dynamic markets that are growing rapidly—all against a backdrop of digital disruption and rapidly evolving consumer demands indeed contested leadership in asian markets is a vital piece of the puzzle that explains the success of the regions large companies in outperforming economies and by extension the success of the economies themselves today asia is being challenged to navigate through the covid19 crisis and its economic fallout the outbreak began in asia but so have containment strategies and new protocols at the time of writing in may 2020 asias response to the covid19 pandemic appears to have been relatively successful in reducing transmission and cases of infection in china and south korea although peak impact has not yet been reached in india or southeast asia in both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios mckinsey sees china returning to growth faster than the rest of the world a shock the magnitude of the current crisis has the potential to change business society and the global economic order in multiple ways in only around two months in early 2020 several wellestablished supply chains and business practices were completely disrupted some may recover and return broadly to the way they operated before the pandemic others may have been changed for good contactless commerce for example could become the permanent norm for consumers the pandemic may well be a proving ground that tests whether businesses can become more resilient to shocks more productive and better able to deliver to customers as asias corporate sector continues to mature expand internationally and push ahead with digital innovation the ability of the regions companies to adapt to whatever the postpandemic world brings could be enhanced asia could unlock 440 billion to 620 billion in economic profit the corporate ecosystems operating in asia today will be tested by the extent of the covid19 shock which could accelerate the destruction of value—but could also offer new opportunities for outperformers to pull further ahead in order to ascertain how corporate asia might generate greater economic profit we explored two levers combining the two companies in asia could potentially unlock 440 billion to 620 billion in economic profit exhibit 3 the first lever is improving performance at the company level more companies in asia at the bottom of the power curve need to move up and more need to move into the top quintile or solidify their position in it in other words more troubled companies need to turn around while middle and even top performers need to unleash more of their stillunrealized potential if asia were to match north americas powercurve distribution our simulations show that it could boost economic profit by 440 billion—a substantial prize but to do so about two hundred companies in asia would have to move from the bottom to the middle quintiles to create 180 billion|2020-06-03|0.9991|positive|0.1396438697754487|positive

the governments legal authority to respond quickly and aggressively to this unprecedented crisis today that acceptance is fraying as initial orders expire and states move to extend or modify them legal challenges have sprouted1 the next phase of the pandemic response will see restrictions dialed up and down as threat levels change2 as public and political resistance grows further legal challenges are inevitable the shape of these challenges is already morphing see table early cases alleged that stayathome orders violate individual rights some were broadgauged invoking constitutionally protected liberty but these consistently failed because of the entrenched precedent that general social and economic freedoms yield to public protection in a health crisis others have been smallerbore targeting particular domains that might have stronger constitutional protection such as churches abortion clinics courthouses election rallies gun shops and health facilities although a few of these have succeeded courts have quickly dispatched most recognizing that all settings require protection1 that legal landscape changed dramatically on may 13 in wisconsin legislature v palm the wisconsin supreme court completely struck the states renewed stayathome order ruling that the state secretary of health had imposed it improperly trial courts in ohio and oregon have ruled similarly ruling in favor of governors authority however are several michigan trial courts and the pennsylvania supreme court while public discourse about covid19–related restrictions remains focused on individual liberties these newer challenges assail public health officials fundamental authority to act without legislative approval or other procedural safeguards whats at stake in these cases and what are their implications for public health responses during pandemics the wisconsin decision is colorful it proclaims the need to guard against “tyrannical” government “overreach” and calls the secretary of health an “unelected and unaccountable bureaucrat” who “unilaterally” exercised “controlling subjective judgment” to “arrogate unto herself” a “vast seizure of power” despite this rhetoric the decisions core is a technical ruling that the health department didnt follow statutorily prescribed procedures nonetheless the majority suggested that not following these procedures amounted to more than a statutory violation without them the states public health emergency powers might be unconstitutional going further two justices wrote separately that even strict procedural compliance would not suffice because the legislature lacks constitutional power even in unanticipated emergencies to delegate authority for extended stayathome orders such a large delegation of authority they said violates the constitutionally required separation of powers by allowing the executive branch to create law although this ruling purports to address only the secretary of health in principle the separationofpowers objection also applies to the governor indeed challenges pending in several other states press this point against governors orders to prevent officials from trampling civil liberties during emergencies some checks on their power are essential but we believe the wisconsin court grossly misapprehended how such checks ought to function emergencypowers statutes necessarily expand executivebranch authority during declared emergencies by delegating legislative “police powers” to the governor and health officials3 one way to protect the public against abuses is to construe this delegation narrowly insisting that officials cant do anything the statute doesnt expressly permit a second approach is to require procedural steps before officials can issue orders a third is to hand the executive branch broad discretion but cabin its exercise through time limits or substantive standards reviewable by courts the wisconsin court strained to apply the first two approaches and gave the third short shrift first it held that the secretary of healths stayathome orders exceeded her statutory authority by going beyond the quarantine powers conventional focus on infected and exposed persons this ruling is deeply unsettling because public health experts have assumed that extensive “legal preparedness” efforts following previous crises assure that ample executive authority is on the books covid19 does present unprecedented challenges asymptomatic transmission coupled with the early lack of adequate testing required novel lastresort responses not explicitly anticipated by even the most updated public health statutes communitywide shelterinplace orders and business closures are more akin to powers governors or mayors exercise during civil unrest or natural disasters than in response to epidemics recognizing these realities other courts have accepted highly restrictive orders by construing the covid19 pandemic as a type of natural disaster or by relying on nonspecific public health provisions that permit all necessary measures the wisconsin court by contrast feared that interpreting existing statutes so broadly would hand an executivebranch agency too much power in doing so it ignored centuries of experience to the contrary second the wisconsin court held that the secretary of health was required to undergo a formal rulemaking process before entering statewide orders the majority characterized the stayathome order as a general “rule” which triggers a process of first notifying and receiving feedback from the public rather than a situationspecific “order” which does not the distinction can be fuzzy but the courts analysis was tortuously unforgiving it gave no weight to the orders temporary nature and seized on arguments the litigants hadnt made most perplexing instead of excising parts of the order that it found troubling eg criminal sanctions it struck the entire order — and refused to allow the time that all parties and even a majority of the justices wanted for rectifying defects procedural technicalities wont pose such formidable obstacles everywhere some states statutes automatically suspend all laws inconsistent with emergency orders and most others give governors emergency power to suspend normal procedures for conducting state business “if strict compliance    would in any way prevent hinder or delay” actions needed to address an emergency4 however about a dozen states including wisconsin allow suspension only of regulations not statutes — a distinction that could seriously handicap disaster response wisconsin allows abbreviated “emergency rulemaking” but that truncated process can still take several weeks a potentially devastating delay a recent study estimates that 89 of us deaths could have been averted if states had implemented stayathome orders two weeks earlier5 it is shocking to suppose that procedural niceties warrant such a death toll in contrast michigan trial courts have placed more emphasis on the third route to preventing abuses of power statutory constraints on executivebranch discretion emergencypower statutes usually specify that declarations are timelimited and subject to legislative override but some do not michigan has one statute of each type accordingly governor gretchen whitmer limited her initial order to twentyeight days but after the legislature declined an extension she imposed a second order under a different statute that required no time limit two michigan courts relied in part on the time limit to uphold the first order a subsequent decision upheld the renewed order pointing to three other statutory safeguards standards for what constitutes an emergency allowing other officials to weigh in and requiring that emergency orders meet judicially reviewable standards of being “reasonable” and “necessary” to address the threat michigan courts thus believed that the legislature when crafting emergencypowers statutes reckoned with the difficult tradeoff between preventing abuses of power and giving officials speed and flexibility to respond to unpredictable emergencies these courts took seriously various legislatively crafted safeguards that public health orders must satisfy such as time limits substantive standards and judicial review contorting a statutes language to demand additional procedural steps or omit needed authority — as the wisconsin court did — is neither valid nor necessary states have always had broad emergency powers and legislatures have carefully reevaluated these laws over the past twenty years after terrorist attacks natural disasters and epidemics ensuring that civil liberties protections are included though these statutes are being tested in new ways they have proved durable enough to protect against abuses of power their core framework — holding officials accountable for demonstrating that orders are reasonable and necessary — has been a robust scaffold for assessing the legality of public health orders for more than a century since it was announced in the seminal supreme court case of jacobson v massachusetts in addition to recognizing the need to give officials flexibility to implement forceful public health interventions jacobson recognized that administrative agencies are both nimbler and more expert than legislatures in upending this framework the wisconsin court did more than disrupt settled understandings of the law it hobbled the states ability to save lives|2020-06-03|-0.9957|negative|0.040147961092405544|positive
researchers expect longterm changes that reduce travel for work and conferences part six in a series on science after the pandemic|in midmarch nancy reid was settling into a sabbatical in australia when canadian prime minister justin trudeau called on all canadians to come home within days reid was on a flight back to toronto cutting short a threemonth stint meant to deepen collaborations with mathematicians in australia “we left with heavy hearts” says reid a statistician at the university of toronto reid and nine other researchers all visiting australia through a programme funded by the sydney mathematical research institute at the university of sydney flew home as borders began closing of the fifty planned visits by researchers to the institute thirty have been postponed or cancelled reid says that opportunities for her to take sabbaticals come around only once every half a dozen years “it could be a while before any of us take short hops to faraway places” the pandemic has forced researchers to grapple with how restrictions on their movement will affect the way science is conducted some fear that these limitations could lead to a world that favours elite scientists and established teams with less need to network while others lose collaborators and become marginalized and fieldwork becomes a luxury or the opposite could turn out to be true travel restrictions could help to democratize science if virtual working allows access to more connections for people who cannot easily travel many researchers will have to reimagine their projects in a world where travel is limited the pandemic might already be closing off some collaborations caroline wagner a science and policy researcher at the ohio state university in columbus has compared coronavirusrelated publications in the two years before december two thousand and nineteen with peerreviewed papers and preprints on the same topic posted between january and april 2020 wagner found that since the outbreak research teams — measured by the number of authors on a paper — have become slightly smaller and involve fewer nations coauthorship links between china and other scientifically dominant countries have strengthened whereas participation from developing countries has dropped off which wagner says suggests that researchers are working with those with whom they already have strong established connections she posted her teams results as a preprint on the socialsciences repository ssrn on eight may c v fry et al preprint at httpdoiorg102139ssrn3595455 2020 universities will never be the same after the coronavirus crisis the shift in favour of smaller networks is probably a byproduct of the need for speed international collaborations can enrich research and enhance creativity — but they take time to establish says wagner “if youre working on a crisis timescale then the transaction costs of adding new additional people is not going to be worth the price in time” if existing collaborations with developingcountry scientists are faltering then new ones could slow to a trickle even in areas outside coronavirus science says wagner the majority of relationships start with an inperson meeting she says “if people cant work side by side for short periods of time its going to dramatically cut international collaboration” earlycareer researchers who havent had the opportunity to make those interpersonal connections will be hit hard says richard woolley a sociologist at ingenio csicupv polytechnic university of valencia spain geographically remote countries such as australia are also exposed because of their highly international scientific workforce says keith jones a reproductive biologist at the university of adelaide data from the australian government show that around 35 of australias more than 65000 phd and masters students are from overseas a report by the australian academy of science published on eight may see gonaturecom2u2dznj estimates that some 9000 international students will not resume their research in the country this year owing to financial constraints or travel restrictions resulting from the pandemic such shifts can have longterm implications says cassidy sugimoto an information scientist at indiana university bloomington “as soon as you start down a research path and get into a pattern of collaborations it takes a long time to turn that ship around” at least in the short term some researchers will have to change the questions they ask and the projects they work on in a movementrestricted world as a programme director for the us national science foundation sugimoto says she has to consider how the research can be done without travelling “what happens if anthropologists can no longer go to their site do we still fund the research” sebastien kenmoe a virologist at the pasteur centre in cameroon in yaoundé leads a study on febrile illness in subsaharan africa he had to cancel a trip to the central african republic and is instead developing ways to monitor outbreaks including those of coronavirus remotely sputnik moment or budget breaker how will the pandemic alter research funding but for some disciplines there are no substitutes for international mobility since the pandemic jonah choiniere a palaeontologist at the university of the witwatersrand johannesburg has had to cancel several trips including ones to the united kingdom the united states and zimbabwe without access to fossils in other countries he plans to redouble efforts to collect data from universities and museums in south africa but it is a partial fix “i cant really completely function without international travel — its the backbone of my research” he says many researchers expect that travel for fieldwork will not be affected in the long term but choiniere says that the travel freeze — even if it doesnt last — will affect his productivity two years from now when the data from his cancelled trips would have been processed and sugimoto says that institutions will have to account for the greater impact of the pandemic on researchers in traveldependent disciplines when considering whom to promote but travel restrictions could also help to democratize research says choiniere “platforms like zoom talks and virtual scientific meetings level the playing field because they are inexpensive and nonexclusive and they can result in collaborations quite quickly” last week when one of his phd students presented an online lecture about her work on the dinosaur massospondylus an attendee based in argentina contacted choiniere asking to collaborate on projects during lockdown and to pursue more ideas after it ends researchers should consider ways to share data without requiring a physical presence says sugimoto this could help to improve access — both during and after the pandemic — to resources for people who are less mobile because of care responsibilities or disabilities “i hope that we can create moreethical spaces where we dont mandate mobility particularly for populations where that creates a burden” she says fewer flights could make research greener too grounded researchers might begin to reevaluate their work trips says woolley who used to fly every two weeks the research community has long grumbled about the climate impact of scientific travel he says “covid19 has brought an existential health threat into that mix” some travel is necessary for knowledge production but a lot of it isnt he says “conducting science responsibly should mean doing your best to reduce greenhousegas emissions and not contributing to the spread of a pandemic” researchers might well approach travel with more thought after the pandemic and thats no bad thing says reid “it seems unlikely to me that we will be as carefree about travel as we have been in the past”|2020-06-04|0.9707|positive|0.04459337584337584|positive
remote clinical trials and other changes could permanently alter pharmaceutical development part seven in a series on science after the pandemic|jonathan cotliar knew he was ahead of the curve four years ago when he joined science 37 a company that supports virtual clinical trials conducted mostly online the firm in los angeles california was growing slowly before march receiving about a dozen calls a week from potential clients but since the covid19 pandemic began science thirtyseven has been running at fever pitch cotliar the companys chief medical officer says science thirtyseven now receives hundreds of enquiries every week from potential clients such as pharmaceutical companies medical centres and even individual investigators with hospitals forming the epicentres of covid19 outbreaks around the world clinicaltrial participants have become reluctant to attend routine checkups and monitoring and healthcare workers are stretched beyond their capacity this has caused researchers to put many clinical trials on hold or to shift to a virtual trial structure by performing consultations online and collecting as much paperwork and data as possible remotely the pandemic might hasten the kind of change in clinical trials that cotliar and science thirtyseven were hoping to make anyway and there could be other lasting effects on drug development companies that are usually competitors are now collaborating and many are trying to make their supply chains more robust to deal with disruption some researchers and companies in the drugdevelopment field say the system might never be the same again the pandemic has touched nearly all aspects of the industry says kenneth kaitin director of the tufts center for the study of drug development in boston massachusetts “this has really turned upside down the whole drugdevelopment process” he says “the entire investigative world is focused just on developing treatments for covid19” scientists worlds will shrink in the wake of the pandemic some changes are likely to be temporary kaitin predicts drug regulators in the united states and other countries have acted fast to approve clinical trials of therapies and allow new uses of existing medicines to fight covid19 without demanding as much data and paperwork as they normally would such changes are likely to stick only for as long as the outbreak lasts “the flexibilities that are being granted for clinicaltrial development are being granted under the auspices of a publichealth declaration” says esther krofah executive director of fastercures a washington dc think tank “that to me is very much an emergency operation” and kaitin points out that these changes shave only a few months off the drugdevelopment timeline — crucial in the middle of a pandemic but unlikely to make a significant dent in the lengthy process of developing a therapy which can stretch out over years the pandemic could catalyse lasting change in other ways what might linger krofah says is the culture of collaboration across government industry and academia that has emerged during the outbreak “we have traditional competitors working together in new ways” she says an alliance of more than a dozen companies — including gilead in foster city california novartis in basel switzerland and wuxi apptec in shanghai china — has been working to discover and test antiviral treatments by sharing data about early results and basic science as well as collaborating on designs for clinical trials if these group efforts bear fruit they might continue says krofah pharmaceutical companies might also make longlasting adjustments to their supply chains says david simchilevi who studies operations management at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge over the past few decades drug makers have increasingly shifted their manufacturing away from the united states and europe to countries such as india and china which can produce the drugs at lower cost but over the past few years many firms have begun to look for ways to diversify their supplies of services and raw materials to reduce the risk of supply interruptions in the event of a us–china trade war says simchilevi the coronavirus outbreak could accelerate that trend “some shocks were anticipated but not at this scale” says krofah “this is going to cause a fundamental reexamination of that risk” momentum for a shift towards virtual clinical trials has been gradually building for years but progress had been hindered by a lack of clear guidance from regulators such as the us food and drug administration fda and a reluctance to invest in the technology needed to run such trials — until the pandemic hit says cotliar companies such as science thirtyseven are suddenly seeing their popularity skyrocket “its exponentially accelerated the adoption curve of what we were already doing” cotliar says “thats been a bit surreal” at the university of minnesota in minneapolis for example infectiousdisease specialist david boulware and his colleagues conducted a randomized controlled virtual trial of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to find out whether it can protect people who are at high risk of contracting covid19 the trial which included more than eight hundred people and found the treatment had no benefit d r boulware et al n engl j med httpdoiorgdxkv 2020 sent participants medicine by fedex delivery and monitored their health remotely patient advocates have long pushed for more virtual trials which ease the burden of clinicaltrial participation if the trend catches on it could speed up the enrolment of participants — a significant piece of the drugdevelopment timeline and now that the pandemic has driven medical centres to set up muchneeded technology and forced the fda to release guidelines for virtual trials during the pandemic it is hard to imagine clinical research going back to the way it was before says krofah “were going to see this as a new normal part of clinical research” she says “the cat is out of the bag”|2020-06-04|0.8999|positive|0.04774155137791502|positive

in bangladesh the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr confirmed today that a 71yearold rohingya man is the first refugee in the coxs bazar camp to die from covid19 and some thirty other people have tested positive so far yet …|the following is a nearverbatim transcript of todays noon briefing by stéphane dujarric spokesman for the secretarygeneral all right good afternoon i hope you can see me as tommy would say in the musical if you can see me you can hear me good afternoon and happy thursday which otherwise is known as dont forget to turn off your mics day starting off with the secretarygeneral this morning in a video message played to gavis vaccine alliance global vaccine summit the secretarygeneral noted that covid19 is the greatest public health crisis of our generation and he called for global solidarity to ensure that every person everywhere has access to the vaccine the secretarygeneral stressed the need to make three key commitments first he said we must find safe ways to continue delivering vaccinations even as covid19 spreads second we must use the networks of vaccine delivery to deliver a range of other primary health services and lastly when a covid19 vaccine becomes available we must make sure it reaches everyone this morning the security council heard a briefing on peacekeeping and was given presentations by the force commanders of the united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in mali minusma united nations mission in south sudan unmiss and from the un disengagement observer force undof also briefing today was the head of the department of peace operations jeanpierre lacroix he reminded council members that as the world is facing the challenges of covid19 so is peacekeeping he paid tribute to the peacekeepers civilian military and police who have shown dedication and commitment as they continue to carry out their mandates in the best way possible given the constraints imposed on them by the pandemic over the past few months he added peacekeeping operations have shown their capacity to adapt the peacekeepers response has been guided by four main objectives first protecting our personnel and their capacity to continue critical operations second containing and mitigating the spread of the virus third supporting national authorities in their response and fourth protecting vulnerable communities while delivering on mandate implementation the security council also adopted a resolution to establish the un integrated transition assistance mission in sudan or unitams it is never a good day at the un when we dont get another acronym – unitams the resolution says the new mission will assist the political transition progress towards democratic governance in the protection and promotion of human rights and sustainable peace the mission will also support peace processes and implementation of future peace agreements as well as assist peacebuilding civilian protection and rule of law in particular in darfur and the two areas the resolution also says that the mission will support the mobilization of economic and development assistance and coordination of humanitarian assistance also this morning the council extended the mandate of the african unionunited nations hybrid operation in darfur or unamid until thirtyone december of this year we have another update on the support provided by peacekeeping missions to the pandemic response in the countries where we operate in darfur in fact the unau mission there donated medical equipment and material to the zalingei teaching hospital located in central darfur the mission also supported the national prison authorities by disseminating information materials on virus prevention in places of detention through its rule of law division the mission worked on the development of contingency plans to handle virus cases in prisons including designating isolation areas in detention centres and in the central african republic work continues to implement the mandate of the peacekeeping mission minusca this week in bangui young recruits of the national gendarmerie received a training on genderbased sexual violence conducted by un police officers and turning to a couple of other countries where we are working with the government on containing the pandemic in mozambique the un and our humanitarian partners launched today two plans to respond to increasing humanitarian needs in the country the appeals seek over 103 million to support the governmentled response efforts the aim is to provide lifesaving assistance to more than 33 million people impacted by the humanitarian consequences of covid19 as well as recurrent climate shocks and the increasing violence in the cabo delgado province of mozambique in cabo delgado the rapid response plan will prioritize the urgent needs of more than 350000 people in the province including 211000 who have been displaced by the increasing violence the wave of armed attacks in the region since october two thousand and seventeen have escalated significantly since the beginning of the year and that is leaving tens of thousands of people without adequate access to food water sanitation or any basic services for the rest of the country 68 million is requested to support the health response to covid19 and also to provide humanitarian assistance as well as protection to vulnerable groups whose lives and livelihoods have been impacted by the pandemic and in the kingdom of eswatini where we have seen two hundred and ninetyfive confirmed cases of covid19 with two hundred and one patients having fully recovered and three deaths reported so far the un team there which has been led by resident coordinator nathalie ndongoshe continues to work with the government the people and partners to flatten the curve and address the impacts of the pandemic the world health organization who helped authorities update the covid19 response plan including boosting contact tracing ahead of schools reopening on one july who is preparing teachers and school staff on how to prevent and control the virus the un is also supporting the governments communications efforts to reach out to communities and families especially in hotspots across the country unicef united nations childrens fund has helped train more than 4000 community health volunteers and has also worked to improve health facilities accommodating covid19 patients with mobile showers toilets and handwashing facilities for its part the un childrens fund and the un development programme undp have donated dignity and basic hygiene packs water and sanitation supplies for children youth and women in prisons and other detention facilities for its part unaids joint united nations programme against hivaids has donated 5000 hygiene packs to people living with hiv to combat misinformation and share factbased verified information the un team is also working closely with senior editors and reporters in eswatini and from bangladesh the un refugee agency unhcr confirms to us that a 71yearold rohingya man is the first refugee in coxs bazar to die from covid19 the humanitarian community is deeply sad to learn this development and sends its condolences to the families and the wider rohingya community some thirty other people have tested positive so far but as testing is still ramping up its likely that the numbers are higher and there may have been others who have died of virusrelated health issues aid workers are striving around the clock to ensure that testing is available to refugees and that those who have covid19 have adequate facilities in place to care for them they are also working to ensure contact tracing and quarantine of those who may have been exposed unhcr has built isolation centres and stepped up its efforts to prevent the spread of the virus and more than 3000 refugees have also been trained in early warning alert and response procedures to identify and refer potential cases unhcr says that the joint response plan for the rohingya crisis is only twentysix per cent funded and our colleagues and friends at the un educational scientific and cultural organization unesco today say that they have joined their partners in the global action on disability glad to raise awareness on the urgent need to mitigate the impact of school closures due to covid19 on learners with disabilities as many as half of the estimated sixtyfive million primary and lower secondaryschool age children with disabilities in developing countries were already out of school before the pandemic started the secretarygeneral said that they face a lack of accessible public health information they also face significant barriers to implementing basic hygiene measures and to accessing health facilities he added that girls and women with disabilities in particular face greater risks such as domestic violence the food and agriculture organization fao said today that global commodity food prices fell for the fourth consecutive month in may as supplies appear strong and demand weakens due to economic contractions triggered by the pandemic the fao food price index averaged 1625 points in may — that is 19 per cent below the previous month it was the lowest reading of the index since december 2018 and today we mark the international day of innocent children victims of aggression we acknowledge the pain suffered by children who are victims of physical mental and emotional abuse the day also serves to reaffirm our commitment to protect children in line with the convention on the rights of the child and tomorrow is world environment day this years theme is “time for nature” in his message the secretarygeneral said that to care for humanity we must care for nature he stresses that we need our entire global community to change course and adds that as we work to build back better we need to commit to a green and resilient future and put nature where it belongs — at the heart of our decisionmaking this years host for the day is colombia the theme seeks to both educate the public about the value that our natural world provides|2020-06-04|0.9877|positive|0.13310015741833925|positive
i was cynical at first but its proved a powerful tool says ellen j wehrens|at the beginning of 2019 my laboratory began a happiness programme the principal investigator anne rios felt that she could not keep the 17member team happy and cohesive solely through her management everyone would have to take action towards achieving their own workrelated happiness to create an environment and team structure in which our personalities talents and ambitions could flourish while advancing our common research goal i am sure our initiative raised a few eyebrows here and there in our paediatriconcology institute — to be honest i was sceptical about it myself at first my concerns had mostly to do with the time investment given that our research field is already demanding and competitive however we learnt to use small tools and techniques that are not timeconsuming and the programme turned out to be prescient what weve learnt on our happiness journey is now helping us to cope with the stresses of working from home during the coronavirus pandemic coronavirus and covid19 keep up to date the programme was designed and led by herman bos a professional happiness coach it was intense but also highly versatile it started off at a personal level with individual homework assignments and onetoone coaching sessions once we had learnt about our own professional attitudes and preferred ways of working we moved towards teambuilding sessions to improve the organization of our group importantly the programme was designed to give us useful tools so that we would be equipped to keep boosting our professional happiness without external guidance we are now putting together our own tailored programme focusing on the areas we feel we could improve and benefit from most we began by taking an extensive online questionnaire the two hundred and forty questions and our responses to them were scored on the basis of the ‘big 5 personality traits openness extraversion conscientiousness altruism and neuroticism these each represent a range between two extremes extraversion for example includes introversion on the low end of the spectrum using the resulting personality reports we learnt about our own and each others personalities being aware of your own personality provides a unique opportunity to act out of character if you are an outgoing person say you can choose to give space in meetings for other people to comment or if you are naturally shy you can make an effort to speak up this hopefully creates a space where everyone has a chance to offer ideas opinions and criticism we were also taught how we could work together more effectively by keeping in mind each others distinct traits this could be as simple as reserving the quiet spots in our otherwise noisy office for members with a more introverted personality or as ambitious as trying to identify bigger issues underneath small annoyances the latter we accomplished in our ‘iceberg meetings aimed at exploring whats below the surface the motivations perceptions expectations and feelings that stir your behaviour these meetings are for colleagues who have difficulties interacting with each other and typically involve only two people the goal is to stop making assumptions based on what you see on the surface and to ask and openly discuss whats really going on and where conflict is coming from these meetings can be quite intense but they provide a powerful way to connect and create an open and safe atmosphere we also developed personal learning goals by recognizing specific areas in our professional routines that we wished to improve on and defining steps to achieve that we started working on these goals individually through homework assignments but kept finetuning them and evaluated our progress through onetoone sessions with the happiness coach and in group sessions i had recently joined the lab as a scientific writer after a postdoc position at the bench therefore my overall goal was to feel more comfortable and confident in this new role we learnt the hard way that being realistic was important design giant leaps instead of baby steps and you set yourself up for failure and disappointment for me that meant letting go of the idea of taking a demanding training course amid a continuum of deadlines instead i aimed to set aside small bits of personal time for development and growth we used defined tools to work towards our goals a ‘troika meeting for example is a forum designed to elicit immediate practical support from direct colleagues by boiling down a discussion to increase positive feedback colleagues come up with feedback and advice while the person seeking support is facing the other way this ensures that facial expressions are not part of the conversation which creates a neutral and focused environment at the end the person receiving support summarizes the advice they have taken from the session providing an opportunity to finetune and readjust their interpretation we ran a practice troika session for a colleague struggling with back problems who had arrived at a phase in her career where computer work dominated over lab work and pressure started to intensify we offered solutions including setting realistic goals to relieve pressure and writing down unfinished tasks at the end of the day to give a sense of closure even though the work is never done we found a simple and practical solution too ordering a standing office desk to help alleviate the back pain we also practised a stepbystep reflection process called the circle of eight amid all the peer support and group feedback i found this tool quite refreshing because its more individualistic it helps to develop personal control over a situation that is bothering you one of the first steps is to recognize and accept your situation from there you can ask yourself ‘what are my options for me step one was accepting that work taking over my personal life was not beyond my control rather i was making an active choice in prioritizing it with that i immediately felt better about the situation by no longer feeling out of control and powerless about it we also now use a simple score in our weekly lab meeting every person starts by stating their overall happiness level using a colour code green means you are happy red signifies that you are not doing well and yellow is somewhere in between you dont have to explain why you are a certain colour if you dont want to your mental state might be related to work but it might also be caused by events in your personal life whats important is that when we know each others state of wellbeing at the start of our week our lab meetings are on a monday morning we can act on it and keep expectations lower or try to support each other where we can this might seem simplistic but it has proved very effective in two ways first it provides an easy way to perceive how everyone is doing if a colleague is in the red we check in and see if we can help second it sends a clear and important message you are not invisible and your wellbeing matters to all of us thats also why we implemented a buddy system two lab members partner up and make an effort to take special notice of and responsibility for each others happiness this can be as simple as inviting your buddy for coffee when you see them in the red or continuous yellow our monday meetings colour sharing and use of other tools continue in virtual meetings during the coronavirus pandemic and all are helping us to stay connected and cope after i mentioned being yellow just once my buddy sent me an invitation for a virtual coffee chat this demonstrates the beauty of the system i am typically quite green so yellow to my buddy meant ‘coffee time to ensure that information travels fast and that we can act quickly if one of us is not doing well we expanded our buddy system to include three or four people who check in regularly on each other this is especially important with so many of our international group members living by themselves while their families are far away in other sometimes moreatrisk countries we are making sure that they are ok throughout this crisis and although we can never replace their actual family members we try to be their family away from home by using our colourcoded happiness scores and talking through what could otherwise be uncomfortable topics in our iceberg meetings weve created an environment in which we are truly connected to each other where we listen without judgement and where it is okay to share our anxiety although were now physically separated from each other these tools help me to feel that im still part of a solid and supportive team we are probably still a long way from returning to work as normal but we are in a strong position to resurface as the happy and supportive lab that we are|2020-06-04|0.9996|positive|0.16736614011448442|positive

understanding the biochemical interplay between virus and cell could help identify new ways to tackle coronavirus|in midmarch just after restrictions were put in place to slow the spread covid19 dr nigel stevenson looked out the window of his dublin apartment “it was a beautiful still evening the sun was setting and there was no traffic on the roads it was idyllic” he recalls “then i remembered why it was so quiet and i thought that damn virus” stevenson who leads the viral immunology lab in trinitys biomedical sciences institute knows more about “that damn virus” than most for more than a decade he has been working on diseasecausing viruses including hiv hepatitis c and more recently the coronaviruses sarscov1 from the outbreak in the early 2000s and mers from the outbreak in 2012 now he has turned his labs attention to the pandemic virus sarscov2 his interest the biochemical dance between an invading virus and the human cell it seeks to hijack and how understanding those interactions could help us design new therapies to stop infection “some viruses including the one that causes covid19 can hide from our immune systems early in the infection and they can really get entrenched” he explains “by understanding how they do that we could potentially bring the viruses out of hiding and help the immune system to clear the infection early on that would lead to less disease” when the sarscov2 virus – that causes covid19 – gets into our airways it enters our cells and ejects its genetic material coopting the infected cell into making copies of the virus which then go on to infect other cells one way our body defends us against this takeover is by releasing a substance called interferon stevenson explains “interferon is a really powerful defender because it activates hundreds of other genes and proteins that effectively stop the virus in its tracks” but some viruses can interfere with the interferon response stevenson and his trinity college dublin colleague prof cliona ofarrelly have previously shown the hepatitis c virus can block a particular pathway of biochemical signals inside the cell thereby stopping the cell from “telling” interferon to ramp up the molecular defences “we could see that the virus degraded this biochemical pathway inside liver and immune cells” explains stevenson “and this blockade meant the body wasnt able to switch on its normal defences against the virus” stevenson has found other viruses use a similar mechanism to block responses to interferon among them hiv “we have been able to show that hiv1 stops interferon too” he says “and we are looking at ways to prevent hiv1 from doing that and thereby restore the natural interferon response” then last year in a case of spectacularly good timing phd student yamei zhang in stevensons lab started to look at the effect of the original sars and mers coronaviruses on the interferon response “our ongoing studies are showing that both the sars1 and mers viruses use a conserved mechanism to block interferon” stevenson adds when covid19 became a serious public health concern the researchers also turned their attention to sarscov2 their analysis of the pandemic virus genome indicates that it too may use this process to suppress response to interferon as it has a similar interferonblocking code to the one stevensons lab has studied in its coronavirus “cousins” “we are now studying this because if this is one way through which sarscov2 evades our immune system then its good news for our battle against this deadly virus” says stevenson “our lab is already working on ways to restore interferons biochemical pathway so now we can apply these research discoveries to the pandemic virus too” another difficulty in covid19 is that when the immune system does respond to the virus later in the infection it can overrespond in some people damaging their lungs and other organs prof andrew bowie also at trinity is trying to figure out the pathway to this response like stevenson he has found himself in a good position to focus on sarscov2 “last year we started working with rna viruses that affect the airways trying to understand how these viruses trigger an immune response in lung cells” bowie says “and now we can pivot that work to look at how the rna virus sarscov2 does this” bowie along with ofarrelly and prof luke oneill are part of a european project called initiate which explores how diseasecausing viruses interact with human cells growing in the lab “we are looking at how the airway cells react to the viruses when they meet them and the kind of inflammatory immune response that follows” explains bowie “we and others have already discovered that viruses prompt a different kind of immune response in lung cells compared to the response we see to bacteria now we can look at how the inflammatory immune response gets switched on specifically in response to sarscov2 and what pathways are involved its a good example of how answering a basic biological question will shed light about what is going on in patients who experience this kind of immune activation in covid19” ultimately we want the answers to those biological questions to translate into better ways to prevent or treat covid19 dr virginie gautier at university college dublin is marshalling her labs resources to screen for such answers her expertise lies in hostvirus interactions and now she has reoriented her lab to look at sarscov2 “we are interested in the ways that cells respond biochemically to viruses so that we can identify points of vulnerability that could be targeted by drugs” explains gautier who is a principal investigator at the ucd centre for experimental pathogen host research “we also have a platform set up in the lab where we can apply specific drugs or other agents and see how that affects the virus when infecting the cells” with funding through the health research boards national covid19 rapid response call gautier is now working with ucd prof paddy mallon to screen for ways to block sarscov2 using that platform “we want to look at drugs that have already been approved for use in the clinic so they could be repurposed for treating sarscov2 if they are effective and we are looking at potential new agents against the virus too” gautier says her lab is also helping to provide reagents for hospitals to test patient samples for sarscov2 she adds “this pandemic needs us all to work together to use the insights and systems we have developed for other viruses and focus on this one”|2020-06-04|0.9904|positive|0.17818914956011728|positive

allelectricpowered society is just going back to a future where we might have been one hundred and twentyfive years ago the rapidly falling costs of renewable energy sources like solar cells and onshore wind turbines combined with improved storage methods should substantially reduce oil and gas use in electricity production offshore wind turbines have also fallen greatly in cost and increased in efficiency over the past two decades so that for the uk they offer a lowcost alternative with the incidental benefit of creating marine reserves and fish sanctuaries wind turbines are cheaper than natural gas combinedcycle turbines even before adding the costs of carbon capture and storage solar photovoltaics come next for the uk if carbon capture and storage is enforced though both wind and sun sources require large backup electricity storage systems for for example windless nights which well discuss below renewable energys share of overall uk electricity generation reached a peak of 605 at one stage in april 2020 according to national grid data coal use has fallen to near zero in the uk since the two thousand and eight climate change act without obvious aggregate costs hendry 2020 however natural gas usage has increased 35fold since the mid1980s and still contributes about one hundred and forty megatons mt pa to co emissions despite producing less than half those of coal per btu in 2019 the uk government amended the original climate change act target to zero net emissions by 2050 all sources of greenhouse gas emissions must go to a level such that carbon capture and storage possibly combined with atmospheric co extraction methods must remove the rest facing an irreducible nonzero minimum demand for oil and gas eg for chemicals to achieve zero net emissions before two thousand and fifty requires major technological change that almost certainly involves developing current research on avenues to remove wemyss 2014 or reuse existing co as a fuel stanford university 2019 ‘net zero is an excellent target but incredibly difficult to achieve and as yet there is no sensible uk strategy to do so – so we now suggest some speculative routes to meet the netzero target natural gas–use must be reduced to near zero like coal natural gas is mainly used for electricity production and household indoor and water heating the former could be handled in part by increased renewable sources household naturalgas and some oil usage could be reduced by increased taxes encouraging the adoption of solar panels and for example air heat pumps more radically the uk could switch back from a national gas distribution system using natural gas to one based on hydrogen possibly made by electrolysis when there is spare renewable electricity the uk had a hydrogenbased gas distribution system prior to 1969 but the switch to natural gas required all household equipment to be converted from ones that burned coal gas which is composed of about 50 hydrogen to those that burned natural gas which is mainly methane with everimproving technologies and cost reductions in renewable electricity generation a nearzero target for natural gas over the next thirty years should be possible without reducing gdp growth – perhaps even increasing growth with new opportunities however as no future technology is certain more research should be devoted to developing safe small modular nuclear reactors world nuclear association 2020 based on the welldeveloped nuclearpowered engines in submarines variants of small modular nuclear reactors such as moltensalt wasteburners httpswwwseaborgco may be able to use nonfissionable thorium or the ‘spent uranium fuel rods from older reactors helping to reduce the serious problem of transuranicwaste disposal part of those disposalcost savings should be put towards the building of small modular nuclear reactors perhaps supplemented by reallocating the £40 billion saved by abandoning the hinkley point c nuclear power station even over our horizon of thirty years nuclear fusion seems unlikely to be a key energy contributor despite many developments such as increasing output efficiency bennett 2017 and reducing internal damage to tokamak materials from helium galeon 2017 which might then be collected offsetting a potential shortage reducing oil use in transport to zero will take longer following current strategies even with more efficient engines diesel being phased out completely given its toxic pollutants and much higher taxes on gasoline without a major improvement in lithiumionbatterypowered electric vehicles their relatively short journey capacity despite taking a nonnegligible time to recharge discourages the replacement of internal combustion engines however recent advances have been made in understanding the properties of graphene with potentially large falls in its cost of production see ‘graphene in a flash from plastic waste williams 2020 graphene nanotubes can act as electrode supercapacitors and there may be something like a variant of moores law which states that processing power of computers doubles every two years that could lead to cost reductions stemming from a large increase in their production imagine sandwiching an array of graphene nanotubes sammed et al 2020 between two faraday cages in a prefabricated modular unit fitted to a vehicles roof perhaps even retrofitted on existing car roofs to power an electric motor so the vehicle becomes the battery graphene nanotubes seem capable of rapid charging and should be able to sustain viable distances on a single charge moreover if such electric vehicles are successful mandating them to be plugged in when not in use will translate into a vast electric storage system for no additional investment with cars acting as the national grids storage thus renewable sources of electricity could be widely adopted without worrying about the security of supply there are undoubtedly many technical issues that need to be solved before such a system could work in practice but there is much going on – such as developing 2dimensional trilayers of graphene grapheneinfo 2020 as an insulator superconductor and magnet several steps are possible for the uk to rapidly advance research on gnts 1 offer epsrc significant additional funding for a general call to research the topic 2 approach

patent to the uk government 4 contact major uk motor manufacturers of electric vehicles for interest and support 5 make the call more general as other light materials could play equivalent roles as sources of electricity other steps include research on smart meters to be able to register both payments for taking power from fast chargers and recording kwhs withdrawn from the grid and needing replaced for free and contemplating a grid of fast chargers the potential benefits of such a power source would be huge as a ‘sensitive intervention point farmer et al two thousand and nineteen cite the uks climate change act of two thousand and eight as a timely example with a large effect by not demonising road transport for its co footprint and dangerous pollution cars with internal combustion engines could be replaced at a rate matching obsolescence and the increased need for storage from the extension of renewables the basics of electric engines are established so employment can be maintained in vehicle manufacture and many of its ancillary industries rebased on graphene nanotubes two side benefits are a major reduction in both mining for lithium and later disposal or recycling of the resulting toxic battery waste and eliminating the need for expensive catalytic converters markedly cutting production costs eliminating a target for theft which then exacerbates air pollution

calls for an innovative mechanism to foster the development of a vaccine against covid19 governments would commit now to buy back any patent obtained by a private firm which would discover an effective vaccine at a price of €60 billion and would grant the right to produce the vaccine to any firm able to do so this mechanism would provide strong incentives to innovate while protecting firms from the political risk of expropriation on four may 2020 a pledging conference convened by the eu raised €74 billion in funding for covid19 vaccines treatment and diagnostic research leading funders included the european commission germany france the uk the world bank the bill and melinda gates foundation the global alliance for vaccines and immunisation – even the pop singer madonna as of fifteen may the covid19 pandemic has caused more than 300000 deaths throughout the world this pandemic may be the first major global event in the history of humankind all countries are hit and within each country entire populations are affected negatively by the pandemic itself or potentially positively by public interventions to fight against its diffusion for lockeddown countries production losses have been estimated at 30 of usual activity oecd 2020 eu countries pledged to donate €4 billion but each week of lockdown may cost €60 billion in foregone production some countries which have begun to soften their lockdown policies may have to reimpose strict measures at tremendous economic cost beyond the direct healthcare costs of the pandemic and the human costs of deaths and suffering the main economic consequences are not due to the virus itself but to policies aimed at flattening the curve in april 2020 half the world population was confined in some way according to the oecd 2020 the direct costs are already enormous the eu27 may have lost at least €280 billion in foregone production in the first month of lockdown baldwin et al 2020 and gourinchas 2020 observe the gdp loss could be tremendous if this lockdown triggers a fullscale recession one major issue with ending policies of containment is that we dont know if they will need to be reactivated in the near future successful lockdowns bring new infections to zero in a population but with a low share of individuals who have gained immunity in europe this share ranges from 04 in norway to 98 in italy flaxman et al 2020 this possibly underestimates true immunity but herd immunity requires levels of 50 to 66 there is a significant probability that new imported cases will trigger new epidemic waves in europe and so epidemiologists argue that suppression strategies will need to be maintained until vaccines or effective treatments become available walker et al 2020 even currently undefined and controversial policies that would seek to balance containment with the need to restart and maintain economic production may still induce substantial production losses such policies could be avoided if a vaccine were available and could be produced in large quantities early economic epidemiology papers have shown that complete eradication is very difficult to attain eg geoffard and philipson 1996 but many infectious diseases are kept under control today through vaccination if a sufficiently large proportion of the population is vaccinated we potentially achieve herd immunity by this route even if a vaccine fails to eradicate covid19 it will be a major tool to reduce prevalence the economic gains from the rapid creation and manufacture of a vaccine have been noticed by investment fund managers the financial times reported on twentyfour april that blackrock fidelity international aviva investors janus henderson and amundi all wanted drug companies to collaborate with their competitors to speed up its availability according to le et al 2020 and the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations one hundred and fifteen vaccine candidates were in development on eight april although even in the most optimistic case this development will take more than a year researchers and their employers may be motivated by the desire to contribute to human wellbeing – but money may be important too if only because it allows innovators to throw more people and resources at the research those financial incentives to innovate are generally determined by the expectation of a temporary patent monopoly though the four may conference was indeed a great success the total amount pledged so far still represents only a small fraction of the economic costs induced by the pandemic though a substantial share of that amount will be targeted towards vaccine research this research is also sensitive to the political risk of expropriation an example one week after the conference paul hudson ceo of sanofi said that the subsidy granted by the us biomedical advanced research and development authority to finance its vaccine research programme came with a commitment by sanofi to give priority for a vaccine to us customers in response french authorities and members of the european parliament countered that any vaccine would have to be equitably available to all many meps went further and expressed support for compulsory licensing of any vaccine vaccine research takes time and resources and is a risky enterprise the chance is high that even if a vaccine is discovered by a pharmaceutical firm political pressures will prevent this firm from making profits by the usual route of obtaining a patent and selling the vaccine at a high price for a covid19 vaccine the social and political pressures for an exception to patent protection will be considerable it is hard to believe that some if not most countries will not invoke article thirtyone of the trips agreement enabling a government to use compulsory licensing to allow a local firm to produce a patented product without the consent of the patent owner or to import the product from another country under trips governments must still pay an adequate fee to the patent holder but if the emergency is extremely urgent they dont need to try to agree a voluntary license in short a government can impose its own price its a safe bet that covid19 satisfies these conditions and so for a private firm the risk of expropriation seems particularly important even if governments do not activate compulsory licensing political pressures and healthcare budget constraints mean that firms will be under pressure to lower prices many major pharmaceutical companies are already dedicating risky research efforts to find a vaccine against covid19 reducing investment in other drugs or vaccines but these holdup risks may reduce their effort stockholders may gripe if theres a risk that a firm will succeed but not be granted a patent or that it gets a patent but is unable to recoup rd spend kremer et al 2020 and athey et al 2020 have argued for advanced market commitment this was intended to foster research on diseases common in developing countries but it could apply here donors pledge to top up payments for newly introduced vaccine meeting technical benchmarks conditional on the firms setting the price close to marginal cost three pneumococcal vaccines have been developed encouraged by such a pledge and one hundred and fifty million children in poor countries have been immunised saving an estimated 700000 lives but if production costs are difficult to observe the commitment to sell at marginal cost is impossible to verify this generates a political risk ngos campaigning for lower drugs prices and transparency in pricesetting would put pressure on any patentholder to reduce prices even those claiming to sell at production cost a more standard way to come close to marginal cost pricing is to rely on competition between producers however since competition brings profits to zero financial incentives for research must come from another instrument one way to get around these issues while providing incentives for vaccine research would be for donors to pledge to buy the patent at a high value they would then allow private firms to produce the vaccine without having to pay any patent fees the patent would have high value but it can be thought as a way to frontload the costs that would be borne in future by health insurance schemes which in european countries are mostly funded by payroll taxes – revenues from which have already been severely damaged by the drop in economic activity baker 2020 if pledged by the eu such a commitment would also speed up the availability of the vaccine as the producer will not have to negotiate a price in each country governments could even set up such a scheme as an option offered to pharmaceutical firms the patent holder could still decide to remain the owner of the patent and to negotiate market access and prices with each healthcare financing institution this could be financed by the recovery fund announced by the european commission which according to the european parliament could be as large as €2 trillion a commitment by the eu to buy a vaccine patent would be a clear and transparent mechanism that would reduce the political risk of expropriation could foster investment in rd and will speed up market access we could argue that an investment that could hasten the end of containment by just one week in europe would be socially profitable if it costs less than €60 billion this amount provides a lower bound for the social value of a vaccine a commitment to buy for say €60 billion seems an enormous sum but if this shortens a future lockdown by a single week it would be an efficient use of public money athey s m kremer c snyder and a tabarrok 2020 “in the race for a coronavirus vaccine we must go

the european central bank ecb is the central bank of the nineteen european union countries which have adopted the euro our main task is to maintain price stability in the euro area and so preserve the purchasing power of the single currency|christine lagarde president of the ecb luis de guindos vicepresident of the ecb frankfurt am main four june two thousand and twenty jump to the transcript of the questions and answers ladies and gentlemen the vicepresident and i are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference we will now report on the outcome of todays meeting of the governing council which was also attended by the commission executive vicepresident mr dombrovskis incoming information confirms that the euro area economy is experiencing an unprecedented contraction there has been an abrupt drop in economic activity as a result of the coronavirus covid19 pandemic and the measures to contain it severe job and income losses and exceptionally elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook have led to a significant fall in consumer spending and investment while survey data and realtime indicators for economic activity have shown some signs of a bottomingout alongside the gradual easing of the containment measures the improvement has so far been tepid compared with the speed at which the indicators plummeted in the preceding two months the june eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections see growth declining at an unprecedented pace in the second quarter of this year before rebounding again in the second half crucially helped by the sizeable support from fiscal and monetary policy nonetheless the projections entail a substantial downward revision to both the level of economic activity and the inflation outlook over the whole projection horizon though the baseline is surrounded by an exceptional degree of uncertainty while headline inflation is suppressed by lower energy prices price pressures are expected to remain subdued on account of the sharp decline in real gdp and the associated significant increase in economic slack in line with its mandate the governing council is determined to ensure the necessary degree of monetary accommodation and a smooth transmission of monetary policy across sectors and countries accordingly we decided on a set of monetary policy measures to support the economy during its gradual reopening and to safeguard mediumterm price stability first the governing council decided to increase the envelope for the pandemic emergency purchase programme pepp by €600 billion to a total of €1350 billion in response to the pandemicrelated downward revision to inflation over the projection horizon the pepp expansion will further ease the general monetary policy stance supporting funding conditions in the real economy especially for businesses and households the purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time across asset classes and among jurisdictions this allows us to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy second we decided to extend the horizon for net purchases under the pepp to at least the end of june 2021 in any case we will conduct net asset purchases under the pepp until the governing council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over third the governing council decided to reinvest the maturing principal payments from securities purchased under the pepp until at least the end of 2022 in any case the future rolloff of the pepp portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance fourth net purchases under our asset purchase programme app will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion together with the purchases under the additional €120 billion temporary envelope until the end of the year we continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the app to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates and to end shortly before we start raising the key ecb interest rates fifth we intend to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation sixth we decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged we expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to but below 2 within our projection horizon and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics together with the substantial monetary policy stimulus already in place todays decisions will support liquidity and funding conditions in the economy help to sustain the flow of credit to households and firms and contribute to maintaining favourable financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions in order to underpin the recovery of the economy from the coronavirus fallout at the same time in the current rapidly evolving economic environment the governing council remains fully committed to doing everything necessary within its mandate to support all citizens of the euro area through this extremely challenging time this applies first and foremost to our role in ensuring that our monetary policy is transmitted to all parts of the economy and to all jurisdictions in the pursuit of our price stability mandate the governing council therefore continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner in line with its commitment to symmetry let me now explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis the latest economic indicators and survey results confirm a sharp contraction of the euro area economy and rapidly deteriorating labour market conditions the coronavirus pandemic and the necessary containment measures have severely affected both the manufacturing and services sectors taking a toll on the productive capacity of the euro area economy and on domestic demand in the first quarter of 2020 when containment measures were only in place from midmarch in most countries euro area real gdp decreased by 38 quarter on quarter information from surveys highfrequency indicators and incoming hard data all point to a further significant contraction of real gdp in the second quarter most recent indicators suggest some bottomingout of the downturn in may as parts of the economy gradually reopen accordingly euro area activity is expected to rebound in the third quarter as the containment measures are eased further supported by favourable financing conditions an expansionary fiscal stance and a resumption in global activity although the overall speed and scale of the rebound remains highly uncertain this assessment is also broadly reflected in the june two thousand and twenty eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area in the baseline scenario of the projections annual real gdp is expected to fall by 87 in two thousand and twenty and to rebound by 52 in two thousand and twentyone and by 33 in 2022 compared with the march two thousand and twenty ecb staff macroeconomic projections the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised substantially downwards by 95 percentage points in two thousand and twenty and revised upwards by 39 percentage points in two thousand and twentyone and 19 percentage points in 2022 given the exceptional uncertainty currently surrounding the outlook the projections also include two alternative scenarios which we will publish on our website following this press conference in general the extent of the contraction and the recovery will depend crucially on the duration and the effectiveness of the containment measures the success of policies to mitigate the adverse impact on incomes and employment and the extent to which supply capacity and domestic demand are permanently affected overall the governing council sees the balance of risks around the baseline projection to the downside according to eurostats flash estimate euro area annual hicp inflation decreased to 01 in may down from 03 in april mainly on account of lower energy price inflation on the basis of current and futures prices for oil headline inflation is likely to decline somewhat further over the coming months and to remain subdued until the end of the year over the medium term weaker demand will put downward pressure on inflation which will be only partially offset by upward pressures related to supply constraints marketbased indicators of longerterm inflation expectations have remained at depressed levels while surveybased indicators of inflation expectations have declined over the short and medium term longerterm expectations have been less affected this assessment is also reflected in the june two thousand and twenty eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area which foresee annual hicp inflation in the baseline scenario at 03 in 2020 08 in two thousand and twentyone and 13 in 2022 compared with the march two thousand and twenty ecb staff macroeconomic projections the outlook for hicp inflation has been revised downwards by 08 percentage points in 2020 06 percentage points in two thousand and twentyone and 03 percentage points in 2022 turning to the monetary analysis broad money m3 growth increased to 83 in april 2020 from 75 in march strong money growth reflects bank credit creation which is driven to a large extent by the acute liquidity needs in the economy moreover high economic uncertainty is triggering a shift towards money holdings for precautionary reasons in this environment the narrow monetary aggregate m1 encompassing the most liquid forms of money continues to be the

ferocious in his critiques of racism – not least as he experienced it in the ‘liberal publishing world the last time we met a week before his trip to seattle he was wearing a malcolm x cap and carrying a wellworn copy of william gaddiss novel the recognitions on eight july after a breakfast with the democratic presidential candidate and former basketball star bill bradley joe went to mount rainier to do some birdwatching he never returned the most likely explanation is that he fell down a ravine and lost consciousness he had a heart condition but washington is a very white state and some of his friends and family suspected racist foul play at the time i doubted this now im not so sure one of his friends told a reporter that he hadnt packed any provisions because he was only ‘going out for a couple hours … sort of like going to central park i thought of joe when i read about christian cooper the black birdwatcher who crossed paths with a white woman and her dog in central park on the morning of twentyfive may the same day george floyd was killed when a police officer in minneapolis knelt on his neck for nine minutes there are ‘white spaces in central park and the ramble a wooded area popular with birdwatchers is one of them cooper is fiftyseven – almost exactly the age joe would have been – a harvard graduate a member of the audubon society and a civil rights activist he politely asked the woman to put her dog on a lead as is required in the park she refused and grew increasingly aggressive eventually calling the police to report that ‘theres an african american man … threatening me as web du bois wrote in a one thousand nine hundred and thirtytwo essay for the crisis ‘nothing in the world is easier in the united states than to accuse a black man of

more reason to complain of white men in this respect than ever white women have had of negroes one of the engines for maintaining the supply of slave labour was the rape of black women the fact that christian and amy cooper have the same surname is a reminder that many white and black americans have mixed ancestry but the idea of the violent rapacious black male is deeply embedded in the american unconscious and cooper tried her best to tap into it even if this time the strategy backfired she lost her job at an investment firm and her dog but her performance provided an extraordinary demonstration of the way the myth of white female fragility is used against black men later that day in minneapolis there was a harrowing demonstration of black fragility which is all too real and has been magnified by the covid19 pandemic the ‘crime that cost george floyd his life was reportedly buying a packet of cigarettes with a counterfeit 20 bill no wonder if he did he was one of the forty million americans who have lost their jobs since the pandemic began derek chauvin the white police officer who knelt on floyds neck for eight minutes and fortysix seconds as he complained he couldnt breathe and called for his dead mother had faced at least seventeen previous misconduct complaints and taken part in three police shootings one of them fatal his three fellow officers also applied pressure to floyds neck and protected chauvin while he stared defiantly at a woman filming the incident police officers in minneapolis are seven times as likely to use force against blacks as against whites while the citys population is only twenty per cent black they represent sixty per cent of those subjected to physical force on the part of the police in his letter from harlem in 1960 ‘fifth avenue uptown james baldwin writes that the police officer moves through the inner city the killing of george floyd falls into the gruesome pattern baldwin described but its also different and the difference helps explain why the explosion has spread to three hundred cities and developed into a near insurrection the black lives matter movement which emerged during the obama presidency succeeded in drawing attention to police violence against black people but the protests against the killings of trayvon martin michael brown and freddie gray were mostly confined to the cities in which the deaths had occurred obama was seen as sympathetic to blms concerns even if he offered little more than memorable speeches floyds death not only follows the killings of breonna taylor an emergency medic shot dead while asleep in bed in her home in kentucky by police officers looking for drug dealers operating out of a different house and ahmaud arbery a jogger murdered by a group of men who claimed to be making a ‘citizens arrest a term that harks back to slavery when any white person could arrest any black person but it took place under a president who has made white supremacy a pillar of his administrations domestic and international outlook white nationalism has found expression not merely in trumps defence of the charlottesville white nationalists as ‘very fine people or in the building of the wall against migrants from mexico and central america but in his attack on ‘shithole countries and his decision to remove the us from the world health organisation in the middle of the pandemic – ‘white flight translated into foreign policy and then theres the pandemic itself floyds murder came just as the us death toll exceeded a hundred thousand an alarming number of those who have died have been people of colour especially black people many of whom suffer from preexisting health conditions and dont have access to adequate healthcare covid19 has made clear how little black lives matter in the us even as it has underscored the countrys dependence on black and brown ‘essential workers who provide care deliver packages and prepare food – all lines of work that have exposed them to the virus the growing awareness that covid19 is a ‘black plague as the princeton academic keeangayamahtta taylor has called it has inspired a call to action among civil rights activists but many whites especially in red states have responded with demands to end the shutdown trump cheered on the armed and unmasked white protesters in michigan who seized the state capitol and advocated

brazen voter suppression reopened the new york times ran a frontpage photograph of a black woman in a white mask serving coffee to a white man without a mask at a lunch counter a reminder that jim crow hasnt so much died as been reconfigured the message of such scenes was that whites had no reason to concern themselves with a ‘black plague except to make sure the help was taking precautions the method of floyds killing is no less significant it almost doesnt matter whether chauvin intended to kill him he didnt care whether he lived or died trump did not kill floyd but he has fanned the politics of white supremacy and sanctioned the humiliation of black americans it is this assault on floyds dignity as well as his person that has provoked the most serious challenge yet to trumps presidency trump ran in part on his opposition to costly overseas engagements but hes no pacifist and has always looked at domestic politics as a theatre of combat opponents are to be bullied and if they cant be bullied crushed nothing has infuriated him as much as challenges from people of colour it was after all obamas mockery of him at the white house correspondents dinner in two thousand and eleven that made him decide to run some on the left drew a strange consolation from trumps hostility to foreign wars as if it meant he could be a tactical ally against american imperialism they failed to see that he wanted to wage war at home his furious inauguration speech with its talk of ‘american carnage was a declaration of war on urban racial liberalism especially as represented by new york the city that had rejected him trumps outlook was formed during the bitter racial conflicts of new york city in the koch and giuliani years when bluecollar whites – joined by many ‘liberal members of

many of the secrets uncovered werent particularly significant or indeed very secret in themselves they dont explain the degree of rage wikileaks provoked in the us government and its allies this was a response to julian assanges assault on their monopoly…|julian assange​ was running wikileaks in two thousand and ten when it released a vast hoard of us government documents revealing details of american political military and diplomatic operations with extracts published by the new york times the guardian der spiegel le monde and el país the archive provided deeper insight into the international workings of the us state than anything seen since daniel ellsberg gave the pentagon papers to the media in 1971 but today ellsberg is celebrated as the patron saint of whistleblowers while assange is locked in a cell in londons belmarsh maximum security prison for twentythree and a half hours a day in this latest phase of the american authorities tenyear pursuit of assange he is fighting extradition to the us court hearings to determine whether the extradition request will be granted have been delayed until september by the covid19 pandemic in the us he faces one charge of computer hacking and seventeen counts under the espionage act of 1917 if he is convicted the result could be a prison sentence of one hundred and seventyfive years i was in kabul when i first heard about the wikileaks revelations which confirmed much of what i and other reporters suspected or knew but could not prove about us activities in afghanistan and iraq the trove was immense some 251287 diplomatic cables more than 400000 classified army reports from the iraq war and 90000 from the war in afghanistan rereading these documents now im struck again by the constipated militarybureaucratic prose with its sinister dehumanising acronyms killing people is referred to as an eof ‘escalation of force something that happened frequently at us military checkpoints when nervous us soldiers directed iraqi drivers to stop or go with complex hand signals that nobody understood what this could mean for iraqis is illustrated by brief military reports such as the one headed ‘escalation of force by 38 ne fallujah i civ kia four civ wia decoded it describes the moment when a woman in a car was killed and her husband and three daughters wounded at a checkpoint on the outskirts of fallujah forty miles west of baghdad the us marine on duty opened fire because he was ‘unable to determine the occupants of the vehicle due to the reflection of the sun coming off the windshield another report marks the moment when us soldiers shot dead a man who was ‘creeping up behind their sniper position only to learn later that he was their own units interpreter these reports are the small change of war but collectively they convey its reality far better than even the most wellinformed journalistic accounts those two shootings were a thousand times repeated though the reports were rare in admitting that the victims were civilians more usually the dead were automatically identified as ‘terrorists caught in the act regardless of evidence to the contrary the most famous of the wikileaks discoveries concerned an event in baghdad on twelve july two thousand and seven during which the us military claimed to have killed a dozen terrorists but the incident had been filmed by the gun camera of the us apache helicopter that had carried out the shootings and the people it targeted were all civilians much was known about the killings because among the dead were two local journalists working for reuters it was known too that such a video existed but the pentagon refused to release it despite a freedom of information act request appalled by what the video revealed about the way the us was conducting its war on terror and appalled by the contents of the thousands of reports and cables it was stored alongside a junior us intelligence analyst called bradley manning who later changed her legal gender and became chelsea manning released the entire archive to wikileaks the video still has the power to shock the two helicopter pilots exchange banter about the slaughter in the street below ‘ha ha i hit them one says ‘oh yeah look at those dead bastards the other says they have mistaken the camera held by one of the journalists for a rocketpropelled grenade launcher unlikely though it was that armed insurgents would stand in the open in baghdad with a us helicopter hovering overhead they shoot again at the wounded as one of them probably the reuters assistant saeed chmagh crawls towards a van that has stopped to rescue them when the pilots are told over the radio that they have killed a number of iraqi civilians and wounded two children one of them says ‘well its their fault for bringing their kids into the battle the wikileaks documents exposed the way the us as the worlds sole superpower really conducted its wars – something that the military and political establishments saw as a blow to their credibility and legitimacy there were some devastating revelations the helicopter video among them but many of the secrets uncovered werent particularly significant or indeed very secret in themselves they dont explain the degree of rage wikileaks provoked in the us government and its allies this was a response to assanges assault on their monopoly control of sensitive state information which they saw as an essential prop to their authority making such information public as assange and wikileaks had done weaponised freedom of expression if disclosures of this kind went unpunished and became the norm it would radically shift the balance of power between government and society – and especially the media – in favour of the latter it is the us governments determination to defend its ongoing monopoly rather than the supposed damage done by the release of the secrets themselves that has motivated it to pursue assange and to seek to discredit both him and wikileaks this campaign has been unrelenting and has had a fair measure of success despite the fact that most of the charges made against assange are demonstrably untrue regarding the release of documents there were two lines of attack first assange and wikileaks were accused of revealing information that endangered or led to the deaths of americans or their allies in iraq and afghanistan second they were accused of having injured the us state in general through activities amounting to espionage which should be punished as such much more damaging to assange however and to the whole wikileaks project were the allegations of rape made against him in sweden also in 2010 this led to a prosecutorial investigation lasting nearly ten years which was dropped three times and three times restarted before finally being abandoned last november as the statute of limitations approached beyond which no charges could be brought the result is that assange has become a pariah lost is the fact that he and wikileaks did what all journalists should do which is to make important information available to the public enabling people to make evidencebased judgments about the world around them and in particular about the actions of their governments given the constant drum beat of attacks on assange from so many directions it can be hard to remember that in two thousand and ten wikileaks won a great victory for freedom of expression and against state secrecy and that the us government and its allies have made every effort to reverse it the early attempts to discredit assange focused on trying to prove that the wikileaks disclosures had led directly to the deaths of us agents and informants the pentagon put a great deal of effort into substantiating this allegation it set up an information review task force headed by a senior counterintelligence officer brigadier general robert carr which studied the impact of the revelations and sought to produce a list of people who might have been killed because of the information the cables contained carr later described the extent of his task forces failure in testimony given at mannings sentencing hearing in july 2013 after long research his team of one hundred and twenty counterintelligence officers hadnt been able to find a single person among the thousands of american agents and secret sources in afghanistan and iraq who could be shown to have died because of the disclosures carr told the court that at one point his task force seemed to be getting somewhere the taliban claimed to have killed a us informant identified in the wikileaks cables it was a sign of desperation on the part of the counterintelligence officers that in seeking evidence against wikileaks they were reduced to citing the taliban as a source and as carr admitted during the defence crossexamination the taliban turned out to be lying ‘the name of the individual killed was not in the wikileaks disclosures despite all this the lawyer representing the us government at assanges extradition hearings in london earlier this year still argued that assange had put the lives of us sources in iraq and afghanistan at risk in kabul in 2010 just after my first look at the diplomatic cables wikileaks had released i happened to be meeting an american official for an off the record talk about the situation in afghanistan i asked him for his thoughts on the cables he replied by asking what classification code appeared at the top of the pages id seen when i told him he was dismissive about the degree to which the documents really contained deeply held secrets classified though they may be he explained that the us government wasnt so naive as to believe that information stored on a database to which as many as half a million people had access – one of whom turned out to be private manning – was likely to stay confidential for very long known as siprnet secret internet protocol router network the database had originally been the sole property of the pentagon but was used more widely in the aftermath of 911 when it became clear that parts of the us bureaucracy had valuable information that other parts didnt know about siprnet was

the sort of city government rahm emanuel champions has only been made possible because the nationstate now exists to shoulder much of the burden of warfare and finance it is one of the luxuries of the modern age mayors get to do buttigiegstyle bijou polit…|some​ books appear at exactly the wrong moment which only makes them more interesting rahm emanuel was mayor of chicago between two thousand and eleven and 2019 in short order he has turned out a boastful and boosterish account of his time in office which also serves as his manifesto for a new way of doing politics emanuel believes that the worlds hundred leading cities generate the economic intellectual and cultural energy of the planet as a result he says ‘mayors effectively run the world now emanuel quit a highflying career in washington to return to his hometown of chicago he had been an adviser to bill clinton then a leading congressman and finally obamas chief of staff some felt that he may have been headed for the white house in his own right but he has no regrets who would want to be president these days he thinks the federal government is where good ideas go to die cities like chicago are where its at it just takes mayors like him to make it happen the nation city was published at the end of february a few days before the us recorded its first covid19 fatality three months later chicago alone has seen around four thousand deaths and more than eighty thousand confirmed cases large parts of the city have shut down no one can blame emanuel for having failed to anticipate any of this still the disease has left him looking a little foolish his template for how to turn your city into a model of dynamic enterprise and liveable community is so very 2019 it comes with easy to follow instructions first focus on education particularly in the early years and make sure kids are in school as much as possible this is a good idea but hard to do at the moment second encourage tourism which is the great provider of new jobs third invest heavily in the airport fourth attract all the service industries you can especially restaurants fifth form partnerships wherever possible with universities and work to bring in more students finally if you get stuck ask mike bloomberg what to do next hell know you see the problem at least emanuel didnt go all in on the cruiseship business though if chicago were on the coast he might have done lets start with bloomberg its not emanuels fault that his mayoral mentors political lustre has been tarnished by a lamentable late bid to capture the democratic presidential nomination bloomberg achieved his primary goal which was to stop bernie sanders it cost him a lot – in money and personal humiliation – but at least his failure helped to focus minds on the alternatives suddenly joe biden didnt look so bad but it was the way he failed bloomberg came across as such a mayor – patrician managerial used to getting his own way impatient with the questions preferring policy pronouncements to raw politics he seemed to believe he was above it all a technocrat among the politicos of course emanuel would say that this proves his point mayors arent cut out to be president because they are problemsolvers not grandstanders but the kind of mayoral politics emanuel champions has a tendency to look a little aloof when it moves outside its comfort zone it wasnt so much that bloomberg was ill at ease on the national stage it was that he thought it didnt matter not all mayors are like that boris johnson who was mayor of london has made the move up from city to national government in part by doing nothing to conceal his appetite to dominate the bigger stage but johnsons growing discomfort as prime minister reflects his mayoral roots in london he was used to coasting whenever he could and delegating the hard stuff as pm he cant and we all pay the price bloomberg by contrast is much happier in his role as the man who brings mayors together since his tenure as mayor of new york ended in two thousand and thirteen he has hosted regular gatherings for the leaders of americas cities and he sees himself as a conduit for good policy and good practice emanuel talks of ‘the brotherhood and sisterhood that exists among mayors bloomberg is their paterfamilias what emanuel values in these mayoral gettogethers is the absence of speechmaking or a set agenda its simply a way for overworked executives to kick back share their problems and spark some creative thinking emanuels thesis is that these days the best political ideas move horizontally from city to city rather than vertically from local to national government or back again its a vision of politics that relies on a network of likeminded local leaders bypassing federal bureaucracy to get things done its attraction is that it is nonpartisan – the mayors come from both sides of the political divide – and pragmatic the downside is that it looks a lot like a private political club there was another mayor running for the democratic nomination this year pete buttigieg from south bend indiana he also features heavily in this book as an example of what makes mayors different buttigieg argues that mayors are far more connected with the lives of the people they represent than other politicians because they are much closer to the ground city leaders cant take time out from their jobs because the city never sleeps something always needs fixing unlike national politicians they have to live permanently in the places they run and they have to respond to their constituents concerns in real time ‘you cant offer alternative facts buttigieg says ‘if a road is in bad shape you cant point to it and say “this is the greatest road in the history of roads” people will call bs what you can do is ‘be nimble and try different ideas and see what works and what doesnt and in a matter of a few years you can literally see things actually working people getting jobs and neighbourhoods rising he calls it ‘the hardest and most rewarding job in the world it makes you wonder why buttigieg wanted to be president still theres no question that in his case sounding like a mayor was a big part of his national appeal more pragmatism less bs its the same argument rory stewart gave for quitting national politics in order to run for mayor of london before the pandemic put a stop to that being mayor was the only way you could be sure you were making a difference to peoples lives emanuel sums it up city government is ‘immediate intimate and impactful what creates the impact is not simply the proximity of the politicians to the people they govern its the proximity of those people to each other the density of city populations is what creates their energy as well as the need to find solutions in double quick time before the system gets overwhelmed as emanuel points out this has been the great shift in how we understand city life in recent decades from the 1960s to the 1980s urban density was thought to be what pushed residents away it was associated with crime inefficiency and crumbling infrastructure people moved out to the suburbs and beyond looking for space and security but then two things happened first crime rates started to fall dramatically in many big cities for reasons that are still much debated emanuel attributes it in large part to innovative local policy initiatives second the tech revolution which was supposed to accelerate the move out of the cities ended up having the opposite effect in the 1990s it was assumed that digital communication would strengthen the impulse to get away why live in the blighted city when you could work from home but not only did people not much want to work from home the tech revolution drove a desire for more human connection in the age of the internet it turned out we wanted to rub up against each other as much as possible in order to share ideas services and experiences the tech companies were no different they didnt want to be outside the city looking in they wanted to be at the heart of it where the tech companies led the rest followed a service economy puts a premium on physical proximity restaurants near businesses businesses near universities universities near parks parks near schools schools near homes homes near restaurants if you can walk between them all so much the better and if you cant build cycle lanes so begins the virtuous circle of bringing people together in order to produce new ways of cohabiting which then allow more and more people to join its not clear what comes first the crowds or the solutions ‘did cities realise population increases because they became more liveable emanuel asks ‘or did they become more liveable because population increase demanded it in the end it doesnt much matter what matters is what works emanuels blueprint for 21stcentury city governance rests almost entirely on the assumption that this model is both progressive and sustainable bustling city life forces politicians to breach their ideological red lines it forces citizens to drop their prejudices against each other it forces businesses to notice the environment in which they are operating above all it keeps supplying new ways of doing things so nothing gets old in cities good ideas will drive out the bad in national governments bad ideas can drive out the good thats emanuels pitch bet on the city because necessity is the mother of invention what​ he doesnt say is that this is sustainable only if you assume that nothing will disrupt the benign relationship between population growth and innovation but as weve learned in recent months any model of politics that relies on increased human density is intensely vulnerable to natural disruption bringing people together in ever larger numbers means that if something goes wrong everyone suffers emanuel takes for granted that if we keep up the population pressure human ingenuity will always stay one step ahead of natural risk ever since malthus warned that population growth was bound to outpace food production this has been|2020-06-05|0.9891|positive|0.10064550895475752|positive
retracted studies had relied on healthrecord analyses from a company that declined to share its raw data for an audit|two weeks after a highprofile paper in the lancet1 reported that the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine might be dangerous to patients with covid19 three of its four authors have retracted the work because they were unable to independently verify their data set a large proprietary collection of electronic health records analysed by surgisphere a us company on the same day four june the researchers and other coauthors retracted a paper in the new england journal of medicine nejm2 for the same reason that study published a month ago had looked at the impact of certain heart medications on people with covid19 and found no safety concerns scientists say the affair raises serious questions about the way researchers and journals evaluate the data underlying papers that they publish and may complicate the effort to trial drugs during the coronavirus pandemic “this whole event is catastrophic — it is problematic for the journals involved it is problematic for the integrity of science it is problematic for medicine and it is problematic for the notion of clinical trials and evidence generation” says ian kerridge a bioethicist at the university of sydney australia both papers relied on proprietary data analysed from electronic health records that were apparently gathered from hundreds of hospitals around the world by surgisphere but after critics raised questions about the studies the firm did not make its raw data available to thirdparty auditors for validation according to the retraction notice in the lancet surgisphere was concerned that transferring the data would violate client agreements and confidentiality requirements “since we do not have the ability to verify the primary data or primary data source i no longer have confidence in the origination and veracity of the data nor the findings they have led to” said mandeep mehra a cardiologist at brigham and womens hospital in boston massachusetts who was the lead author on both studies sapan desai the founder of surgisphere in chicago illinois and a coauthor of the studies declined to comment to nature on the retractions and on concerns about the quality of the data behind the studies desai signed the nejm retraction but not the lancet one after the lancet study appeared some regulators had paused enrolment in clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for covid19 the drug which is cheap and easy to administer has been widely endorsed in the pandemic including by us president donald trump despite scant evidence of its effectiveness some of the halted trials including one led by the world health organization are now starting again but researchers say theyve lost time and that enthusiasm to take part in the trials may be waning a third study authored by desai mehra and others that used surgisphere data which claimed to find a large reduction in covid19 mortality when patients were given the antiparasitic drug ivermectin has disappeared from the socialsciences preprint server ssrn where it was first posted on six april a second version was posted on nineteen april mehra told nature that he removed the study because he did not feel it was ready for peer review although the paper was not published in a peerreviewed journal it has nonetheless contributed to a surge in the popularity of ivermectin in south america says carlos chaccour of the barcelona institute for global health in spain who is running a clinical trial of ivermectin and had raised questions about the preprints data bioethicists say the retractions and the pulled preprint raise questions not only about the quality and nature of surgispheres data but also about why the papers other authors agreed to work with a large data set they couldnt validate and how the work passed peer review at prestigious medical journals the hydroxychloroquine study published on twentytwo may had purportedly analysed electronic health records gathered on 96000 patients in six hundred and seventyone hospitals across six continents but critics soon raised questions about oddities in the data and asked for more details on its origins by twentyeight may one hundred and twenty researchers had signed a letter to the lancet highlighting their concerns the questions also cast doubt on the nejm study which relied on surgisphere data that apparently covered almost 9000 patients across one hundred and sixtynine hospitals mehra says he and other coauthors asked for an independent audit of the data in both papers from medical technology  practice patterns institute mtppi a healthcare data research institute in bethesda maryland but on three june mehra says mtppi told them that surgisphere would not share the data “because of agreements with its clients and the fact that the documents contain confidential information” mehra and his coauthors asked for retractions before they published the studies researchers and journals should have asked more questions about how so comprehensive a data set had been gathered from hospitals across the world in the middle of a pandemic says wendy rogers a bioethicist at macquarie university in sydney “it is always easier with hindsight” she says “but in general with the covid19 research there has been such a rush that all sorts of really abysmal papers are getting published” researchers testing hydroxychloroquine in large clinical trials say theyre worried that the publicity around the lancet findings may make it harder to complete their research even though the paper has now been retracted “were hearing that people just arent interested in hydroxychloroquine” says david smith an infectious disease specialist at the university of california san diego who is helping to run a trial funded by the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases to test the drug in people with covid19 who have not been hospitalized “the retraction wont get anywhere near as much news as the original study” he says “we may never get an answer about treatment with hydroxychloroquine” most data on hydroxychloroquine in covid19 has come from in vitro studies or small clinical trials on five june however researchers with a large randomized uk trial called recovery announced that their data on more than 4600 hospitalized patients indicated that hydroxychloroquine didnt reduce the risk of death and they were stopping that arm of the trial and a randomized controlled study in eight hundred and twenty people reported on three june that the drug was not effective in preventing infection among people who were at high risk of infection following exposure to someone with covid193 in contrast to the retracted lancet paper the studies found no evidence of toxicity to the heart from hydroxychloroquine treatment those findings dont rule out possible benefits from hydroxychloroquine in other settings says joseph cheriyan a clinical pharmacologist at the cambridge university hospitals nhs foundation trust in the united kingdom where trials testing the drug were halted pending a safety review after the lancet paper one has since resumed “the only way were going to know is if we do the trials and what is frustrating is that this article has essentially delayed us” he says it is not uncommon for studies that use large data sets to be published without external scrutiny of the raw data says smith but an exception to this is when the paper is expected to have particularly high impact as in the lancet case in this instance he says it appears that extracareful review was skipped “its a rush right now” he says “we are desperate for knowledge and maybe were skipping over some of our triedandtrue checks” both the lancet and the nejm said their peer review processes were confidential and that they could not give details about how quickly the papers were reviewed “the article had external peer review and statistical review as well as scientific and manuscript editing however as we would do with any incident of this type we are reviewing our procedures including how we assess research analyzing large datasets based on electronic medical record data said an nejm spokesperson surgispheres ivermectin preprint may have a longer life the peruvian government included the drug in its national treatment guidelines a few days after a white paper cited the ssrn preprint chaccour says and a week after that bolivia added ivermectin to its treatment guidelines citing the situation in peru paraguay has issued restrictions on the sale of ivermectin because of high demand after chaccour gave a talk about ivermectin to the peruvian academy of sciences streamed on facebook he says he gets texts almost every day from people saying that they have an infected family member and can obtain formulations of ivermectin intended for use in animals not people “they send me a photo of a veterinary formulation and ask me ‘would you mind telling me what dose we should use” he says “it is broadly available and people are broadly desperate and this could lead to misuse”

think about danielles upcoming postpartum post i speak with shana about said ig post i check the news again to see if the situation in americas cities has gotten worse overnight i do not want to face the day i do not want to face my guilt or my sadness it is all too heavy i try to think about how well get outside today weve committed to going outside five days out of seven during quarantine — without putting ourselves in potential danger of a protest that could potentially get out of hand you can imagine how selfish this feels i move to the living room for my morning yoga i watch the line of the cars on the highway i know in my gut these cars are coming to center city to attend the protest i am going to skip i begin to think about my response i watch as the citys police force in their cars with their bicycles attached head into center city to get into place for the protest i have decided we are not attending i had struggled through a day of “wrong responses” on friday first mr trumps inflammatory response to the nations protests the looting and shooting one “wrong response” i thought then i listened appalled as columnist david brooks gave another “wrong response” when brian lehrer asked him to put the presidents tweet into the context of his previous days column “if we had a real leader” instead of condemning the presidents call for violence against protestors and looters brooks buried the idea in a lament about us living under the barrage of mr trumps twittocracy over the past three years he said maybe its a complicated response because he doesnt condone rioting he — clearly — could not bring himself to condemn the presidents call for violence this seemingly insignificant moment overshadowed — and dare i say ignited — my mood of overwhelming sadness for an entire weekend this glaringly incorrect response to a peoples suffering and its leaders failure during our team catchup friday when prompted by syd shana said she would write her weekend post about “something light” she said she has just written about ahmaud arberys death and that nothing changes disappointing response i thought i had an afternoon checkin with a i was sad i needed to regroup we regrouped we spoke of woke sadness maybe wed do a facebook live for tme on woke sadness s checked in shed written a post she had sat down and gotten angry and written i love when s does that as i do yoga my mind is cinematic i had scrolled through the ap and ny times apps the night before as i have done nightly since weve been in quarantine and looked at all the pictures of chaos coming out of americas cities i do not have a tv for this reason my mind is visual enough living in a pandemic has given any obsessive or compulsive anxieties new life my amygdala is already working overtime i watch my mind as i do yoga it explores my own response — or lack thereof is it the images — the ones my mind is stuck on — of people — officers and protestors their faces within inches of each other — yelling my mind translating this as a transmission of covid19 — that is keeping me from protesting today i mean…anyone who has been hospitalized as a covid19 patient and had no test or inconclusive test results has no interest in being hospitalized for covid19 and therefore quite frankly no interest in being near other people the nonchalance of derek chauvin smug and calm spread around social media…i dont need to watch the video i finally learned that in 2016 after years of traumatizing myself by doing so every summer michael brown freddie gray philando castille of course it took someone else to point out that people of color viewing so much violence against other people of color can be traumatizing it is perhaps it is because i am no longer an expat i attended plenty of protests in two thousand and sixteen and two thousand and seventeen with goose in tow — from standing rock to the womens march and the healthcare march — and even in 2018 even though i returned to the us in 2014 i still considered myself an expat for a number of years as an expat i had power i had power because for the six years i lived overseas i got to be an american just an american nationality ethnicity religion…yes i had to answer some of those questions and check those boxes—but for both nationality and ethnicity i could simply write usa or north american i didnt have to go through the mental minefield and jungle of arguments to determine whether to choose “black” “africanamerican” native american” “white” “multiracial” “other” … “should i choose one or check all that mathematically apply americas history is complex being africanamerican is complex” “is there a benefit to one over the other on this particular form” “will it work against me to declare my “race” “why are they asking for a race race is a social construct and we should stop giving it power” so by the time i returned to the us i felt human i felt strong and independent and socioeconomically invincible…even if i was broke ive done this before ive grabbed my bike strapped my 4 then 5yearold daughter in for protests so she could learn social justice the way other young warriors have i was not worried back then – obama too had made me american with his notion of a shared narrative philly for twenty years has successfully and peacefully protested and i have experienced that granted i learned to get there on time and leave when it was officially over usually because it was a weeknight and we had to have dinner and get ready for bed but i showed up i showed up — and with goose of course my fears — because thats what they are anxiety running amok in the midst of americas crisis of violence in the midst of a global pandemic — are not about the protest and my reasons for staying home are not about not wanting to protest my fears are of a police system on steroids the militarization of american police departments — if you remember that exploration in two thousand and fourteen after the riots in ferguson — is one of the greatest fears i live with it has only become amplified since i have given birth and reluctantly returned with my daughter to a country that has taken the bodies of trayvon martin tamir rice sandra bland michael brown alton sterling eric garner freddie gray philando castile atatiana jefferson breonna taylor george floyd and many more i have no fear of a protest or protestors or even of rioters or looters i have no fear of my fellow citizens except maybe some of the guntoting ones i can get myself in and out of a dangerous situation — all the more easier when my daughter was in the seat on my bicycle than if like now shed have to be on her own us unconnected it is an inappropriate police response that paralyzes me imprisons me in my own home — and in my head a k and i check in over text k expresses her desire to head to the protest i express my guilt over my lack of will i feel ashamed of my response — or lack of response unfortunately the stream of police cars with the bicycles attached that i associate with peaceful protests morph throughout the day into a traumatizing montage of invisible — but not silent — unrest — in a very disturbing way i try to go about my day — monday is looming and the housework and home admin must get done but what does monday even mean right now what does work even look like on monday i sit at my desk to start the grocery order i move to the kitchen to cook i start moving plants to the balcony that have been waiting to be planted for months i lay out a “magic screen” to hang on the balcony door i tell goose to get ready because we are going outside soon i do all of this over and over and over again in circles unable to quiet the monologue in my head midafternoon i see there is no traffic on the highway — 676 aka the vine expressway — which runs through the city this is not a good sign the expressway is eyelevel with our apartment we look the police have blocked the highway and then it begins the activity that will continue throughout the weekend — that continues until now caravans of police — police vans paddy wagons state trooper suvs — with their sirens back and forth across the expressway helicopters above us the police car that is blocking the offramp angled just so so that it is facing us it is clear we are not going to go outside today that i am not going to prove to myself that i am not afraid i anxiously check my phone for news updates last time i had looked the scheduled protests of the day had been peaceful the first even socially distant it is time to pot the plants we go to the balcony in front of the police with helicopters whirring above us my stomach churning goose starts planting the herb garden my mother sent her for easter i am propagating plants how can i sit here potting plants i am a coward i am planting new life new life in honor of george floyd i feel calm for thirty seconds…or the length of that thought i am — if that officer is white if that officer is prejudiced — defying a stereotype i am planting plants with my daughter on a “nice” saturday afternoon it is a good thing we did not go on the roof of the parking lot to jump rope are those police helicopters or news choppers what if we had gone to the roof and they mistook our jumping rope for aggressive behavior or got confused and thought we had weapons you are being a good parent for staying home you could have gone to the city hall protest and things would have been fine and you would be continuing to model for your daughter social justice like you used to you would be doing what

community as they apply to early career investigators ecis we propose a series of collaborative initiatives aimed to sustain ecis and preserve and accelerate the ability to innovate with longlasting impact the current covid19 pandemic has had a pervasive effect including an unprecedented toll on health the economy and education worldwide the impact of this crisis on medical care delivery disrupting the healthcare economy in unprecedented ways and causing a nearcomplete halt to basic and translational biomedical research is substantive while the damage is widespread early career investigators ecis are at highest risk to experience a negative impact however this crisis also reveals opportunities to innovate in creating solutions that accelerate research programmes in the short and long term from our perspective the pause in laboratory and clinical research in the us owing to covid19 has lasted more than two months and is only resuming under careful orchestrated guidelines with an uncertain future this disruption to research presents itself in varied ways in regions across the world across the cancer science space this interruption has been creating uncertainty and suspended states of animation that are particularly detrimental to young investigators ecis including phd students postdoctoral researchers clinical fellows and junior group leaders are in a time of steep acceleration with respect to training milestones protected time fellowship funding and promotion reduced productivity during this time can produce an undesirable ‘flattening of the curve that is potentially unrecoverable it is heartening to see ecis prioritizing data analyses grant andor manuscript preparation and reviewing journals during their time out of the lab as an effort to maintain momentum as they balance their career responsibilities with a daunting set of demands related to increased personal responsibilities during the pandemic1 family care andor sustaining community ties may also be disproportionately carried by ecis particularly impacting women and the set of challenges faced by investigators who are from minority groups may be amplified moreover clinical trainees with indemand skillsets are necessarily being pulled from protected research time to provide clinical care to patients with covid19 these challenges further threaten the careers and trajectories of the next generation of cancer investigators it is also worrisome that job opportunities for ecis are rapidly diminishing during the pandemic academic institutions are facing unprecedented financial challenges with reduction in clinical revenue and philanthropic support efforts to counteract these challenges for example hiring freezes slowdowns in hiring andor salary reductions may persist for years moreover the international nature of the covid19 pandemic is adding barriers for those who require a visa andor international travel to continue their careers the resulting ‘backup will cause ecis to stay longer in current positions than intended or end up in limbo between assignments ecis may prematurely depart to pursue opportunities in industry or other arenas the current landscape has the potential to result in irreparable harm to a generation of talented scientists and derail the impressive progress we have seen in cancer research in the past decade the funding landscape for cancer research in the us context which is likely applicable to other contexts also presents daunting challenges universities and academic research andor clinical institutions will be operating with reduced resources to provide essential institutional support for hiring internal grants and new programmatic initiatives in the context of reduced clinical and endowment revenues moreover nonprofit organizations that provide foundation grants for research which ecis often depend on are seeing a precipitous reduction in donations this has resulted in reductions in ongoing grant support and a decline in funding opportunities which may continue for an extended duration therefore we foresee a major gap in support for salary protected time and pivotal investigations needed for the next generation to develop robust and durable research programmes lastly we regret the unique impact of social distancing that this pandemic is having on mentoring and networking opportunities for ecis scientific meetings are often the venue for ecis to present work meet and network with current and future leaders in their field and learn about cutting edge science from across the world this impact is particularly felt by ecis at institutions without robust scientific networks or career development programmes such that it can disproportionately impact those with less institutional support and a less vibrant local research environment what can we do in light of these headwinds we see this as an existential moment to galvanize the international cancer research community to collective action we believe every person can contribute and propose that collective efforts focus on these six core areas|2020-06-05|0.8997|positive|0.07666177908113393|positive
the question remains how many jobs have gone for good|dire headlines had already been prepared before the release of americas may jobs report on june 5th most analysts expected payroll employment to have fallen last month by several million on the heels of record declines in march and april and the unemployment rate to have jumped to nearly 20 instead the bureau of labour statistics reported a sharp increase in employment of 25m and a drop in the jobless rate from 147 a postdepression record to 133 although the american labour market remains deeply troubled president donald trump nonetheless convened a hastily called press conference to hail the news and declare the country back on the road to better days “this is better than a vshaped recovery” he said “this is a rocket ship” those bleak expectations had been set by a flow of dreadful economic news americans continue to file new claims for unemployment benefits by the million indices of economic activity showed that production kept declining across the economy in may although at a far slower pace than in april yet some highfrequency indicators—such as restaurant bookings and measures of personal travel—had indicated signs of revival and investors have been bullish for weeks pushing stock indices close to new highs they greeted the jobs data by sending the sp five hundred up by 26 but the details of the report though encouraging do not suggest that a rapid return to normality is imminent new hiring was concentrated in service industries primarily in health leisure and hospitality but the number of new jobs in may amounted to just a fraction of the total lost since february the leisure industry added about 12m last month but shed more than 8m in march and april part of the rebound in hiring can probably be explained by the structure of a federal aid programme intended to support small and medium businesses which provides emergency loans that will ultimately be forgiven if layoffs are avoided some of it too can be explained by initial steps towards reopening as firms that were temporarily shut restarted work at dramatically reduced capacity but although the number of americans on temporary furlough declined permanent layoffs rose by nearly 300000 taking the total to 23m disconcertingly given the protests against police violence wracking the country the jobless rate for black americans ticked upwards to 168 while that for whites fell labourmarket data are very likely to keep improving over the summer as state and local governments continue to ease lockdowns the critical question for the american economy however is how many job losses and firm closures will prove permanent joblessness will probably remain well above normal levels and policy support for the unemployed will continue to be justified there are signs however that this surprising gust of good news may be undercutting interest in more spending in washington meanwhile the risk of new economic disruption by covid19 or by civil unrest remains the jobs figures were indeed a pleasant surprise but it will be months or years until american workers can exhale without fear|2020-06-05|0.9456|positive|0.102572601010101|positive
concerns persist that covid19 vaccines could cause antibodydependent enhancement which can potentiate viral entry into host cells and worsen disease|in late may cansino biologics published the first data for its covid19 vaccine expressing spike protein the vaccine generated neutralizing antibodies in many recipients and appeared safe but the company like others in this space remains on alert for a dangerous phenomenon known as antibodydependent enhancement ade “its important to talk about it ade” says gregory glenn president of rd at novavax which launched its covid19 vaccine trial in may but “we cant be overly cautious people are dying so we need to be aggressive here” there are mounting theoretical concerns that vaccines generating antibodies against sarscov2 may bind to the virus without neutralizing it should this happen the nonneutralizing antibodies could enhance viral entry into cells and viral replication and end up worsening infection instead of offering protection through the poorly understood phenomenon of ade ade “is a genuine concern” says virologist kevin gilligan a senior consultant with biologics consulting who advises thorough safety studies “because if the gun is jumped and a vaccine is widely distributed that is disease enhancing that would be worse than actually not doing any vaccination at all” the degree of ade vaccine risk for sarscov2 is unknown “most experts who look at it acknowledge the potential risk but dont see compelling evidence for it in humans right now” says james crowe director of the vanderbilt vaccine center some view coronavirus ade as a laboratory phenomenon at least so far “the theoretical possibility of ade is there” says rafi ahmed director of the emory vaccine center “the more difficult question becomes how do you balance this concern with moving forward theres not an easy answer” ade was first described in one thousand nine hundred and seventyseven by virologist scott halstead then at the university of hawaii halstead studied dengue caused by four related but antigenically distinct viruses known as ‘serotypes halstead noted that animals previously infected with one serotype did worse if infected again with a different serotype than if never previously infected at all he found antibodies to be responsible for this phenomenon instead of neutralizing the virus the antibodies facilitated viral entry into host cells in vitro in his publication halstead presciently wrote “nonneutralising antibody presumably provides a specific molecular ‘ride for an infectious dengue virion into the interior of a receptive phagocytic cell” halsteads speculation was later proven correct not just for dengue a flavivirus but for other viruses including coronaviruses in cell culture experiments the coronavirus uses its spike protein to bind host receptors and infect airway cells but it also can infect immune cells typically macrophages antispike antibodies ideally bind and neutralize the virus either by blocking spike binding to its receptor or by preventing fusion of the virus with the cell but if antibodies fail to do this because they bind unproductively to the virus these nonneutralizing antibodies may instead using the fc region at the base of the antibody latch onto host macrophage fc receptors and ferry the virus into these host cells at least in vitro once inside the viruses replicate and then exit to further spread infection to neighboring cells and tissues poorquality antibodies that bind the virus without neutralizing it are one reason vaccine candidates fail and in theory could also cause ade delivering virions to host cells can sarscov2 infect macrophages “i dont know” answers stan perlman a coronavirus expert at the university of iowa “those data are not out there yet” the virus can infect macrophages in vitro but that doesnt necessarily translate to in vivo human biology “in tissue culture cells you can make almost any virus show this by jigging the right cells the right amount of antibody and the right virus but that is not really meaningful because of the fact that its so artificial” the risk that a covid19 vaccine will cause ade and facilitate infection “is completely theoretical” says novavaxs glenn “its a lab an animal phenomenon thats been observed but in rsv its a real clinical event” in a 1960s vaccine trial 80 of infants and young children immunized against rsv respiratory syncytial virus an rna virus in the family paramyxoviridae ended up hospitalized and two children died only 5 of the children in the control group required hospitalization vaccinated children carried high titers of nonneutralizing antibodies implicating ade in the tragic outcome although a t two inflammatory t cell response also probably contributed since then some vaccine studies in animals as well as human trials where vaccinated people had worse outcomes suggest ade at work but definitive evidence is lacking “we cant say they were not due to ade but theres not evidence that they were” says ahmed “there are many other ways that an immune response can cause damage” for coronavirus vaccines the ade story is similarly inconclusive cats vaccinated with spike protein against feline coronavirus died much faster than unvaccinated cats and carried more antispike antibodies implicating ade but macaques vaccinated against sarscov1 did not show enhanced infection or disease in humans limited data for vaccines against earlier coronaviruses did not show ade two vaccines against the closely related sarscov1 appeared safe in early trials a dna vaccine against the mers coronavirus in macaques protected all eight monkeys from infection symptoms and that mers vaccine was welltolerated in a two thousand and sixteen phase one human trial mers vaccine codeveloper david weiner director of the vaccine  immunotherapy center at the wistar institute codeveloped a very similar covid19 vaccine that inovio pharmaceuticals took into human trials in early april “we dont see it ade with flu we dont see it with so many other vaccines that we have” says ahmed “we shouldnt dismiss it completely but then if you look at the broader world of vaccinology this has not been seen” but gilligan says some earlier sars and mers vaccine candidates didnt advance because of signs of ade ade is a concern for monoclonal antibodies mabs too at least in theory because mabs that fail to neutralize the virus also could facilitate viral entry into cells many companies are working on such mabs for either covid19 prevention or therapy astrazeneca for example is partnering with vanderbilt which has identified expressed and evaluated virusneutralizing antibodies from b cells recovered from convalescents astrazeneca will take the best ones forward into clinical trials ade is part of the mab discussion “theres not a lot of obvious epidemiologic evidence for it yet” says vanderbilts crowe nevertheless he says “we will address this” crowes group will test for ade by seeing whether its monoclonal antibodies can deliver viruses into macrophages compared with antibodies whose fc region has been inactivated an antibody lacking fc cant bind macrophage fc receptors and thus cant cause ade thats why some companies are advancing mabs with the fc region knocked out still “the animal models are so inadequate right now it would be very difficult to prove whether ade is common or uncommon” crowe says for mabs the risk is probably low “youre already characterizing it as a highly neutralizing antibody” says ahmed convalescent antibody passive immunization trials now underway could carry some ade risk ahmed says “but i would be less concerned with that than with the vaccine that might be inducing suboptimal response” vaccine companies are fully aware of ade “all the groups have been discussing this everyones on the same page everyone wants a safe covid19 vaccine” says weiner inovio went forward into the clinic after showing safety in primates and is reassured by the strong human safety record of its mers vaccine but vaccine trials are being approved “without the usual amount of preclinical safetytox data available for guidance” says gilligan given the urgency the us food and drug administration and european medicines agency may have little choice but to give the go ahead to enter the clinic novavax launched a phase 12 trial of its vaccine a stable prefusion sarscov2 spike protein trimer nanoparticle vaccine with a saponinbased adjuvant in late may the company is experienced with viral vaccines its nanoparticle flu vaccine recently met its phase three endpoints the sarscov2 virus “is not new territory” glenn says adding that novavax and other vaccine companies can assay for whether antibodies can block spike protein–receptor binding or neutralize the virus or both which should prevent infection and ade “one has to address it” glenn says but he points out that ade is only a theoretical covid19 vaccine risk “its hypothesized from animal studies” he says “i think the way forward is to take it seriously do some animal studies show you dont have enhancement monitor during the trial my view is we cant let this issue keep us from getting to a vaccine that will save millions of lives” but anne de groot ceo of epivax argues for a more nuanced approach epivax develops tcelldirected vaccines using computational tools to select viral t cell epitopes the company found sarscov2 sequences that would appear human to t cell receptors this could be a problem for any vaccine “the t cells either dont respond as strongly because they think that the coronavirus spike is human or that sequence can trigger a regulatory t cell response” says de groot such t cells can interfere with beneficial antibody production and “you dont get neutralizing antibodies you get the kind of antibodies that actually potentially enhance infection” in other words ade showing vaccine

a dangerous phenomenon known as antibodydependent enhancement ade “its important to talk about it ade” says gregory glenn president of rd at novavax which launched its covid19 vaccine trial in may but “we cant be overly cautious people are dying so we need to be aggressive here” there are mounting theoretical concerns that vaccines generating antibodies against sarscov2 may bind to the virus without neutralizing it should this happen the nonneutralizing antibodies could enhance viral entry into cells and viral replication and end up worsening infection instead of offering protection through the poorly understood phenomenon of ade ade “is a genuine concern” says virologist kevin gilligan a senior consultant with biologics consulting who advises thorough safety studies “because if the gun is jumped and a vaccine is widely distributed that is disease enhancing that would be worse than actually not doing any vaccination at all” the degree of ade vaccine risk for sarscov2 is unknown “most experts who look at it acknowledge the potential risk but dont see compelling evidence for it in humans right now” says james crowe director of the vanderbilt vaccine center some view coronavirus ade as a laboratory phenomenon at least so far “the theoretical possibility of ade is there” says rafi ahmed director of the emory vaccine center “the more difficult question becomes how do you balance this concern with moving forward theres not an easy answer” ade was first described in one thousand nine hundred and seventyseven by virologist scott halstead then at the university of hawaii halstead studied dengue caused by four related but antigenically distinct viruses known as ‘serotypes halstead noted that animals previously infected with one serotype did worse if infected again with a different serotype than if never previously infected at all he found antibodies to be responsible for this phenomenon instead of neutralizing the virus the antibodies facilitated viral entry into host cells in vitro in his publication halstead presciently wrote “nonneutralising antibody presumably provides a specific molecular ‘ride for an infectious dengue virion into the interior of a receptive phagocytic cell” halsteads speculation was later proven correct not just for dengue a flavivirus but for other viruses including coronaviruses in cell culture experiments the coronavirus uses its spike protein to bind host receptors and infect airway cells but it also can infect immune cells typically macrophages antispike antibodies ideally bind and neutralize the virus either by blocking spike binding to its receptor or by preventing fusion of the virus with the cell but if antibodies fail to do this because they bind unproductively to the virus these nonneutralizing antibodies may instead using the fc region at the base of the antibody latch onto host macrophage fc receptors and ferry the virus into these host cells at least in vitro once inside the viruses replicate and then exit to further spread infection to neighboring cells and tissues poorquality antibodies that bind the virus without neutralizing it are one reason vaccine candidates fail and in theory could also cause ade delivering virions to host cells can sarscov2 infect macrophages “i dont know” answers stan perlman a coronavirus expert at the university of iowa “those data are not out there yet” the virus can infect macrophages in vitro but that doesnt necessarily translate to in vivo human biology “in tissue culture cells you can make almost any virus show this by jigging the right cells the right amount of antibody and the right virus but that is not really meaningful because of the fact that its so artificial” the risk that a covid19 vaccine will cause ade and facilitate infection “is completely theoretical” says novavaxs glenn “its a lab an animal phenomenon thats been observed but in rsv its a real clinical event” in a 1960s vaccine trial 80 of infants and young children immunized against rsv respiratory syncytial virus an rna virus in the family paramyxoviridae ended up hospitalized and two children died only 5 of the children in the control group required hospitalization vaccinated children carried high titers of nonneutralizing antibodies implicating ade in the tragic outcome although a t two inflammatory t cell response also probably contributed since then some vaccine studies in animals as well as human trials where vaccinated people had worse outcomes suggest ade at work but definitive evidence is lacking “we cant say they were not due to ade but theres not evidence that they were” says ahmed “there are many other ways that an immune response can cause damage” for coronavirus vaccines the ade story is similarly inconclusive cats vaccinated with spike protein against feline coronavirus died much faster than unvaccinated cats and carried more antispike antibodies implicating ade but macaques vaccinated against sarscov1 did not show enhanced infection or disease in humans limited data for vaccines against earlier coronaviruses did not show ade two vaccines against the closely related sarscov1 appeared safe in early trials a dna vaccine against the mers coronavirus in macaques protected all eight monkeys from infection symptoms and that mers vaccine was welltolerated in a two thousand and sixteen phase one human trial mers vaccine codeveloper david weiner director of the vaccine  immunotherapy center at the wistar institute codeveloped a very similar covid19 vaccine that inovio pharmaceuticals took into human trials in early april “we dont see it ade with flu we dont see it with so many other vaccines that we have” says ahmed “we shouldnt dismiss it completely but then if you look at the broader world of vaccinology this has not been seen” but gilligan says some earlier sars and mers vaccine candidates didnt advance because of signs of ade ade is a concern for monoclonal antibodies mabs too at least in theory because mabs that fail to neutralize the virus also could facilitate viral entry into cells many companies are working on such mabs for either covid19 prevention or therapy astrazeneca for example is partnering with vanderbilt which has identified expressed and evaluated virusneutralizing antibodies from b cells recovered from convalescents astrazeneca will take the best ones forward into clinical trials ade is part of the mab discussion “theres not a lot of obvious epidemiologic evidence for it yet” says vanderbilts crowe nevertheless he says “we will address this” crowes group will test for ade by seeing whether its monoclonal antibodies can deliver viruses into macrophages compared with antibodies whose fc region has been inactivated an antibody lacking fc cant bind macrophage fc receptors and thus cant cause ade thats why some companies are advancing mabs with the fc region knocked out still “the animal models are so inadequate right now it would be very difficult to prove whether ade is common or uncommon” crowe says for mabs the risk is probably low “youre already characterizing it as a highly neutralizing antibody” says ahmed convalescent antibody passive immunization trials now underway could carry some ade risk ahmed says “but i would be less concerned with that than with the vaccine that might be inducing suboptimal response” vaccine companies are fully aware of ade “all the groups have been discussing this everyones on the same page everyone wants a safe covid19 vaccine” says weiner inovio went forward into the clinic after showing safety in primates and is reassured by the strong human safety record of its mers vaccine but vaccine trials are being approved “without the usual amount of preclinical safetytox data available for guidance” says gilligan given the urgency the us food and drug administration and european medicines agency may have little choice but to give the go ahead to enter the clinic novavax launched a phase 12 trial of its vaccine a stable prefusion sarscov2 spike protein trimer nanoparticle vaccine with a saponinbased adjuvant in late may the company is experienced with viral vaccines its nanoparticle flu vaccine recently met its phase three endpoints the sarscov2 virus “is not new territory” glenn says adding that novavax and other vaccine companies can assay for whether antibodies can block spike protein–receptor binding or neutralize the virus or both which should prevent infection and ade “one has to address it” glenn says but he points out that ade is only a theoretical covid19 vaccine risk “its hypothesized from animal studies” he says “i think the way forward is to take it seriously do some animal studies show you dont have enhancement monitor during the trial my view is we cant let this issue keep us from getting to a vaccine that will save millions of lives” but anne de groot ceo of epivax argues for a more nuanced approach epivax develops tcelldirected vaccines using computational tools to select viral t cell epitopes the company found sarscov2 sequences that would appear human to t cell receptors this could be a problem for any vaccine “the t cells either dont respond as strongly because they think that the coronavirus spike is human or that sequence can trigger a regulatory t cell response” says de groot such t cells can interfere with beneficial antibody production and “you dont get neutralizing antibodies you get the kind of antibodies that actually potentially enhance infection” in other words ade showing vaccine

as cities end coronavirus lockdowns publictransit authorities will need ways to increase ridership—safely early attempts in some european cities can offer lessons to those elsewhere in europe|this article was a collaborative global effort by david chinn carsten lotz luuk speksnijder and sebastian stern with raphaelle chapuis ruby holmes arthur knol karim tadjeddine and koen wolfs representing views from the public  social sector and travel logistics  infrastructure practices the past several weeks have seen european cities such as london munich and paris relax lockdown measures intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus with those adjustments has come a challenge enabling people to get around for many who live work and attend school in cities getting around means taking a bus or train—and often riding shoulder to shoulder with fellow passengers so how can all those people cross town using public transit while keeping a safe distance from one another the short answer is that they can only do so in much smaller numbers than before maintaining physical distancing will reduce the capacity of publictransport systems to between fifteen and thirtyfive percent of prepandemic levels metro systems built for high passenger density may see the steepest reductions transport for london the government body responsible for the publictransportation system in greater london estimates that with 20 meters approximately 65 feet of physical distancing the london underground or tube will be able to carry thirteen to fifteen percent of the passengers that it normally does even at full service mckinsey analysis of regional rail lines in the netherlands suggests that the capacity of those lines could be cut to twenty to twentyfive percent because of physicaldistancing rules requiring 15 meters approximately five feet of separation between people because of lockdowns these limitations have not presented much of a problem stayathome orders and workplace closures have lowered publictransit ridership to ten to fifteen percent of the usual level according to mckinsey analysis of multiple european countries but as lockdowns ease and businesses reopen more people will want or need to move about in the short term transit authorities must somehow enable ridership increases which will support an economic recovery and also maintain publichealth measures that will help stifle a recurrence of the virus in the medium term transit operators must restore riders confidence in public transport and they must figure out a way to deal with the financial losses that the decline in ridership—which is likely to persist for several years—will cause a topic we will revisit in a forthcoming article in this article we look at three methods that some cities are already using to solve the shortterm challenge of accommodating more transit passengers limiting riders to enable physical distancing staggering ridership throughout during the day and across the transit system and instituting rules and changes that safely increase system capacity these measures will also be instrumental in bolstering travelers confidence given that a mediumterm modal shift toward the use of private cars would increase congestion and make it more difficult to reach environmental targets under normal circumstances most publictransit trips are taken by office workers university students and people headed to or from recreational activities exhibit 1 encouraging these kinds of passengers to stay at home or to use other modes of transportation can free capacity for people who most need to take public transit such as those who hold jobs where they must be on site for example healthcare professionals first responders grocerystore staff and other essential workers or who have a housing situation that is not conducive to working from home or are lowerincome workers who cannot afford more expensive transportation alternatives such as taxis or private cars in the netherlands for instance twentyfive percent of people with low incomes rely on public transportation to get around while just eleven percent of people with high incomes do so mckinsey analysis of ridership in one european country illustrates this challenge during lockdown ridership dropped to about ten to fifteen percent of prepandemic levels the few riders who remained mostly worked in essential sectors that required workers to come to a workplace such as healthcare law enforcement and the food supply chain as sectors reopened and more people needed to move from place to place demand for public transport started to grow yet the percentage of train occupancy that allows passengers to practice strict physical distancing is just twenty to twentyfive percent that leaves little room for passengers other than the essential workers who must travel to their jobs to prevent crowding governments may want to consider continuing to advise against all nonessential trips they can also collaborate with employers on continuing to allow people to work from home people with office jobs account for more than twenty percent of passenger kilometers and they can work to minimize oncampus activities for students who account for another twenty percent of passenger kilometers government agencies might also collaborate on making it easier for people to walk and bicycle to their destinations instead of using public transport cities such as bogotá london mexico city paris and new york have all announced or taken action to expand cycling routes merely discouraging or restricting nonessential trips however wont always leave enough capacity for essential trips because those trips dont hold steady at ten to fifteen percent of capacity throughout the day to accommodate all essential trips further measures are necessary stagger ridership throughout the day and across the transit system demand for public transportation spikes during the morning and evening rush hours compared with midday the morning rush hour can see transit occupancy increase fivefold with the busiest lines running well above full capacity and standing passengers crammed into buses and train cars exhibit 2 shifting demand away from peak times will not only enable physical distancing but also make riding public transit more pleasant to do this some transit operators and city governments have implemented several changes largely aimed at allowing workers and students to alter their commuting schedules one change is staggering start times for schools public services and offices so that fewer people need to board public transit during rush hour periods some parts of israel for example are opening schools in shifts which reduces transportation congestion and crowds around schools similarly some schools and universities in the netherlands have spread start times over the day meanwhile in france only trips to and from work and school are allowed during peak periods in addition some transit operators have created extra waiting capacity at busy hubs its also possible to help riders make choices that alleviate crowding while some public rail operators have traditionally offered reservations on longdistance trains they have begun to do so for lightrail systems as well the danish rail operator dsb has added advancebooking capabilities which have helped keep trains from getting full taiwan has gone further instituting a strict reservations policy on suburban and intercity rail to limit occupancy and put safe physical distance between passengers other operators guide travelers toward spare capacity dsb has introduced an app showing which services and carriages have the most space for physical distance use of the app helped increase transit ridership by six percent during the first week of lockdown easing another approach to dispersing riders involves limiting service some cities such as paris have suspended access to certain stations or reopened lines at different rates other cities have limited stops at rushhour choke points including major intersections this compels riders to walk more or take alternative routes crowd controls and station closures can also prevent people from gathering too closely the key to limiting service effectively is constantly monitoring demand and watching for choke points so operators can quickly counteract crowding institute rules and changes that safely increase system capacity rules requiring passengers to observe health precautions are fundamental to safely increasing the capacity of public transit many countries in asia europe and north america either recommend or require face covers some operators have installed plastic screens on buses and trains to put barriers between riders as well as to separate transit workers from riders using protective equipment will increase safeoccupancy levels to up to forty percent of precovid19 levels exhibit 3 another rule which some chinese provinces have enacted requires passengers to undergo temperature screening before entering public transport—something that has not seen widespread adoption in europe because trains metros and trams travel on fixed lines and run at maximum occupancy during peak periods increasing capacity on critical lines could require opening parallel bus routes this technique which was already being used in certain countries to increase peak capacity could help transit systems carry more workers and students it could be a long time before physical distancing is no longer required and office workers can resume commuting every day students are invited back to university campuses and city dwellers can resume normal leisure activities until then cities and their publictransit systems will have to function in a state of partial openness careful management and safety measures can allow publictransit authorities to accommodate more passengers so they can avoid delaying economic recovery without contributing to a recurrence of the coronavirus but publictransport operators cannot do it alone they will need to work closely with local government officials on measures such as staggering

hotels and airlines will need protocols to ensure their clientele is potentially okay just as travellers will examine holiday escapes in minute detail|the late management guru peter drucker who presciently advocated “back room” outsourcing and corporate decentralisation at a time when these smart costsaving techniques were anathema to produceeverythinghireeveryone mega corporations had a few more tricks up his sleeve one of his key mantras – priceled costing – often overlooked even today yet something profoundly relevant to all businesses especially those connected with travel is worth reexamining in a dysfunctional covid19 world the central argument is simple most companies tend to create a product they feel the market wants and outspend each other to produce it subsequently passing on the entire cost to consumers with a further profit slab packed with humungous ceo salaries on top of all this extravagance this is costdriven pricing and is typical of the sort of big ego branding popular today drukers answer to this was blindingly simple check the price your audience might be willing to pay for a product and then keep production costs and profit margins within this budget this is priceled costing it is as relevant for airline seats as for luxury hotels of course priceled costing for any desirable good is entirely predicated on scarcity which drives price one of the problems monster brands like louis vuitton faced in asia was the sort of over exposure that instantly drove down perceived value often with perverse results at one point hongkongers shunned lvmonogrammed travel bags due to their mass popularity with macau casino bumpkins as airlines posit scenarios in a covid19 or postvirus world it seems an inescapable truth that passengers will need to be distanced and isolated somehow to allay fears of contagion with previous models entirely based on the sardine concept of spacing packing in seats and eliminating window exits to cram in more bodies this is jarringly revolutionary aircraft design will move towards more protected personal space with wraparound headrest partitions novel seating configurations and perhaps access to cargo areas reconverted into gyms or wellness escapes family cabins may arrive in economy modelled after the innovative qsuites on qatar airways that can turn into quads for foursomes fewer seats will invariably mean higher ticket prices will air passengers accept this additional burden on groaning wallets or might they consider it a worthwhile investment in emotional security or a sought after ‘luxury perk in other words might travel once again become something expensive rare and unattainable thereby bestowing upon it the original cachet of a romantic treat as in the days of the magnificent pan am clipper flying boats travellers will increasingly see luxury hotels as safe havens with trustworthy corporate protocols unlike the unregulated bottomfeeder airbnb offerings now fraught with unknown dangers private villa escapes will come to epitomise less is more a phrase hitherto spouted by many but believed by few huge cookiecutter fairylights hotels will not disappear as there is always space for midrange products but in a covid world there can be no scrimping on safety and this in turn will push prices up factoring in guest spacing staff training enhanced hygiene lavish wellness partnerships and thermalscanning equipment but regardless of whether price inches up or down business models must be thoroughly reviewed and reset dropping oil prices though this may be short term and the covid reality offer a huge opportunity for a travel rethink it is time to abandon the sloppy costled pricing that has dominated monster travel projects based on the assumption of everincreasing hordes of cashrich chinese consumers that is now a mirage as travel for the near term turns inward with a focus on domestic transactions and ‘safe corridors pairing cities or countries whether in china usa india thailand or indonesia priceled costing will be the key whether aiming for the luxury traveller or the less financially frivolous it is a sound argument for any time and a good one to take onboard as globalism goes through a major adjustment in the face of mounting ultranationalist sentiment – with some manufacturing and business travel returning home over time travellers willing to spend for a romantic break from the quotidian grind will make very careful choices and demand a lot more value they will be in the drivers seat now luxury travellers will not simply swarm marbled lobbies demanding free bellinis they will get tough travellers looking for value will be equally demanding gone are the days when a guesthouse could say ‘you get what you pay for safety cuts both ways hotels and airlines will need protocols to ensure their clientele is potentially okay just as travellers will examine holiday escapes in minute detail perhaps preferring less trampled outoftheway places like the maldives where privacy is ensured and social contact minimised business travellers cautiously venturing out may be the hardest hit as this is the segment where the travel sector will

loss carryback rules are fine in theory but arent as straightforward as they may seem|on april 30 the government fasttracked new legislation to introduce further tax changes in response to the impacts of the covid19 outbreak the key tax component of the covid19 response taxation and other regulatory urgent matters act two thousand and twenty is a temporary tax loss carryback measure broadly this allows businesses that anticipate being in a loss for the two thousand and twenty or two thousand and twentyone tax years to carry some or all of the loss back to the preceding year to enable an immediate cash refund of prior tax paid read more  top tips for small businesses looking at implementing an ecommerce solution  small business owners hungry for advice and information as they recover from covid19  answers to common questions about the covid19 wage subsidy scheme  your questions on handling provisional tax now that covid19 has hit your cashflow to be eligible a taxpayer must have made or anticipate they will make a loss in either of the two thousand and twenty or two thousand and twentyone tax years the taxpayer must have a profit in the year prior to the loss year this means  losses from the two thousand and twenty year may be carried back to the two thousand and nineteen year  losses from the two thousand and twentyone year may be carried back to the two thousand and twenty year taxpayers can claim a tax refund for provisional tax paid by reestimating two thousand and twenty provisional tax where the two thousand and twenty return is not yet filed or by amending their two thousand and nineteen tax return to factor in the loss carry back the rules will apply to companies trusts and individuals other than those deriving only paye income and those that operate through partnerships and lookthrough companies overall this is a very positive initiative and one the government should be commended for however because of its rushed implementation its not perfect not necessarily as straightforward as it seems and will not suit all businesses each business will have different circumstances and each will need to consider whether this mechanism is the right option for them inland revenues systems went live in early may with the changes so taxpayers can make elections to carryback losses via the i want to section of myir a few considerations and scenarios to reflect on are outlined below most business will be looking to use this mechanism in relation to a loss incurred in the two thousand and twentyone year and carry this back to the two thousand and twenty income year which may still be profitable given covid19 may have only affected the last quarter of this year a business that needs cash urgently will want to elect to carry back its anticipated loss as soon as possible however a business will need to be fairly confident of the level of loss and think carefully about how the rest of the year will play out this is because if a business overestimates its two thousand and twentyone loss which results in tax payable use of money interest uomi will apply from august 28 two thousand and nineteen for a march balance date taxpayer which is the first instalment date of two thousand and twenty provisional tax further it will not be possible to apply for relief from uomi imposed under the remission rules recently enacted to minimise potential exposure to uomi the business might want to take a conservative position initially given we are only into the third month of the new tax year and reestimate the loss later or as the year progresses however holding off may not provide the muchneeded cash now which could force some businesses to take some risks in this regard timing of electing filing the return and monitoring losses will be key it will be possible to reestimate the two thousand and twentyone loss to carry back at any time prior to the earlier of the date the two thousand and twenty return is filed or the due date for filing the rules require the immediately preceding year to have taxable income there will be some companies where the pattern of income and losses is such that the carryback mechanism wont be much or any benefit for example taxable income in the two thousand and nineteen year might have been high under normal trading conditions and so two thousand and twenty provisional tax paid to date is based on residual income tax for this year taxable income in the two thousand and twenty year particularly if it is a late balance date might have dropped but may have only dropped to a lower taxable income and so it not yet a loss even if there are large losses anticipated in 2021 these will only be able to be carried back to the extent of the lower taxable income in the immediately preceding year which may not release that much tax paid likewise a company with a small loss in two thousand and twenty and a larger loss in two thousand and twentyone will be constrained to only being able to use the smaller loss in two thousand and twenty to amend only the two thousand and nineteen tax return such that the company is unable to carry back the larger loss incurred in 2021 refunds might be limited or trapped for taxpayers that are companies any refunds will be limited to the credit balance in its company imputation credit account at the date of the most recently ended tax year ie march 31 2020 although some timing exceptions apply therefore if a company has been in the habit of paying most of its profits as dividends to shareholders and attaching imputation credits it may find access to cash refunds is limited the policy rationale for this rule is that the companys tax has been paid to shareholders already via imputation credits any trapped refunds may be applied to income or provisional tax liabilities if any will exist if the company has traditionally paid out its profits for the year as shareholder salaries the company wont have any taxable income to carry future losses back to the shareholders and not the company in this case have paid the provisional tax therefore an option might be for the shareholders to estimate two thousand and twenty provisional tax to nil and have the company elect to not pay any shareholder salaries for the two thousand and twenty tax year if losses are forecast for two thousand and twentyone if this is possible however this could then expose the company to an fbt liability if there are outstanding current accounts so care is required other options may be feasible in this scenario the important point to note is that companies will need to do some work and determine what the approach to paying shareholder salaries should be in light of these rules the new act contains an antiavoidance measure which could apply if shares in any company have been subject to an arrangement so that a loss company falls into the rules if the purpose of the arrangement is to defeat the intention of the rules it is possible any cute “tax planning” of this nature to deliberately take advantage of the rules would be scrutinised down the track we acknowledge the government has brought these rules in under urgency to provide assistance for businesses in need of cash flow it has endeavoured to strike a balance of giving the muchneeded assistance accommodating the need for part year and grouping rules while still maintaining some integrity measures unfortunately doing all these things inevitably leads to complex legislation the decision to use this mechanism will be heavily fact dependent on each businesss circumstances there are policy design features that mean the rules will not be that useful to some of the sme businesses targeted it is clear it will not be the panacea for every business and could in some cases expose a taxpayer to significant uomi or other taxes unless care is taken robyn walker is a tax partner and veronica harley is an associate director at

economic damage of lockdowns even uberprudent germany has engaged in an extraordinary spending spree first to support businesses during the closure period and then this week announcing big vat cuts a €300 family bonus for every child and another round of business supports irelands achilles heel in the past is that the government has spent when we had the money and then been forced to cut back in times of recession boom and bust cycles resulted this time around having entered the pandemic in reasonable economic shape and with the budget in surplus we have some leeway ireland is engaged in a big fiscal stimuluswith government spending in the first five months of the year up by more than twenty per cent  fortunately the state can still borrow money at negligible interest rates to fund the deficit that is opening up thanks in part to unprecedented intervention from the european central bank so can the next government float into office on a wave of borrowed cash which it can dispense not really a careful reading of the recent report from the budget watchdog the irish fiscal advisory council shows that each stage of the crisis will bring its own challenges – and that we simply cant budget on the basis of being able to borrow at current interest rates forever we are walking a shaky financial tightrope as we move through this the hard calls start on day one for the next government yes ministers will have the cheque book out – but the queue at the hatch will be long and not everyone will get paid you could argue about just how high the deficit could be this year – and the answer might well end up north of ten per cent of gross domestic product – but there is a limit as well as the contentious issue of the phasingout of wage and income supports there are calls from business for more cash a lineup of state bodies with big financial holes and so on there is a strong case to go the extra mile on the onceoff supports – and minister for finance paschal donohoe hinted on friday that more help to protect businesses and jobs would likely be needed but deciding what will be subsidised through the crisis and what wont will be hugely controversial and as well as onceoff costs the need to provide ongoing higher levels of spending – in health childcare education public transport and so on – provides a big budgetary challenge donohoe referred this week to the likely need to continue borrowing in the years ahead to fund higher spending levels the programme for government if agreed and the subsequent national recovery programme may give some context to this and to how the public finances might evolve right now we need it  the “a” word is being thrown around in relation to every proposed reduction of an emergency support programme and every refusal to throw additional cash at some other problem what we are facing is not austerity – which is when a government hikes taxes and cuts spending to reduce the budget deficit during a recession that is what happened in two thousand and nine and 2010 now government borrowing is soaring the issue is making decisions on where the money goes to and how much we can spend – all against a backdrop of huge uncertainty pretending there is some endless supply of cash and no constraint at all on borrowing into the future is just not credible choices will also await in what the ifac called phase two which is when the government goes to stimulate the economy via higher spending probably moving into two thousand and twentyone if the openingup goes okay the council pencilled in €10 billion as a possible stimulus though said it should be “temporary and targeted” again you can just imagine the queue of mendicants for this  the money will only go so far and only last so long – and continued restrictions in areas like tourism might leave some sectors unable to benefit  the councils central expectation is that the economy might return to its precovid position in a couple of years that would be a result with the economy growing there would then be a job in adjusting tax and spending over a period of years to get the public finances back on a sustainable path the council guesstimated that this might involve tax hikes and spending cuts of €6 billion to €14 billion probably starting in 2023 but it should be possible to avoid another bout of severe austerity new government programmes separate from the pandemic will have to be paid for too and any credible programme for government must face the tradeoffs not increasing the pension age for example will leave less to spend elsewhere green policies are vital but come with a price tag we are facing into unprecedented uncertainty – we really dont have any basis to decide how the next few months will go the ifac analysis shows just how delicate the outlook is and how a worse health outcome could cause real challenges economics is all about the allocation of scarce resources and politics over the next few years will be too and the uncertainties make this a lot more difficult the ecb made clear this week that its programme to support the market would last until at least june of next year – and longer if needed but it said too that it is a

individuals health and safety this column describes the latest epidemiological evidence and argues that the biggest influence on individuals risk of severe illness is age individuals in their sixties face a thirty times higher fatality risk from covid19 than individuals in their thirties being obese nonwhite a man and having an underlying health condition also matter – each roughly doubles the fatality risk but chronological age still remains the biggest risk – a fact that universities should keep in mind when planning their autumnal schedules many european universities plan to reopen as physical spaces in the autumn of 2020 how much danger will that create what is an individuals risk of severe illness and death how should university leaders take the health of their staff into account when planning for the next academic year the economic issues were discussed recently in a voxeu article by peter dolton in our judgement the most reliable source of information on the risk from covid19 is a two thousand and twenty “open safely” paper written by elizabeth williamson of the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine with a large number of colleagues it is a piece of technical epidemiological writing we make an attempt to convey that papers substance in a way that we hope might be helpful to those enrolled and working in universities and the senior management teams who head them the first point to make is that the biggest influence on a persons covid19 risk is age the risk from age is actually an extraordinarily accelerating one loglinear as an approximation there have been grumpy and inaccurate discussions of this issue of age and risk in uk newspapers where lobby groups attacked the idea that chronological age is what matters instead the risk associated with socalled health conditions with being a man obese nonwhite or with having diabetes has been emphasized by the media further our two papers recommending a release out of the lockdown of the young have led to many older people reaching out to us voicing their beliefs that because they feel fit they face little or no risk from covid19 unfortunately that belief is incorrect age is the crucial risk to bear in mind as shown by williamson et al 2020 see figure 1 figure one deaths from covid19 in england and wales since january two thousand and twenty note number of deaths registered in england and wales where covid19 was mentioned in the certificate – up to 15052020 examining anonymized health records of seventeen million uk citizens the authors assess who has died from covid19 while statistically adjusting for a large number of influences on peoples risk standard regression equations are then used to calculates hazard ratios the results are the following • people between 5060 face a fatality risk from covid19 that is approximately fourteen times higher than the risk faced by those around the middle of the age band of 1840 • for individuals between 6070 who are in good health the risk is thirty times higher • the fatality risk of men is double that of women • individuals with middleaged spread holding other things constant face an about 50 higher risk • the same holds for nonwhite individuals as they face an almost doubled risk • most standard kinds of health conditions also increase fatality risk roughly two to three times in general the risk of individuals diagnosed with cancer is higher than the risk of men in general but it is still lower than the risk of simply being old hence the most prominent risk indeed stems simply from age in essence this is due to young ‘animals stronger immuneresponse to most viruses also applying to covid19 some newspapers have confusingly run headlines proclaiming obesity as a major cause of covid19 deaths however while keeping ones bmi below twentyfive is certainly advisable and obese people undoubtedly face a higher risk of dying from covid19 the main reason why obese people are dying much more is because obese people tend to be older a second worrisome concern is the likelihood of misleading triumphalism in europe over the coming summer premature optimism had lulled people already during the socalled spanish flu in the years of 19181919 figure 2 taken from taubenberger and morens 2006 depicts the three waves of deaths from the spanish flu the first wave which at the time seemed very large peaked in early summer of 1918 when it died down policymakers took a more relaxed approach as they believed it to be over unfortunately a second wave appeared in autumn of one thousand nine hundred and eighteen and the number of deaths this time was five times higher a third wave followed in the spring of one thousand nine hundred and nineteen but most deaths occurred in late autumn and winter just after the pandemic was believed to be over figure two deaths in the uk from the spanish flu 19181919 university presidents should keep this in mind when planning universities autumnal schedules our hunch is that misleading optimism about having beaten covid19 may appear by the end of the summer and lead to calls to open up uk universities in a really fundamental way while it may be true that covid19 will really be over by then it is also worryingly possible that we are in for some form of a rerun of 1918 as early hotspots for covid19 were places like meat packing plants and skiing resorts which are both characterized by low temperatures it is possible that the coronavirus microbe may prefer cold environments studying the spanish flu virus he et al 2013 conclude that every extra ten degrees celsius reduced the spread of this virus by nearly 50 of course covid19 is a different virus which might behave differently and much is still to be learned about covid19 a third concern is that the virus might mutate however there is not much that can be done about that except to hope for the best what should university faculty know and do first faculty members might want to appreciate the fact that most students are young and hence face a rather miniscule risk  current estimates suggest that it may be about the same as the risk of dying in a uk road accident in a normal year second university staff older than fifty may need to consider their own relative risk and might prefer to avoid frontline contact with students until a vaccine is found third and more encouraging current evidence suggests that even without a vaccine the great majority of europes population will live through the pandemic without serious illness absolute risk for most people appears to be fairly low and there even remains a slight chance that the virus will disappear more quickly than standard epidemiological modelling has predicted still there is a long and menacing path ahead of us for the coming autumn and winter where it pays for each individual to know about their own relative risk for university presidents and their management teams it is essential to recognize that the covid19 virus is much more dangerous to older members of university staff this time age matters editors note a shorter version of this article will appear in june in the times higher magazine in

primarily against tuberculosis – might offer protection from covid19 has become an understandably popular hypothesis this column finds that hope misplaced the authors exploit a natural experiment overlaying the large difference in bcg vaccination rates with the large differences in covid19 infection rates between the former east and west germany they find that the differences are attributable not to bcg but to the wests copious commuter flow patterns and the fact that the epidemic arrived there first as covid19 has spread across the globe so has an intense search for treatments and vaccines with numerous trials running in multiple countries several researchers eg hegarty et al 2020 miller et al 2020 ozdemir et al 2020 and prominent news outlets have noticed that countries still administering an old vaccine against tuberculosis had fewer coronavirus cases and fewer deaths per capita in the outbreaks early stages but is that correlation evidence that the bacillus calmetteguérin bcg vaccine provides some defence against covid19 in this column we describe the findings of our recent work bluhm and pinkovskiy 2020 looking at the incidence of coronavirus cases along the former border between east and west germany using modern econometric techniques to investigate whether historical differences in vaccination policies account for the lower level of infection in the east tuberculosis has been largely eradicated from the developed world and many rich countries have stopped using the bcg vaccine spain which ended mandatory bcg vaccination in 1985 experienced more than five hundred and eighty coronavirus deaths per million of its population and is one of the hardesthit countries in per capita terms portugal spains neighbour continues to perform mandatory bcg vaccination to this day and has experienced only one hundred and thirtyfive coronavirus deaths per million all numbers as of twentynine may 2020 more generally studies have documented that countries with mandatory bcg vaccination tend to have substantially fewer coronavirus cases and fewer deaths per capita than countries without mandatory vaccination and that the intensity of the epidemic is lower for countries that began vaccinating earlier eg hegarty et al 2020 miller et al 2020 ozdemir et al 2020 such crosscountry correlations do not imply causation belloc et al 2020 and sceptics have rushed to suggest that the passive immunisation from the bcg vaccine would at best be shortlived faust et al 2020 the who now cautions that there is currently no evidence that the vaccine protects against the novel coronavirus who 2020 because they are often unable to perform randomised experiments economists have developed a suite of methods to exploit “natural experiments” that occur by chance as human action unfolds we use one of these tools—a geographic regression discontinuity analysis dell 2010—to determine whether coronavirus prevalence changes markedly at the cold warera border between east and west germany whose vaccination policies differed prior to their reunification in 1990 east germany had mandatory bcg vaccination until reunification while west germany stopped voluntary but de facto universal vaccination in 1975 our setting presents a puzzle of its own many observers in germany have noticed a much lower coronavirus prevalence in the former east than in the west but found few convincing explanations for the difference moreover low mortality in germany as a whole has been the subject of widespread speculation we provide formal evidence that there is indeed a sizable discontinuity in covid19 cases at the border flexibly controlling for everything continuous there other important variables—such as disposable income and average age—also jump at the border but do not explain the discontinuity in covid19 cases however the difference in coronavirus prevalence is uniform across age groups rather than being dependent on whether individuals were born before or after the cessation of near universal vaccination in each part of the country this fact cannot be explained by a broader immunity acquired via the bcg vaccine covid19 prevalence is much higher in former west than in east germany we start our analysis with a map of coronavirus cases by county as of twentysix april using data from the robert koch institute the former border between east and west germany is outlined in red the darker the shading of a county the more coronavirus cases it has per million inhabitants several counties with high concentrations stand out such as heinsberg bordering the netherlands and much of bavaria – both places where the epidemic was first recorded there is clearly a greater density of coronavirus cases around major cities berlin hamburg and stuttgart as in the us more importantly we immediately see that counties just to the west of the former border are a much darker shade of blue than counties just to the east notes illustration of the spatial distribution of covid19 cases in germany as of twentysix april 2020 the map shows the log 1  casesmillion people in each county using population data from 2018 to formalise the intuition of this map we use a regression discontinuity design in which we nonparametrically estimate coronavirus prevalence as a function of the distance to the border and compare estimates from the eastern and western sides we present a graphical representation of this exercise in the chart below where the dependent variable is the logarithm of coronavirus cases per million inhabitants—a gauge of the exponential spread of the virus the jump at the border is about 07 log points which implies that there are half as many cases per capita in a former east german county than in a west german county just across the border this halving of cases dominates the variation in coronavirus prevalence among counties in the east where it is uniformly low and is sizable relative to the average prevalence in the west faraway counties in bavaria or near the border with france have the highest cases but a smooth spread from there would imply a continuous decline and cannot explain the precipitous drop at the border figure two discontinuity in log 1  casesmillion at former border notes illustration of the discontinuity log 1  casesmillion people across the former border between west and east germany the figure shows nonparametric local polynomial estimates for bins of the dependent variable where each bin is twenty km wide 95 confidence intervals are shaded in grey bcg vaccination is not driving this discontinuity our key piece of evidence makes the bcg hypothesis appear very unlikely we exploit the fact that east germany had mandatory vaccination from one thousand nine hundred and fiftythree to 1990 while west germany recommended vaccinating everyone from one thousand nine hundred and sixtyone to 1975 if the vaccine protects against the virus then we would expect that discontinuities in

identical in size contradicting what we would expect to see if the bcg hypothesis were true moreover for early april we have more finegrained data on cases for individual ages allowing us to form age

readjusted completely since reunification in other words western counties along the former border may remain more disconnected from their eastern neighbours than they would if a national border had never divided them as the epidemic started in the west it may have had a harder time spreading eastward because relatively fewer people commute between east and west than commute across comparable distances within the west or within the east the eastward spread of the virus was then further interrupted by the nationwide lockdown instituted on twentytwo march we simulate a canonical sir model of

is needed a survey experiment in the us and uk finds …|valuating health vs wealth the effect of information and how this matters for covid19 policymaking the behavioural interventions to control the spread of covid19 present tradeoffs between health and wealth to be successful an understanding of how the public currently values lives over economic loss is needed a survey experiment in the us and uk finds that people highly prioritise saving lives but this valuation will change as economic losses mount individual differences in valuation also predict individual compliance with covid19 policies and information on covid19 deaths and income losses can affect valuations caution in relaxing the lockdown will help build public support and mitigate polarising effects and through increasing compliance improve its economic efficacy in the absence of medicinebased responses to covid19 policymakers have to rely on behavioural interventions to control the transmission of the virus yet at least in the short run these interventions create a tradeoff between saving lives and saving the economy – a ‘health–wealth tradeoff the lockdown restrictions on individual freedoms for example saved lives by preventing transmission but they came at the cost of lost output and income baldwin and weder di mauro 2020 relaxing a lockdown involves the same tradeoff but in reverse the economy recovers but at a cost of an increased threat of virus transmission there are similar potential mediumterm tradeoffs in the choice between strategies of herd immunity and socalled ‘hammer and dance pueyo 2020 faced with such health–wealth tradeoffs how should policymakers decide where to locate the balance this question has led policymakers to dust off riskvaluation manuals to see whether the proposed movement makes costbenefit good sense for instance the oecd 2012 suggests on the basis of evidence that a figure between 15–45 million should be used as the statistical value of life with a base value of 3 million the eu uses a slightly wider range and a higher base value of 36 million armed with such a figure consider the uk lockdown the imperial college modellers predicted that lockdown would save several hundred thousand lives ferguson et al 2020 whilst current estimates point to a lockdown loss of more than 10 of gdp bank of england 2020 10 of gdp is £221489 million thus even if only one rather than several hundred thousand lives had been saved the lockdown would have cost about £2 million per life saved and would have produced a net benefit using the oecds base figure valuation of a life at 3 million beyond 100000 lives saved the net benefit from lockdown quickly becomes enormous setting aside arguments against using costbenefit analysis in such decisions there are two problems with recycling oecd or other estimates of the value of a statistical life first the figures vary widely and – although the oecd proposes a range any part of which would probably make the lockdown yield a net benefit – they refer to the value of a statistical life covid19 however produces mortality disproportionately in the old and those with comorbidities so perhaps the alternative qualityadjusted lifeyear qaly approach – whereby qualityadjusted lifeyears saved are valued – should be used with as much as 20 of those over seventy who die from covid19 being likely to die within one year anyway and a qaly value of between £20–30000 a positive net benefit from lockdown becomes much less likely the second problem is deeper the policy choices relate to covid19 deaths not imaginary deaths in the past and not some medical intervention that might prolong life by one year thus what plausibly matters is how people currently value such deaths this is for two reasons first how people value health over wealth in this period obviously matters for the politics of these decisions politicians are reelected by the people who assess government performance by their own lights not by how well the government executed a manuals implicit assessment second peoples current valuation may matter because there is evidence that people are more likely to follow rules when they agree with them tyler 1990 we dont know whether this is the case for covid19 lockdown policies but if it is then the efficacy of any lockdown or its relaxation also depends on whether its movement on a health–wealth tradeoff accords with the publics relative valuation of health over wealth of course although these considerations are real they would not matter if we had reason to believe that peoples assessments in such matters were relatively constant in that case the oecds summary might apply yet we dont in fact we know such assessments are extremely sensitive to exposure to the risk in question eg gigerenzer 2014 – think of the exodus from flying in the us post911 so features specific to covid19 will influence peoples current covid related health–wealth valuation this is why we conducted a survey experiment in the uk and the us to see how people actually value health over wealth in the context of covid19 and the lockdown hargreaves heap et al 2020 the survey consists of a sequence of binary choices between pairs of health and wealth outcomes for each country the sequence is designed so that anyone who values both ‘lives saved and ‘average household income and has a preference ordering over their various combinations will switch at one point from the option that always does as well or better than the other on health to the option that does better on wealth where they switch is an indicator of their relative valuation of health over wealth and can be interpreted as giving the lower bound for the value of life the experimental element comes from asking participants to make this sequence of choices a second time after the first occasion the participants engage in another task and are then divided into three subgroups one subgroup receives an information prompt on the predicted number of covid19 deaths per million by august another receives an information prompt on the predicted loss of gdp per capita through lockdown measures in 2020 the final subgroup is our control group they hear a short piece of instrumental music instead the participants then make the decisions over health and wealth combinations again this experimental element allows us to test for the robustness of the health–wealth valuations do they change much in the control and for whether they respond in predictable ways to information on deaths and income losses in the two information treatments we find that in the peak of the pandemic in the uk and us the average implicit value of a covid19 life was extremely high by the standards of the oecd figures the average value is a factor of around ten times greater than usual this means that the lockdown policy accorded very well with the publics preferences for health over wealth at that time indeed the lockdown policies were met by increased support for the governments imposing them blais et al 2020 we also find that the individual variation in this valuation predicts individual compliance with the lockdown measures in both countries so policymakers do need to care about what the people think in this matter not just for political reasons of reelection but also because it affects the efficacy of any policy change through its influence on compliance this experimental evidence gives us a clue as to whether the valuations will change as the experience of covid19 deaths recedes and income losses mount see midoes 2020 they will on the one hand the high valuation of covid19 lives saved implies that any relaxation of the lockdown – which will produce a spike in covid19 deaths – will court unpopularity and lack of compliance on the other hand information on covid19related fatalities and growing income losses will lead people to adjust their relative valuation of health over wealth towards wealth see hargreaves heap et al 2020 in short the longer that relaxation of the lockdown is delayed people will become more tolerant of any increased deaths associated with the relaxation because income losses increase with delay this insight complements an earlier one on the gains from the delay that come from better information on how to relax a lockdown santospinot and mata 2020 moreover whilst unexpected deaths will in general put a brake on the drift to valuing wealth relatively more highly they also tend to polarise the valuations of health over wealth in the uk hargreaves heap et al 2020 this is in a context where there is already evidence of polarisation in other respects see gambacorta et al 2020 both effects reinforce the argument for caution in relaxing the lockdown because a delay will help avoid the braking and polarising effect of unexpected deaths on peoples valuation of health relative to wealth as it otherwise drifts – in both the uk and the us – towards wealth the politics of loosening and potentially retightening lockdowns are not straightforward see aksoy et al 2020 not least because standard tools employed such as information provision see fetzer et al 2020 might generate unintended consequences that undermine policy objectives at a minimum they should at least be facilitated by analyses of the publics relative valuations of health and wealth aksoy c g b

hospitals are already struggling to cope|o past week bangladesh india and pakistan have largely lifted nationwide lockdowns intended to curb the spread of covid19 the freeing of 17bn people—more than a fifth of humanity—from varied restrictions will bring relief to the regions battered economies alas it promises no relief from the pandemic itself in luckier countries stayathome rules reduced the number of new infections in south asia they managed only to moderate the diseases acceleration but not to halt it see chart the lifting of the lockdowns in turn is likely to hasten its spread again with some 350000 confirmed cases and fewer than 9000 deaths so far the regions toll looks relatively modest yet those numbers disguise both widespread undercounting and a rate of growth that was frightening even before the lifting of restrictions at the current pace the numbers are doubling every two weeks suggesting that by the end of july when some models predict the outbreak will peak the official number infected may reach 5m and the death toll could approach 150000 low levels of testing mean that the real numbers could be far worse one foreign health official in pakistan reckons the death toll is between two and three times the governments count john clemens of icddrb formerly the international centre for diarrhoeal disease research bangladesh estimates that dhaka bangladeshs capital may already have as many as 750000 cases even though the official national tally is less than 60000 in harderhit parts of the region health services are under severe strain madhuri a 46yearold nurse in thane a suburb of mumbai had been working 12hour shifts with no days off from april 1st until she herself caught covid19 from a patient in may the government hospital where she works does not treat the disease passing positive cases to designated covid hospitals but madhuri not her real name says her colleagues must instead cope with the patients those places no longer treat “we now do 6070 deliveries a day up from 4050 in normal times in addition to stab wounds accidents and so on” her hospitals 20bed intensive care unit is staffed by just two nurses and its 16bed isolation ward by just one she says her experience is far from unusual three medical interns at another hospital in the centre of mumbai recently released a video claiming that they had been left for hours in sole charge of thirtyfive seriously ill covid19 patients with no doctors nursing or cleaning staff to help another viral video revealed that corpses wrapped in plastic had been left in a covid ward full of patients owing to lack of space in a hospital morgue staff at hospitals across india have repeatedly protested against unsafe conditions poor equipment and long working hours in delhi the capital some six hundred health workers have tested positive for covid19—including three hundred and twentynine at the allindia institute of medical sciences the countrys grandest government hospital overall india has a ratio of doctors and nurses to population that is half chinas and a quarter of europes and the virus has now spread from betterserved cities to poor rural states such as jharkhand where there is one doctor for every 6000 people doctors in pakistan say the governments claim that there are adequate hospital beds is nonsense “the situation is very very unsatisfactory” says qaisar sajjad of the pakistan medical association predicting a surge in cases stemming from the recent holiday marking the end of ramadan zubair zahir head of a local doctors association in khyber pakhtunkhwa province fears its hospitals could run out of intensivecare beds and ventilators within the next two weeks the crisis has already squeezed other services despite a resurgence of polio an immunisation campaign in the province has been suspended in india treatment of endemic diseases such as tuberculosis which kills some 400000 people a year has also been impeded in normal times the regions rich can largely insulate themselves from the implications of decades of puny public spending on health “if they so much as sneeze they flee to thailand singapore or india” says a doctor at a private hospital in dhaka now she says it is “almost impossible” to gain admission to bangladeshs elite hospitals whether for covid19 or other illnesses finding places in morgues cemeteries and crematoria is also becoming a challenge at the municipal graveyard of narayanganj an area with lots of garment factories on the outskirts of dhaka a typical month sees fewer than two hundred and fifty burials last month it jumped to 575 only seventy of which were officially recorded as victims of covid19 jawahar baug the biggest crematorium in thane outside mumbai has seen a similar jump in custom it has boosted its staff from thirty to fifty men working three shifts a day while the volume of bodies they manage has grown from four to six a day to sometimes as many as 20 delhi has relaxed a ban on traditional funeral pyres made of wood instituted to reduce pollution because there are too few gasfired ovens to meet the spurt in demand inevitably the failure of all three countries to control the pandemic has led to soulsearching and blamecasting imran khan pakistans prime minister has loudly pointed out that he was never a fan of the lockdown which he had warned would hit the poor unduly hard and could only slow the disease his detractors respond that a big reason for failure was precisely the halfhearted and inept way pakistans lockdown was enforced in bangladesh inconsistent rulemaking a collapse in average income in slum areas of an estimated 75 and the mass return to villages of hundreds of thousands of garmentworkers undermined any gains from the lockdown perhaps the most egregious errors were made by indias government despite imposing the most stringent and heavily policed restrictions in the region the government failed to foresee that its measures might prompt a mass exodus from cities of tens of millions of migrant workers made suddenly destitute the authorities first tried to block the movement bottling migrants in urban slums with the highest infection rates and then allowed perhaps 20m workers to leave spreading the disease across the country in bihar a state whose 110m people are among indias poorest more than twothirds of covid cases identified so far have been among returning migrant workers whatever the cause the damage is now done farid uddin a gravedigger in the bangladeshi port city of chattogram formerly chittagong comes close to tears as he explains that he and his

lifting of coronavirus restrictions speeds up with effective end date of july 20th|taoiseach leo varadkar has said ireland has “earned the right to be hopeful about the future again” as the government dramatically accelerated the roadmap to lift coronavirus restrictions the plan to reopen the country after months of lockdown will largely end on july 20th and only comprise four phases rather than five people will be able to travel within their own counties from monday and the domestic tourism industry will reopen from june 29th in an effort to salvage some of the summer season however in recommending that ireland progress to the second phase from monday and accelerate the lifting of restrictions the national public health emergency team nphet warned that “stricter measures” may need to be reintroduced if there was an upsurge in cases of covid19 in a letter sent on thursday to minister for health simon harris dr tony holohan the chief medical officer said it was “impossible to predict with certainty what the future trajectory of the covid19 disease will be in ireland” the emergency team said the “easing of measures always has the potential to increase the risk of transmission of infection” and concerns were raised that workplaces had the potential to become “foci” for new clusters as public health measures were eased the acceleration in reopening came after two cabinet meetings on thursday night and friday morning with ministers choosing to deviate from the advice of the team on two issues the decision to allow people travel within their counties from monday and to allow shopping centres reopen albeit with restrictions on june 15th some ministers said the cabinet had taken the initiative while mr varadkar and mr harris said the team and the government had worked together mr varadkar said the third phase and the fourth final phase – which will take effect from june 29th and july 20th respectively – would be redefined in the coming weeks in a process led by nphet the taoiseach has said he wants to lift the 14day quarantine requirement for people arriving into ireland from other countries which have been successful in tackling the virus – effectively allowing irish people go on foreign holidays to certain destinations – but it is not yet clear from when this might apply government sources suggested the socalled air bridges could take effect from july 20th announcing the changes mr varadkar said “during this emergency we have suffered as a country lost loved ones and changed the way that we work and live we are making progress we are heading in the right direction and we have earned the right to be hopeful about the future again” dr holohan said the emergency team would “develop some guidance” around the twometre social distancing rules for the hospitality sector during periods of low transmission fianna fáil leader micheál martin welcomed the changes particularly the easing of restrictions on travel while sinn féin leader mary lou mcdonald said the acceleration was “great news all round” mr harris said everyone had a role to play in ensuring the country could “safely find a way to live alongside” coronavirus health service executive chief executive paul reid said now was the time for “strengthened personal vigilance” such as doing the “small hygiene things very well” minister for finance paschal donohoe and minister for social protection regina doherty also announced on friday that the wage subsidy scheme which is subsidising almost 500000 workers and the pandemic unemployment payment which ms doherty said provided help to 600000 people would continue until the end of august from june 29th the €350 weekly pandemic unemployment payment will drop to €203 for those who earned an average wage of €200 a week or less while those who earned more than €200 will still receive €350 mr donohoe said it may be the case that the wage subsidy scheme outlasts the pandemic unemployment payment but other challenges face ministers such as the request from minister for transport shane ross for a €460 million bailout for bus and rail operators whose incomes have been reduced during the pandemic|2020-06-06|0.6588|positive|0.1050906640529282|positive

between fostering economic output and keeping the spread of infection low this column reports several reopening scenarios for the uk economy documenting their projected impacts on both gdp and the spread of the virus the results suggest that it is best to reopen upstream industries first as they provide a large direct and indirect economic boost at a relatively lower cost in terms of further epidemic spreading the economic disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic are large and have affected some industries and occupations more than others koren and peto 2020 del riochanona et al 2020 for example labour supply shocks strongly affected construction but were absent in sectors considered essential yet given the interconnected nature of the economy even the sectors shielded from the direct shocks eventually face adverse consequences firstorder shocks are amplified through production networks and the interaction of supply and demand inoue and todo 2020 barrot et al 2020 mandel and veetil 2020 bonadio et al 2020 baqaee and farhi 2020 for instance in norway within a month two thirds of the layoffs happened in businesses that were not directly hit by the shocks alstadsæter et al 2020 governments that are now seeking to reopen their economies cannot ignore these network interactions to determine the relative economic boosts of different reopening scenarios they need to consider the risks of an unbalanced reopening that may worsen supply chain bottlenecks besides they must also consider that the risk of infection faced by workers varies across industries and search for an appropriate compromise between increasing economic output and controlling the epidemic spreading in a recent paper pichler et al 2020 we investigate several scenarios for the phased reopening of the uk economy by modelling production network effects explicitly at one extreme we find that reopening only a very limited number of industries can create supply chain ‘miscoordination problems that may even decrease aggregate output at the other extreme reopening all industries without extra precautionary measures would increase the epidemic reproduction number r  to above one and may cause a second wave of the epidemic our results suggest that there is a reasonable compromise that yields a relatively small increase in epidemic spreading and delivers a substantial boost in economic output in an interconnected economy it is intrinsically difficult to assess the economic impact of reopening only some industries each industry relies on other industries sometimes critically for example the metal manufacturing industry cannot operate without supplies from the mining industry opening parts of the economy without considering these relationships could cause severe supply chain disruptions we designed a novel economic model that acknowledges the unique features of the current crisis and specifically i deals simultaneously with supply and demand shocks ii allows for sluggish consumption recovery and iii incorporates sectoral inventory buffers the core of the model is an industrial production network that distinguishes between critical and noncritical inputs to determine which inputs are critical we use a survey of ihs markit industry analysts who were asked “can production continue in industry x if input y is not available for two months” our model is calibrated to the uk economy and initialised with firstorder supply and demand shocks derived in del riochanona et al 2020 validation exercises show that our model is in good agreement with recent estimates from the office for national statistics ons and is in line with the sectoral unemployment data of the us our model predicts a reduction in gdp of 17 for the first quarter and a reduction of 215 for the second quarter of two thousand and twenty compared to the last quarter of 2019 these estimates are in the range of other forecasts for the uk economy although on the more pessimistic side figure one simulation results for implementing and unwinding the uk lockdown as in most economic models the predicted outcomes depend fairly strongly on the choice of the production function we assume that noncritical inputs are not necessary to avoid the unrealistic collapse of the economy that would take place under a standard leontief model however we do assume that critical inputs are absolutely necessary and in fixed proportion leading to nontrivial network effects for instance we find the counterintuitive result that reopening only a few industries can lower aggregate output this happens because when some sectors of the economy are outputconstrained other industries compete for these scarce inputs important industries may then run out of inventory and eventually lack critical inputs to operate if reopening only a handful of selected industries can cause problems reopening should be broad enough however this can of course be very risky in terms of infections this prompted us to evaluate the effects of the reopening scenarios on r  the reproduction number of the epidemic we decompose the epidemic transmission rate into five sources of infections infections at the workplace at school during consumption activities during commuting and finally infections that are not influenced by whether or not an industry is open we also estimate the infection risk in each industry for instance the healthcare sector is responsible for more workrelated infections than the forestry sector this is because health workers have more contacts each contact has a higher infection risk and there are more healthcare than forestry workers overall as another example the retail and restaurant sectors contribute much more to consumption infections than the mining sector because there are virtually no direct consumption activities in the mining industry by splitting sources of infection by economic activity we can assess both the economic and epidemic impact of different scenarios we then use this simple epidemic model to study five reopening scenarios first to establish a proper benchmark we quantify the effect on epidemic spreading if the lockdown continues second we analyse the impact of fully reopening agriculture mining manufacturing and construction which were not entirely closed during the uk lockdown third we open all upstream industries but leave all nonessential sectors in consumerfacing industries closed retail accommodation and food recreational and personal services the fourth scenario is the same as the third but assumes that schools are fully open instead of receiving only children of workers who cannot work from home in the fifth scenario we reopen all industries for work and consumption figure two shows the economyepidemic tradeoff there is considerable uncertainty in our predictions but one conclusion appears robust a large part of the ‘upstream economy that was closed until recently tends to have a relatively lower risk for workers little risk for consumers and also has higher economic value essentially this is because large parts of manufacturing and business services have high ‘valueadded and are upstream meaning that they provide inputs to other industries also these upstream industries are rarely selling directly to consumers and thus present limited risks in their contribution to the pandemic as a result there is a ‘sweet spot in which we can reopen upstream industries but leave many consumerfacing industries closed this results in a relatively small increase in risk of infection and a significant economic boost figure two how different reopening scenarios impact r0 and gdp notes the lefthand vertical axis shows the reproduction number r0 multicoloured bars the righthand vertical axis gives the share of gdp compared to prelockdown levels blue bars as figure two makes clear the scenario “all except consumerfacing industries” increases the reproduction number only marginally but increases gdp by 8 relative to lockdown a month after these industries are reopened in contrast reopening the entire economy only increases gdp by an additional 2 thus our recommended scenario has most of the economic benefits and only minimal cost in terms of increased infections of course there remains a lot of uncertainty in many estimates and we cannot be sure that this scenario would not bring r above one similarly we cannot be sure that reopening completely would bring r above one if stringent physical distancing and environmental health measures are in place however our results do indicate that the costbenefit ratio of an industry being open is likely to be lower for upstream industries alstadsæter a b bratsberg g eielsen w kopczuk s markussen o raaum and k røed 2020 “the first weeks of the coronavirus

although most activities were reopened in may italian gdp is expected to drop by around 10 in 2020 this column argues that a targeted exit from the lockdown in italy could have been implemented instead it identifies those activities with the greatest impact on the national economy but with low risks for those returning to work and for the country at large the methodology could also be applied in other countries and in the in the unfortunate event of a new wave of contagion and a new lockdown the effects of the covidrelated lockdowns are massive see mckibbin and fernando 2020 in italy we estimate a 44 reduction in the value of potential output produced peaking at 69 for construction and real estate and 63 for mechanics activities were closed following an administrative decision of the government differently from other countries like germany or france where the lockdown was in most cases the indirect effect of social confinement barrot et al 2020 fadinger and schymik 2020 as a result gdp in italy is expected to drop by around 10 in 2020 according to most forecasts in italy most activities were reopened in may although with social distancing and health safety guidelines in this column we argue that a targeted exit from the lockdown could have been implemented instead giving priority to those activities with the greatest impact on the national economy this targeted strategy combined with an assessment of the inherent health risks of each activity as done by the government would have reduced the risks of a second wave of contagion for those returning to work and for the country at large while achieving a reactivation of gross output and jobs similar to the general reopening actually implemented in a recent paper barba navaretti et al 2020 we propose an approach to identify production activities for which total or partial closures and consequently reopening would have the greatest impact on the countrys gdp output and employment using inputoutput tables and network centrality measures in production chains our approach provides an operative tool for clearly identifying the economic effects of lockdowns at a granular level we show for example that the activation of just twenty core microsectors would raise the capacity of the italian economy as measured by the value of gross output from 56 under the administrative lockdown as of four may to 76 with respect to the precovid19 level the impact would be especially sizeable in core production chains for instance the value of gross output of mechanics would increase from 37 to 84 and of constructions from 31 to 77 we estimate that the administrative lockdown as of four may if kept for an entire year would have implied a drop in gdp of 52 the reopening of the sectors identified in our analysis would limit this fall to 16 assuming the other activities remain closed for a whole year understanding how to minimise the impact of the lockdown on the economy is of course important to design the reopening strategy but it is even more crucial in the event of having to face a possible resurgence of the covid19 pandemic or a new pandemic in the future we all wish these events would never happen but the main lesson from these tragic months is that we can no longer be unprepared in confronting them identifying core sectors of the economy is not easy because size is not the only issue given the tangled nature of value chains there are activities that may seem insignificant from a quantitative point of view but are fundamental links in several production chains and therefore have a significant indirect impact on the production capacity of the country inputoutput io tables are the starting point to unfold the interconnections among different sectors of activity a parallel strand of analysis closer to the business and management literature has developed from the concept of production or supply chains building on the seminal contribution of porter 1985 we merge these two strands of the literature integrating information from the io matrices of the italian economy produced by istat with those from the structure of the value chains of the italian economy built by prometeia in our analysis we exploit two sets of analytical tools that have been developed in the recent years the methodology to extract some sectors of economic activities from io matrices proposed by dietzenbacher and lahr 2013 and the techniques used by social network analysis to identify key players within a system jackson 2010 the tangled web of the economy to disentangle the intricacies of the italian economy we move in three steps first among the sixtythree sectors of the national io tables  we identify those in which closure causes the largest drop of gdp thus simulating the effect of their total or partial lockdown as implemented by the government decrees of twentytwo march and ten april dietzenbacher and lahr 2013 table one below lists the sectors for which a yearly closure as of italys prime minister decrees of twentytwo march and ten april 2020 would have an impact on gdp greater than 3 table one impact of one year of administrative lockdown on gdp by industry as of io tables notes the table reports the estimates of the drop in gdp caused by the lockdown of a sectors economic activities as of italys prime minister decrees of twentytwo march and ten april 2020 if kept for an entire year only sectors with an estimated drop larger than 3 of gdp are listed the size of the decline in gdp can be decomposed into three factors i the size of the sector ii the degree of interconnection between the sector and other upstream and downstream sectors and iii the degree of closure of the sector imposed by the ministerial decrees ie the larger the extent of the lockdown the larger the economic impact the sectors identified at nace two digits are large and made of heterogeneous activities at the same time activities which are relatively small and have small weights in inputoutput tables may provide crucial inputs or crucial outlets to more than one production chain hence their closure may nevertheless endanger a large share of national output this effect would not be detected by inputoutput table for this reason as our second step we revert to finer industry statistics and also to the analysis of specific production chains our units of analysis are the one hundred and ninetytwo microsectors included in production chains we focus on those included in the core nace two digits sectors identified above in table 1 we use social network analysis to study the links among each microsector and identify the most central ones within and between production chains the literature on social networks has proposed several measures to characterise the relevance of each node in addition to the number of connections we choose eigenvector centrality which estimates the relative relevance of a node within a network microsectors with a higher eigenvector centrality therefore are more relevant within each production chain and across a larger number of production chains figure one provides a representation of our network each dot represents a microsector with its size proportional to its eigenvector centrality the ‘tails in the picture represent production chains and their dots correspond to microsectors which only belong to a single production chain therefore having lower centrality values dots in the centre represent microsectors with high centrality values because they interact with many microsectors across different production chains eg wholesalers of intermediate industrial goods the microsectors are then ranked according to their eigenvector centrality we have identified three groups of microsectors a first group includes the twenty most central microsectors with a total value of production when fully open of over €820 billion 23 of the total production of the italian economy as of four may these microsectors were operating at a mere 13 of their potential output of the approximately four million people employed before the crisis just over half a million were at work on four may if these twenty microsectors were allowed to operate at full capacity the total value of output of the italian economy would rise from 56 of its potential to as much 76 nonetheless while inspecting production chains one immediately realises that in some of them eg fashion many core activities such as clothing and footwear would still remain closed making the opening up of the identified microsectors ineffective for these production chains we therefore consider a second set of the next twenty microsectors in terms of centrality which are less central than the initial 20 but still large and with a crucial role in core production chains finally by combining information on the centrality of the network with qualitative assessments regarding the articulation of the individual production chains one can also identify ten additional microsectors since they are relatively small accounting for only 39 of total production they cannot be identified by our procedure yet they are crucial enablers of entire production chains eg packaging paper for the food industry or textile finishing in fashion table two reports output capacity for each production chain measured as gross value of output compared to pre covid levels under four scenarios the administrative lockdown as of four may only essential activities are allowed  column 1 and following the opening up of the core twenty column 2 forty column 3 and fifty column 4 microsectors with just fifty microsectors operating at full capacity in addition to those deemed essential out of a total number of 192 production chains such as agrifood

fresh horrific depths a sustained upswing from the shock of covid19 will look very good for recent buyers of risk assets while leaving behind many defensively oriented portfolio managers and all around the world there are encouraging signals where stock markets are starting to catch up with the pacesetting us benchmark the sp 500 a weakening us dollar and rising commodity prices are easing shackles imposed on many emerging markets in spite of this investors have good reasons to reflect and to ask themselves hard questions namely whether current stimulus efforts can truly repair the economic damage wrought by the pandemic and whether the longterm consequences of shutdowns will prove inflationary it is reasonable for governments central banks and investors to expect that current relief programmes will bridge the gap between an end to lockdowns and an eventual recovery the current recession was triggered by a sudden hard stop in activity and those at the sharp end of this contraction such as lowpaid workers and small businesses are suffering the most even so as huge amounts of stimulus have swilled through financial markets few investors have paused to assess the ultimate effectiveness of each dollar euro and pound expended so where does this leave investors running diversified portfolios chris watling at longview economics argues that the evolution of credit conditions is a critical factor for longterm investors to watch in coming months this will determine he says whether the us and global economy is poised to enter an inflationary boom or a deflationary bust loose credit conditions will sustain the wall of money that currently drives the apparent divergence between asset prices and the state of the broader economy such looseness is good for asset returns up to a point but growing public unrest exacerbated by the pandemic raises the risk of government policies that redistribute wealth in the coming years higher taxes regulations and a more inflationary environment all pose a threat to corporate profit margins which should ultimately clip equity returns one small comfort for portfolio managers who stick mainly with stocks is the likelihood that bonds perform a lot worse given that their current low fixed rates provide scant protection in an environment of higher inflation for now credit conditions are tightening meaning that banks are taking a more restrictive approach to lending this ultimately starves weaker companies and other entities such as commercial real estate that have enjoyed ready access to cheap money over the past decade that duly heightens the deflationary challenge facing central banks at the moment and overshadows the trajectory of an eventual economic recovery nervousness over such an outcome is visible in shares of listed private equity companies which are dependent on cheap and easy debt and which have trailed the sp five hundred by some fifteen per cent during the current rebound it is also visible in junkrated debt which has lagged behind higher quality investmentgrade paper the backstopping of credit markets by central banks has certainly bought a little time for companies with junk credit ratings and those on the cusp of being downgraded from investmentgrade status but their heavy dependence on debt leaves them with few options to counter a lacklustre recovery over the next few years fiscal stimulus only bridges the gap up to a point and problems for small businesses will feed back into the economy and hurt bigger companies says mr watling that spectre of longterm damage inflicted by the pandemic explains why plenty of investors are not fully buying in to this equity market rebound it does not appear to take account of elevated levels of unemployment for example or

|coronavirus disease two thousand and nineteen covid19 is rapidly spreading all over the world one of the reasons for this quick spread is that the virus may be transmitted via aerosolize particles from asymptomatic individuals to avoid further transmission a huge amount of personal protective equipment ppe and specialized medical equipment is necessary as the pandemic evolves the shortage of these resources has become one of the biggest social problems worldwide thus we are forced to provide appropriate treatments with limited available resources acute kidney injury aki is also one of the significant complications of covid19 along with respiratory failure 1 recent retrospective studies have shown that covid19 patients who develop acute kidney injury aki have an extremely poor prognosis 234 to rescue these severe patients renal replacement therapy rrt should definitely be considered however in terms of infection control and medical resources it is much more challenging to perform hemodialysis than before the pandemic happened herein using an actual case we argue that peritoneal dialysis pd could become a more practical and safer rrt particularly during this pandemic crisis a 62yearold male with a pcr test positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus two sarscov2 developed dyspnea after admission to the depressurized room in our intensive care unit icu his oxygenation and hemodynamics rapidly deteriorated we started mechanical ventilation and administered vasopressors favipiravir and ciclesonide additionally serum creatinine became elevated day one 077 mgdl→day5 519 mgdl and his urine volume also dropped to 01 mlkgday we diagnosed him with covid19associated aki as he progressed to anuria it became difficult to control the serum potassium and the hemodynamics due to acidemia we inserted the pd catheter to the rectovesical pouch using a portable xray machine at the bedside and infused the peritoneal dialysate fig 1a–c although the anuria persisted for a while the increased amount of peritoneal dialysate easily normalized the acidemia and serum potassium level also the pd procedure did not influence the patients hemodynamics or respiratory status after the normalization of acidemia and electrolytes the vasopressors could be tapered off and the inflammation status was also improved on day 14 the patient was discharged from our icu with the pd catheter sarscov2 was detectable in the sputum but not in the peritoneum and pd waste a abdominal xray of peritoneal dialysis pd catheter arrowhead indicates the pd catheter b the pd catheter tip confirmed in the rectovesical pouch by ct scan image taken after icu discharge c actual condition of peritoneal dialysis for covid19 intubated patients generally before the covid19 pandemic continuous renal replacement therapy crrt was the first choice for rrt in hemodynamically unstable patients 5 however after the outbreak it has become difficult to allocate hemodialysis machines to covid19 patients with aki due to infection control 6 additionally crrt requires continuous health providers care and troubleshooting such as changing anticoagulants correcting poor blood drainage and responding to various sudden alarms it tragically wastes ppe and further exposes medical staff to sarscov2 infection risk meanwhile pd does not require specialized instruments and the procedure of peritoneal dialysate exchange is quite simple it could also improve the electrolyte and acidbase balance similarly as hemodialysis except for water removal furthermore as this case has shown the insertion of the pd catheter is possible even at the bedside therefore pd could be applicable to various treatment situations for severe covid19 patients including those in developing countries surely periodic dialysate exchange might become indispensable at any treatment phase however since the timing of exchange could be controllable we could exchange it at the same time as other procedures such as infusion bottle exchange and postural changes this does not lead to more waste of ppe or more explosion of medical staff to covid19 infection thus as pd relatively matches with social and technical needs more than before the pandemic it should be positively taken into consideration in this global crisis|2020-06-08|-0.9773|negative|0.09635078463203461|positive
covid19 has disrupted scientific productivity in unquantifiable ways unquestionably the biggest disruption has been felt by junior faculty however these bright young minds do not have to be sacrificed|the ensuing cuts and hiring freezes have meant that the job market for prospective junior researchers is becoming even more competitive for those who were in already in the interview process ‘chalk talks were done virtually making it harder to ‘read the room second visits were put largely ‘on ice many who have gone through the interview process are in a figurative purgatory awaiting confirmation that they will be able to start their labs in the fall those unable to find a job this year will be rolling over into an even more crowded space next year as more enter the market many postdocs whose finite contracts are coming to an end may not have the financial means to try for academic jobs year after year which will result in a permanent loss of this pool of talent for those who have managed to secure new employment not only are job start times being delayed but also there is a risk that timelimited startup funds may be partially reclaimed or blocked from extensions because scientists are locked out of their labs the collection of preliminary data is being delayed so junior researchers will have less time to generate preliminary data and less time available to transition to independence furthermore time to publication is also being delayed and independent publication is needed for earlycareer researchers to remain competitive in the search for external grants however it is not just about the datacollection time starting a lab is a grueling and timeconsuming process for a new principal investigator that requires a period of trial and error acquiring equipment consumables and a reliable library of cells samples and cultures navigating a new administrative structure recruiting and training personnel and learning what kind of a leader the principal investigator wants to be and how to narrow a research focus effectively all of these crucial stages of professional development that are paramount to the success of a new lab have been delayed this puts an impossible squeeze on the incompressible time window junior faculty have to establish a sustainable lab to manage the impact on our new colleagues we strongly encourage funding bodies in all countries such as the us national institutes of health to extend the pathway to independence grant transitions for example k99r00 grants in the usa perhaps with a nocost extension period of two years instead of one year and to continue providing at least a portion of salary support during that time for earlystage investigators who have just started their labs these agencies could grant an automatic 1year extension of earlystage investigator status to allow preferential treatment of their grants foundations could play an equally immense role by instituting creative disbursement of funds for example funds could be used to buttress startup packages that funding bodies may not be able to provide switching funds—even if only on a timelimited basis—away from awards and grants awarded to already wellfunded established investigators toward junior faculty–focused funds would be of great impact foundations with substantial endowments could also consider using their ‘rainyday funds or funds earmarked for conferences that are now cancelled to support junior faculty colleagues and senior trainees universities can also take a leadership role at this crucial time in a junior researchers development time limits for startup funds which are typically limited to three years promotion and tenure clocks should be expanded by at least a year this would go a long way toward alleviating the anxiety due to reduced productivity during this time and would reduce the risk of losing scientists in whom institutions have already invested so heavily importantly in retrospective conversations assessing the quality of junior researchers no figurative asterisk should be added indicating that it took them longer to reach an expected milestone leadership should increase virtual supports related to professional development for example virtual writing accountability groups are a great way to help junior faculty build sustainable writing habits leadership can organize these groups to meet at times that will make it easier for faculty who are now juggling caregiving and homeschooling roles to participate chairs and associate or vice deans for faculty can regularly check in with junior faculty they can also host virtual coffee chats and happy hours to promote connections and reduce isolation importantly university leadership should change the narrative from one of ‘business as usual to one that embraces grace and physical emotional mental and spiritual wellbeing during this difficult and uncertain time fellow faculty have the most crucial role in supporting junior colleagues in these troubled times measures of productivity and bars set for tenure need to be shifted with help from those who know the constraints of building a lab best for example in this pandemic younger faculty are even more likely to have childcare issues that bedevil productivity this issue disproportionately affects female faculty as shown by observable disparity in manuscript submission by women versus by men during this time senior colleagues can help by proactively introducing rotation students and potential postdoctoral fellows to their junior colleagues and by protecting junior facultys time alleviating them from committee work and teaching for example to allow them to concentrate on building their labs moreestablished researchers should advocate for funding to be directed toward those in need at the early stages of their career and chairs and senior members of a department should call for younger principal investigators to be prioritized in space title and resource allocations one of the challenges social distancing has created is the abolition of conferences conferencebased networking is essential for junior faculty and those entering the job market seminars and conferences allow a junior colleagues work to be showcased such that the community is aware of accomplishments that can be drawn on when called upon to write external letters for tenure packages as scientists are moving to virtual platforms to share their work so should proactive showcasing of their work socialmedia platforms such as twitter and online platforms for peer networks or society platforms allow a scientist to highlight the backstory and key data from recently published journal articles or preprints these are often widely shared within the scientific community and allow younger faculty to maintain connections with colleagues peer networks can provide important opportunities for virtual seminar invitations collaborative opportunities and more senior colleagues should amplify junior facultys effort in this space and should showcase the achievements of junior faculty as well as trainees such as fellowships phd qualification dissertation defenses and virtual presentations this has the benefit of advertising labs and improving career placement for trainees as well as helping junior faculty recruit to their labs by endorsing them finally and importantly our physicianscientist colleagues many of whom have traded their lab coats for scrubs have been isolated from their families and have headed into the clinics to help take care of patients with covid19 deserve a special mention those who are bravely leading the response to the pandemic on the front lines are reporting the traumatic nature of this particular pandemic for them there is no time to think about science let alone try to be productive in their research fields in any shape or form the research community needs to support them academically personally and financially perhaps again through special grants targeted to physicianscientists their immense sacrifice should not go unnoticed or unrewarded in summary this is a time like no other in recent history scientists have had to cull animal colonies and halt critical experiments and clinical trials and physicians have had to make an abrupt switch to telemedicine gearing back up to full capacity will take several months while the world awaits a vaccine in turn this delay will cause setbacks to junior faculty that may take several years to reverse to overcome these in addition to proposed financial measures and redesigning of traditional awards the research community can also be impactful collectively by revising the hallmarks for judging success over the next five years by providing virtual means of support and most importantly by preserving a pipeline for new talent the overriding message needs to be one of care of altruism and of togetherness we can and we will get through this as one

the pandemic has forced the adoption of new ways of working organizations must reimagine their work and the role of offices in creating safe productive and enjoyable jobs and lives for employees|covid19 has brought unprecedented human and humanitarian challenges many companies around the world have risen to the occasion acting swiftly to safeguard employees and migrate to a new way of working that even the most extreme businesscontinuity plans hadnt envisioned across industries leaders will use the lessons from this largescale workfromhome experiment to reimagine how work is done—and what role offices should play—in creative and bold ways changing attitudes on the role of the office before the pandemic the conventional wisdom had been that offices were critical to productivity culture and winning the war for talent companies competed intensely for prime office space in major urban centers around the world and many focused on solutions that were seen to promote collaboration densification openoffice designs hoteling and coworking were the battle cries but estimates suggest that early this april sixtytwo percent of employed americans worked at home during the crisis compared with about twentyfive percent a couple of years ago during the pandemic many people have been surprised by how quickly and effectively technologies for videoconferencing and other forms of digital collaboration were adopted for many the results have been better than imagined according to mckinsey research eighty percent of people questioned report that they enjoy working from home fortyone percent say that they are more productive than they had been before and twentyeight percent that they are as productive many employees liberated from long commutes and travel have found more productive ways to spend that time enjoyed greater flexibility in balancing their personal and professional lives and decided that they prefer to work from home rather than the office many organizations think they can access new pools of talent with fewer locational constraints adopt innovative processes to boost productivity create an even stronger culture and significantly reduce realestate costs these same organizations are looking ahead to the reopening and its challenges before a vaccine is available the office experience probably wont remain as it was before the pandemic many companies will require employees to wear masks at all times redesign spaces to ensure physical distancing and restrict movement in congested areas for instance elevator banks and pantries as a result even after the reopening attitudes toward offices will probably continue to evolve but is it possible that the satisfaction and productivity people experience working from homes is the product of the social capital built up through countless hours of watercooler conversations meetings and social engagements before the onset of the crisis will corporate cultures and communities erode over time without physical interaction will planned and unplanned moments of collaboration become impaired will there be less mentorship and talent development has working from home succeeded only because it is viewed as temporary not permanent the reality is that both sides of the argument are probably right every organization and culture is different and so are the circumstances of every individual employee many have enjoyed this new experience others are fatigued by it sometimes the same people have experienced different emotions and levels of happiness or unhappiness at different times the productivity of the employees who do many kinds of jobs has increased for others it has declined many forms of virtual collaboration are working well others are not some people are getting mentorship and participating in casual unplanned and important conversations with colleagues others are missing out four steps to reimagine work and workplaces leading organizations will boldly question longheld assumptions about how work should be done and the role of the office there is no onesizefitsall solution the answer different for every organization will be based on what talent is needed which roles are most important how much collaboration is necessary for excellence and where offices are located today among other factors even within an organization the answer could look different across geographies businesses and functions so the exercise of determining what will be needed in the future must be a team sport across real estate human resources technology and the business tough choices will come up and a leader must be empowered to drive the effort across individual functions and businesses permanent change will also require exceptional changemanagement skills and constant pivots based on how well the effort is working over time we recommend that organizations take the following steps to reimagine how work is done and what the future role of the office will be 1 reconstruct how work is done during the lockdowns organizations have necessarily adapted to go on collaborating and to ensure that the most important processes could be carried on remotely most have simply transplanted existing processes to remote work contexts imitating what had been done before the pandemic this has worked well for some organizations and processes but not for others organizations should identify the most important processes for each major business geography and function and reenvision them completely often with involvement by employees this effort should examine their professionaldevelopment journeys for instance being physically present in the office at the start and working remotely later and the different stages of projects such as being physically colocated for initial planning and working remotely for execution previously for example organizations may have generated ideas by convening a meeting brainstorming on a physical or digital whiteboard and assigning someone to refine the resulting ideas a new process may include a period of asynchronous brainstorming on a digital channel and incorporating ideas from across the organization followed by a multihour period of debate and refinement on an open videoconference organizations should also reflect on their values and culture and on the interactions practices and rituals that promote that culture a company that focuses on developing talent for example should ask whether the small moments of mentorship that happen in an office can continue spontaneously in a digital world other practices could be reconstructed and strengthened so that the organization creates and sustains the community and culture it seeks for both processes and cultural practices it is all too tempting to revert to what was in place before the pandemic to resist this temptation organizations could start by assuming that processes will be reconstructed digitally and put the burden of proof on those who argue for a return to purely physical pre–covid19 legacy processes reimagining and reconstructing processes and practices will serve as a foundation of an improved operating model that leverages the best of both inperson and remote work 2 decide ‘people to work or ‘work to people in the past couple of years the competition for talent has been fiercer than ever at the same time some groups of talent are less willing to relocate to their employers locations than they had been in the past as organizations reconstruct how they work and identify what can be done remotely they can make decisions about which roles must be carried out in person and to what degree roles can be reclassified into employee segments by considering the value that remote working could deliver • hybrid remote by exception net negative outcome but can be done remotely if needed • on site not eligible for remote work for the roles in the first two categories upskilling is critical but talent sourcing may become easier since the pool of available talent could have fewer geographical constraints in fact talented people could live in the cities of their choice which may have a lower cost of living and proximity to people and places they love while they still work for leading organizations a monthly trip to headquarters or a meeting with colleagues at a shared destination may suffice this approach could be a winning proposition for both employers and employees with profound effects on the quality of talent an organization can access and the cost of that talent we all have ideas about what a typical office looks and feels like a mixture of private offices and cubicles with meeting rooms pantries and shared amenities few offices have been intentionally designed to support specific organizational priorities although offices have changed in some ways during the past decade they may need to be entirely rethought and transformed for a post–covid19 world organizations could create workspaces specifically designed to support the kinds of interactions that cannot happen remotely if the primary purpose of an organizations space is to accommodate specific moments of collaboration rather than individual work for example should eighty percent of the office be devoted to collaboration rooms should organizations ask all employees who work in cubicles and rarely have to attend group meetings to work from homes if office space is needed only for those who cannot do so are working spaces close to where employees live a better solution in the office of the future technology will play a central role in enabling employees to return to office buildings and to work safely before a vaccine becomes widely available organizations will need to manage which employees can come to the office when they can enter and take their places how often the office is cleaned whether the airflow is sufficient and if they are remaining sufficiently far apart as they move through the space to maintain productivity collaboration and learning and to preserve the corporate culture the boundaries between being physically in the o|2020-06-08|0.9995|positive|0.14562677465903262|positive
the unrest in america has cheered its foes and globalised the struggle against racism|some might dispute whether america remains the “indispensable nation” a phrase deployed in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyeight by madeleine albright then the countrys secretary of state but it is certainly still the nation that cannot be ignored the one that in a sense sets the political weather globally so when it goes through a trauma as it has since the killing by the police of george floyd the impact is felt worldwide mr floyds death has provoked popular protests in dozens of countries it has also been an opportunity for gloating from the governments of americas foes and rivals and has been an embarrassment for its friends and allies this past weekend saw hundreds of protests not just in america but around the world on saturday in parliament square in london the largest of many demonstrations in britain tens of thousands of people braved chilly squalls and the risk of covid19 which had led government ministers to call for protests to be shunned they shouted mr floyds name chanted “black lives matter” and every now and then dropped to one knee with one clenched fist raised skyward the crowd overwhelmingly young and racially mixed mostly wore masks but paid no attention to socialdistancing constraints many regarded the danger posed by the virus as proof of their commitment to the antiracist cause their parents or grandparents might have been hurt or arrested in the battle outside the american embassy that followed a protest against the vietnam war in march 1968 but they too in their own eyes at least were putting themselves on the line they were protesting against not just violence by the american police or president donald trumps handling of the unrest but against racism at home many placards listed names of black victims of police violence in britain such as mark duggan a 29yearold whose shooting by the police in london in two thousand and eleven sparked widespread rioting they also recalled the victims of other crimes whose perpetrators had not been brought to justice such as belly mujinga a railway worker who died of covid19 allegedly after being spat at by a carrier of the virus in other countries too george floyds murder has resurrected old worries about the justice systems treatment of ethnic minorities in france for example protesters remembered adama traoré a young frenchman of malian descent who died in police custody in 2016 and brazil on sunday saw nationwide marches against president jair bolsonaro and police violence against black people including the accidental killing of a 14yearold in rio de janeiro on may 18th elsewhere representatives of entire communities have drawn parallels between their plight and that of africanamericans palestinians saw echoes of george floyds fate in the shooting by police in jerusalem on may 30th of iyad halak a 32yearold with severe autism who was apparently mistaken for somebody else in australia aboriginal activists pointed out that more than four hundred indigenous people have died in police custody since 1991 when a commission of inquiry held to investigate the problem made hundreds of recommendations to promote reconciliation between aboriginal and other australians the “black lives matter” slogan has been adopted in indonesia by indigenous people in the provinces of papua and west papua darkerskinned than many indonesians many papuans complain of widespread discrimination and hanker after independence that no country is entirely free of racism and discrimination may have restrained some politicians from commenting on americas problems its strongest critics however showed no such reticence after all american leaders rarely pull their punches china in particular relished accusing america of hypocrisy the timing was poignant on may 28th chinas parliament rubberstamped a proposal to impose a security law on hong kong that america insisted

appeared far more likely than china to deploy armoured vehicles against peaceful protesters in its national capital observed the date by meeting veterans of chinas democracy movement hu xijin editor

despotic regime tried to seize the moral high ground “demonstrators enraged by the extreme racists throng even to the white house this is the reality in the us today” claimed a spokesman quoted in the rulingparty newspaper rodong sinmun americas friends and allies by contrast have found themselves in a tight spot few want to antagonise america or mr trump so many have sought refuge in keeping their mouths shut boris johnson britains prime minister for example has been uncharacteristically taciturn on the issue and justin trudeau his canadian counterpart responded to a question about mr trumps handling of recent events with more than twenty seconds of eloquent silence before beginning his answer “we all watch in horror and consternation whats going on in the united states” before turning to racism and inequality in canada on the other hand the pressure from the streets means that western leaders cannot ignore racism either in america or at home a young generation for whom this has become

nineteen appropriately is important but requires information such as which groups in society are most affected by the pandemic this column uses data on covid19 infections and mortality for small local areas in england and wales to study the link of covid19 with socioeconomic factors the findings suggest that areas with larger households worse levels of selfreported health and a larger fraction of people using public transport have higher infection rates areas with an older population a larger black or asian population and worse levels of selfreported health have higher mortality rates particular attention should hence be paid to reducing the risk of infection on public transport when relaxing lockdown measures there is wide variation in covid19 infection rates and mortality rates across england and wales the local authority with the highest infection rate in early may two thousand and twenty was barrowinfurness in the northwest with over eight hundred covid19 cases per 100000 people nearby lancaster and south lakeland as well as the north east region around gateshead sunderland and south tyneside were further hotspots wales also has very high infection rates but this is mostly due to a higher frequency of testing compared to england the picture is different for mortality rates as of twentyfour april 2020 the local authority with the highest mortality rate was hertsmere in hertfordshire with one hundred and thirtyone deaths per 100000 people the neighbouring north london boroughs of harrow barnet and enfield also had high mortality rates out of the ten local authorities with the highest mortality six are in greater london source authors calculations using data on the number of confirmed covid19 cases from public health england updated eight may 2020 and public health wales updated six may 2020 population from ons two thousand and eighteen population estimates source authors calculations using data on the number of deaths that mention covid19 on the death certificate from the ons weekly deaths dataset up to twentyfour april 2020 health ethnicity household size and use of public transport matter two studies for new york city borjas 2020 almagro and oranehutchinson 2020 examine the correlation between covid19 infections and socioeconomic variables and find that infection rates are higher in zip codes with a larger black population with on average larger households and with more people working in occupations with a high degree of human interaction i use simple correlation and regression analysis to examine this question in england and wales looking not only at infections but also at mortality sá 2020 data on the number of deaths that mention covid19 on the death certificate are available from the office for national statistics ons at a fine level of geographic disaggregation over 7000 middle layer super output areas this allows me to include local authority fixed effects in the analysis capturing local characteristics that have not been included in the model i find that local areas that have larger households worse levels of selfreported health and a larger fraction of people using public transport have more covid19 infections per 100000 people for mortality household size and use of public transport are less important but there is a clear relation with age ethnicity and selfreported health local areas with an older population a larger black or asian population and worse levels of selfreported health have more covid19 deaths per 100000 people some of these socioeconomic factors were highlighted by aron and muellbauer 2020 who note that the number of excess deaths in london – measured as the number of deaths relative to the average number of deaths in the same period in the past five years – increased ahead of other regions probably due to high population density and a crowded public transport system which make it difficult to social distance overman 2020 points out that the economic impacts of covid19 are likely to be unequal across different areas of the uk affecting especially areas where workers cannot easily work from home the relation between selfreported health and infections and mortality suggests that encouraging a healthy lifestyle can help prevent the spread of infections and reduce mortality also as many countries now begin to relax lockdown measures policymakers should pay particular attention to reducing the risk of infection in public transport this can be done by encouraging people to use other forms of transport as is being done in the uk but also by increasing the frequency of services to avoid overcrowding businesses should also take the risk of infection in public transport into account when deciding how to get their employees back to the office working from home should continue to be encouraged when possible especially for those who have to travel to work by public transport this is particularly relevant in london where more than

but privacy and security concerns are preventing such technologies from being widely adopted this column suggests a way to ease those concerns by endowing individuals with property rights to the digital information that concerns them a ‘selfsovereign identity system could assure users that their data would be exploited only for specified purposes such as containing a pandemic the data would revert to being private property once the pandemic is over at present countries around the world face a terrible tradeoff between a health crisis and an economic crisis which can be called the ‘health–wealth tradeoff to avoid the health crisis many countries have implemented lockdowns which generate an enormous economic cost in terms of lost income and output eg portes 2020 this tradeoff could be eased substantially through contact tracing risk tracing testing isolating and treatment ‘contact tracing involves identifying people who may have come into contact directly or indirectly with an infected person the contacts of infected people can then be tested for infection those infected can be isolated and treated their contacts can be traced and so on galeotti et al 2020 implementing contacttracing would greatly reduce the need for social distancing particularly if contacttracing were supplemented by ‘risk tracing which involves dividing people into risk categories on the basis of readily available information such as age occupation residence workplace and preexisting health conditions mesnard and seabright 2020 the effectiveness of contact and risktracing can be enhanced significantly through the application of ai technologies in areas such as early warnings tracking and prediction visualisation diagnosis and prognosis monitoring crowds and treatment support eg vaishya et al 2020 if aienhanced contact and risk tracing were implemented social distancing would be necessary primarily for people who have not been tested and are in highrisk categories consequently the health–wealth tradeoff would be vastly improved because it would no longer be necessary for countries to send most of their residents into lockdown many people would return to work with social distancing regulations becoming more stringent for the more vulnerable groups for countries where contact and risk tracing is feasible people are generally willing to provide the requisite data in return for protection from infection with three provisos that others do the same that their data are used only for the purpose of containing the pandemic and that their data are adequately protected from hacking and malicious use the great interest in providing data in return for health security is exemplified by the widespread attention and positive response pwc has received for its plans to deploy an automatic contact tracing checkin app for its employees also to be made available to its clients eg leswing 20201 other companies such as locix and microshare are working on tools permitting not only people but the surfaces with which infected people have come into contact to be retraced such initiatives will help companies reopen operations after lockdown by ensuring employees workplace safety though contact tracing at the workplace is certainly welcome it is far less effective than systems providing comprehensive contact tracing throughout time and space in order for contact and risk tracing to become manageable in countries with significant infection rates it needs to be done automatically through digital technologies rather than through personal interviews apple and google have partnered to assist in contacttracing through a system that includes application programming interfaces apis and operating systemlevel technology these companies also plan to offer a bluetoothbased contacttracing platform “that would allow more individuals to participate if they choose to opt in as well as enable interaction with a broader ecosystem of apps and government health authorities” government technology 2020 the optin condition is meant to overcome privacy and security concerns as apple and google emphasise “privacy transparency and consent are of utmost importance in this effort” apple 2020 but the optin condition is expected to limit severely the uptake of this system2 optin policies produce far lower participation rates than optout policies in a wide variety of settings from organ donations to pensions this is so for a variety of wellknown reasons changing the default requires mental effort the default is usually considered the preferable or acceptable choice and people are more sensitive to losses than to gains relative to the default making them more likely to retain the default governments and businesses are increasingly using optout design to promote socially desirable outcomes in many domains though not as noted in pandemic containment eg johnson and goldstein 2003 sunstein 2017 thaler and sunstein 2008 needless to say contact tracing software is effective only when it is widely deployed the system only has a high chance of detecting when a person in the system has been in contact with an infected person if a large proportion of the population has signalemitting devices thus the applegoogle contacttracing system is widely deemed unlikely to play a major role in tackling the covid19 pandemic in many western countries the optin policy of apple and google with respect to their contacttracing app stands in stark contrast to their standard policy with regard to the use of private data for advertising purposes as well as derivative digital strategies designed to attract user attention in practice smartphones can be understood as surveillance devices used by digital network providers such as amazon apple facebook google microsoft and others to target advertising individually to users these users implicitly consent to this surveillance by agreeing to the digital services terms and conditions which they rarely attempt to read and which they would be unable to read with all hyperlinks to other relevant documents even if they wished to due to the time and effort required3 in some cases users have the possibility of opting out of some surveillance but often in return for significant loss of service currently most people are highly sensitive to the potential misuse of their data with regard to contact tracing but remain largely unaware that their smartphones are de facto surveillance devices for advertising and attentioncapturing purposes since the digital network providers earn their incomes from pursuing these purposes they have a natural incentive to keep this asymmetric awareness intact apple google and other digital network providers sensitivity to privacy and security concerns in contact tracing is understandable because policymakers are often afflicted with the same asymmetric awareness or are unwilling to address the problem of surveillance for advertising openly the central questions concerning the future of contact and risk tracing are never asked how can users be given the opportunity to share information for containing the pandemic while safeguarding their privacy and security can the degree of surveillance that is standard for advertising also be applied to saving lives to address these questions productively we need to think beyond the existing institutional framework the critical insight is simple the current obstacles to trustworthy information sharing arise from a fundamental misallocation of digital property rights in the current digital world users generally do not have property rights to the data about them not even to the data that they generate about themselves this data usually belongs to digital network providers such as apple amazon facebook google and microsoft users are free to leave these networks but information about users remains in the hands of the networks4 in the absence of individual digital property rights it is not surprising that users are highly concerned about the privacy and security of their data living in a world in which much of the data about themselves are not in their own hands they are understandably worried about the possibility of making these data available to a new set of decision makers including government agencies fighting the pandemic after all it is difficult to assure them that data which do not belong to them will not be used by third parties for other purposes the straightforward way of tackling this problem is to give users residual property rights to the digital information about them this solution is feasible and implementable people can be made ‘sovereign over their digital identities ie the information representing them by implementing a ‘selfsovereign identity system whose properties have been wellexplored der et al 2017 tobin and reed 2017 the economic implications of a selfsovereign identity system are described in snower 2018 in such a system each person is given a private digital key to certified encrypted data about himself or herself for a potentially unlimited number of recipients who can access the data provided that they have the corresponding public key the system can be implemented through distributed ledger applications such as blockchain and smart contracts eg jacobovitz 2016 meitinger 2017 these applications permit search for decentralised identifiers without centralised directory so that data can be authenticated with decentralised verifiable credentials digital identities need to be persistent portable interoperable

influential model judged reproducible — although software engineers called its code horrible and a buggy mess|“totally unreliable” “a buggy mess” over the past month software engineers have sharply criticized the code underpinning an influential coronavirus simulation by scientists at imperial college london one of several modelling exercises that helped sway uk politicians into declaring a lockdown some media articles even suggested that the simulation couldnt be repeated by others — casting further doubt on the study now a computational neuroscientist has reported that he has independently rerun the simulation and reproduced its results and other scientists have told nature that they had already privately verified that the code is reproducible the successful code testing isnt a review of the scientific accuracy of the simulation produced by a team led by mathematical epidemiologist neil ferguson but it dispels some misapprehensions about the code and shows that others can repeat the original findings the new test is the best possible verification of fergusons simulations given the state of the art in computational science says konrad hinsen a computational biophysicist at the french national research agency cnrs in paris who was not involved in the work in may he wrote in a blogpost that the imperial studys code looked horrible but that such shortcomings are to be expected in code written by scientists who usually arent specialists in software development released in midmarch the original study suggested there could be half a million uk deaths if nothing were done to stop the virus and modelled how various policy interventions might help but imperial scientists did not immediately make the code available for public scrutiny when a cleanedup version was released at the end of april software engineers disparaged its quality and said the simulation needed to be repeated by others in may david davis a member of parliament with the united kingdoms governing conservative party tweeted about some of the online criticism saying that if true it was “scandalous” media articles cast further doubt on the imperial work by reporting online comments suggesting that other scientists had experienced problems rerunning the code nature has now ascertained that these were taken out of context they related to work done with the imperial group to ensure that the publicly released code ran correctly in every possible computing environment ferguson — who didnt comment on the criticisms at the time — agrees that the simulation didnt use current bestpractice coding methods because it had to be adapted from a model created more than a decade ago to simulate an influenza pandemic there was no time to generate new simulations of the same complexity from scratch he says but the team has used more modern coding approaches in its other work however none of the criticisms of the code affects the mathematics or science of the simulation he says the politicized debate around the imperial code demonstrates some of the reasons that scientists might still hesitate to openly release the code underlying their work researchers say academic programs often have shortcomings that software engineers can pick at even so scientists ought to release their code and document how it works says stephen eglen the neuroscientist at the university of cambridge uk who reran the imperial code and reported his results on one june this year eglen cofounded an organization called codecheck to help evaluate the computer programs behind scientific studies his work tests whether an independent scientist can reproduce the results of a computational analysis given its data inputs and code he didnt review the epidemiology that went into the imperial simulation — such as estimates of the fatality rate associated with the new coronavirus or of how often individuals typically mix in societies british science advisers however asked multiple teams to model the emerging pandemic and they produced results similar to imperials researchers working with londons royal society as part of an effort called rapid assistance in modelling the pandemic ramp have told nature that they also privately ran exercises to verify the code in march after the original imperial study was posted online ramp researchers worked with fergusons team and software firms microsoft and github to improve the clarity of documentation and clean up the software for public release on the github website a central repository where developers including scientists share code as part of this effort they checked that the public and original code reliably produced the same findings from the same inputs the ramp groups work included a separate effort to test the robustness of the simulation by trying to break it under various operating conditions says graeme ackland a physicist at the university of edinburgh uk the team involved including software specialists at edinburgh and at europes particlephysics laboratory cern near geneva switzerland posted comments on github as they went it was these comments that newspaper articles erroneously quoted as casting doubt on whether the code could be reproduced although some journals now ask peer reviewers to rerun and verify code sharing it publicly is still far from an academic norm the amount of time researchers have to spend either helping people use their software or refuting claims stemming from its misuse is a “big worry” among many academics says neil chue hong founding director of the software sustainability institute in edinburgh “there are ways you can run the code that mean you wont get sensible results but the researchers who use the code know what those ways are” he says “its like you or me being given a formula one racing car and being surprised when it crashes when it goes around the first corner” despite this code is the substance of any computational study and ought always to be released says eglen other scientists have also called for more transparency around the code underlying covid19 models in general through codecheck eglen has verified the results of two other covid19 models by researchers at the london school of hygiene  tropical medicine who posted their code with their studies asked whether hed learnt any lessons from the furore over his teams code ferguson emphasized to nature how fast the work had to be done on twentyseven february he presented basic estimates of the impact of the pandemic at a private meeting of the united kingdoms main scientific advisory group for emergencies according to minutes released at the end of may his figures already gave estimates of half a million deaths his team then worked long days to quickly produce the more complex simulations estimating how some policy actions might change the result cleaning up and releasing the code was not a top priority at the time he

the contribution of partners and families to scientists work is often overlooked it should be acknowledged and supported more|the lone genius working tirelessly on the research questions they have devoted their life to remains a prominent image in our culture both within and outside of academia portraits of such characters therefore tend to underline their dedication perhaps through endearing anecdotes of absentmindedness in the face of realworld chores such as housework and childcare when looked at from a different point of view however they also remind us of the oftenunacknowledged support provided by scientists partners and families that makes such absorption possible in the first place inevitably this issue is embedded in our social conventions and the manner in which our public and private spheres intersect consider how the neuroscience pioneer santiago ramon y cajal viewed the issue over a century ago “for the man of science the aid of a wife is just as necessary in youth as in old age” he wrote in his advice for a young investigator to him and no doubt to most people in europe at the time a good wife was essential for running the household and taking care of the children so that the husband could pursue his scientific discoveries “free from anxiety” ramon y cajal explicitly stated his belief that because of her sacrifice the wife also deserved the fame derived from a scientific discovery but the point is that for many women especially in the past this kind of support was all they were ever allowed or able to provide and they did indeed make a difference most societies have undergone profound changes since the time of ramon y cajal and with this we have seen a pronounced shift in the role that wives and partners can play in science and indeed in society as a whole at least in principle for one thing women can choose to pursue a career in research yet we continue to grapple with the tensions between what is possible in principle and what is doable in practice for example the way support is distributed in families continues to be split across gender lines preliminary evidence shows that women have been disproportionately affected by the lockdowns put in place as part of the response to the covid19 pandemic viglione g nature httpsdoiorgdwdw 2020 with preexisting inequalities in the distribution of house work and care responsibilities exacerbated it is therefore no wonder that women in such circumstances are unable to remain as productive with their work and further down the line this is likely to have an impact on job and promotion applications to take this into account the condensedmatter physicist athene donald has proposed that researchers with caring responsibilities should be able to claim an allowance of one paper or book chapter for every month of lockdown donald a occams typewriter httpsgonaturecom2zoe5hg 2020 considering personal circumstances in this way could be an initial step to mitigate the adverse effects that the pandemic is likely to have on individuals careers looking beyond the current crisis it seems clear that achieving an equal distribution of support between genders can only come with the cooperation of men societal expectations for men to be careerdriven and for women to be carers are still strong but if more men are willing to take on a primary parental role and share the mental load of housework this can set an example and gradually change the expectation that childcare and chores are predominantly womens issues these changes can only happen with the help of universities — and for that matter all employers — which can and should play a role in recognizing the issue by implementing helpful and enlightened policies for example academics with childcare responsibilities can also benefit from small grants that pay for a carer or partner to travel with them to a conference in one instance that gained attention on social media alicia kraay a postdoctoral researcher then based at the university of michigan was able to attend and chair a session at a conference shortly after having a child after her institution paid for her husbands travel so that he could look after their child and she was able to nurse in between talks a common expectation is for academics to be able to move across the world especially early in their careers for the researcher with a partner this means choosing between leaving the family and network of support behind or moving together which can come at a high personal cost for their partner and is likely to impact their career one small way to address the latter issue is to fly both the researcher and their partner for the job interview when researcher kaitlin cook applied for a faculty position at the facility for rare isotope beams at michigan state university the hiring institution paid for her wifes travel allowing her to get a sense for her career options and a feel for the town the products of house labour childcare and emotional support are a lot less visible compared to a scientific publication or a grant award yet they are a crucial component to any researchers life some will have mostly benefited from that support whereas others will have dedicated huge parts of their lives providing it to others acknowledging the value and importance of this support and recognizing that there are differences in how it is and indeed could be distributed is the first step for a fairer and altogether more inclusive academic environment|2020-06-08|0.9978|positive|0.1317960426179604|positive

unconventional fiscal policy in the form of a sudden drop in vat the aim is to create a future path of increasing sales taxes by increasing prices and hence stimulating inflation expectations and aggregate demand today this column argues that earlier episodes have shown that unconventional policy is effective because it is easily understood by nonexpert households and households react to it strongly alternative unconventional measures instead such as forward guidance are largely ineffective in part because households do not understand what such policies imply for their consumption as many economies are planning a slow reopening after the covid19 containment measures the question of how to jumpstart the economy and stimulate aggregate demand has taken centre stage furman 2020 when conventional monetary policy is constrained and high debt burdens limit the scope of conventional fiscal policy unconventional policies enter the policy toolbox on three june 2020 the german government released the measures that will constitute an unprecedented €130 billion stimulus plan the most unexpected and prominent measure is a form of unconventional fiscal policy feldstein 2002 dacunto et al 2016 2018 whereby the government changes vat rates to create a future path of increasing sales taxes and hence stimulate inflation expectations and spending at impact germany will implement an unexpected sudden and temporary drop in vat starting in july two thousand and twenty until the end of 2020 which will increase households expected inflation for two thousand and twentyone and hence should stimulate spending for the rest of 2020 until prices increase again the same exact effect could also be obtained by preannouncing a future increase in vat without first cutting the tax both measures incentivise households to move their spending forward as long as vat is lower although the measures differ in terms of implications for government budgets unconventional fiscal policy is part of a set of nonconventional policies designed and implemented to tackle the main conundrum of the euro area since the great recession stimulating inflation expectations and ultimately aggregate demand in a setting in which traditional monetary policy measures are not viable and governments can barely support growth with fiscal spending because of their large debttogdp ratios another popular unconventional policy that has entered the standard toolbox of many central banks is forward guidance – central banks explicit commitment to keep interest rates low until after the end of a liquidity trap which will generate inflation then and hence should increase inflation expectations today in theory unconventional fiscal policy and forward guidance act through the same channels they both aim to increase households inflation expectations in times in which the effective lower bound on nominal rates binds and hence changes in inflation expectations should translate onetoone into changes in perceived real rates by households because households perceive lower real interest rates their incentives to save decline and their willingness to consume should increase based on the consumer euler equation these channels are unconventional in the sense that policymakers aim to manage households behaviour directly as opposed to changing the incentives of financial intermediaries and firms and transmitting policy measures indirectly to households despite the same theoretical channels in the aggregate forward guidance seems to have been ineffective del negro et al 2015 and only scant evidence exists to assess the effectiveness of unconventional fiscal policy dacunto et al 2019 given the prominence of these measures to jump start the economy after the covid19 crisis in this column we discuss whether any of these policies appears to have been successful using the same identical microdata and surveys for both policy measures figure one reports the central findings in dacunto et al 2020 using data from the harmonised european commission consumer confidence survey for germany the figure compares german households reaction to a measure of unconventional fiscal policy in two thousand and five and two forward guidance announcements in 20132014 figure one inflation expectations and readiness to spend on durables german households the top panels report the fraction of the german population expecting higher inflation over the following twelve months the bottom panels report their average willingness to purchase durable goods the left panels plot these measures for the unconventional fiscal policy episode in november 2005 the german government unexpectedly announced a rise in vat from 16 to 19 but the increase was only effective in january two thousand and seven and hence the government engineered a path of future price increases the right panels plot these measures for the first two explicit forward guidance announcements by former ecb president draghi in july two thousand and thirteen and january 2014 although theoretically both policies should raise households inflation expectations and spending on impact only unconventional fiscal policy has produced these outcomes in the micro data forward guidance announcements do not appear to manage expectations or spending plans the raw data timeseries evidence in figure one is interesting but any unobserved shock contemporaneous to the policy announcements could explain those dynamics methodologically we need a scientific approach that helps reduce the endogeneity concerns inherent to these policy measures we propose an identification strategy in the spirit of poterba 1996 in which other eu consumers not exposed directly to the german vat shock andor to the ecb measures of forward guidance act as counterfactual for the behaviour of germans had the policy announcements not happened because different households with different demographics react differently to changes in inflation expectations bachmann et al 2015 we match german households to similar foreign households based on observables moreover our data allow us to control directly for important determinants of spending plans such as households income expectations financial outlook employment status and housing choices figure two plots the average treatment effect ate of the unconventional fiscal policy announcement on durable purchases top panel and of forward guidance bottom panel we find no differences in the readiness to spend on durable goods between german and matched households before the announcement of the vat change starting in december 2005 after the future vat change was announced german households willingness to spend increased relative to matched households german households were 38 percentage points more likely to declare it was a good time to purchase durable goods after the announcement relative to before and to matched foreign households the effect increased in magnitude throughout two thousand and six and peaked at thirtyfour percentage points in november 2006 the average treatment effect dropped to zero in january two thousand and seven once the vat increased and higher inflation materialised for forward guidance instead we find no difference in the readiness to spend on durable goods between german and matched households before the first forward guidance announcement in july 2013 germans propensity to spend did not change after the first forward guidance announcement relative to before and relative to matched foreign households even around the second announcement in january 2014 the announcement had no effect on the willingness to spend the propensity to spend did not move after the second announcement either ultimately forward guidance announcements had no effect on impact nor delayed indirect effects through financial intermediaries such as due to an effect of lower longterm interest rates on creditfinanced consumption given the novelty of unconventional fiscal policy we now discuss in more detail its features and intellectual background feldstein 2002 introduced the notion of unconventional fiscal policy measures at times of liquidity traps among several possible interventions he proposed a series of preannounced increases in vat to generate consumer price inflation and hence increase private spending via intertemporal substitution in his words “this vat taxinduced inflation would give households an incentive to spend sooner rather than waiting until prices are substantially higher” the intuition for this proposal is based on a simple logic announcing higher prices in the future – either with a sudden but temporary cut or with an outright future increase in vat – will increase current inflation expectations higher inflation expectations at times of fixed nominal interest rates should reduce real interest rates fisher equation and lower real interest rates should increase households incentives to consume rather than save euler equation because imposing higher vat reduces households wealth especially poorer households wealth and might affect households labour supply lower income taxes or transfers to those households that do not pay any income tax should accompany the increase in vat designing such a measure with a sudden but temporary vat cut with a prespecified date in which the vat will revert back to its original level is exactly what the german administration announced as part of their €130 billion stimulus package a preannounced tax increase and a sudden temporary drop in vat differ in terms of budget neutrality the former policy is budget neutral for the government if paired with income tax cut or even generates revenues whereas the latter policy creates budget deficits in both cases unconventional fiscal policy incentivises households to consume immediately jumptart the economy and hence help the economy|2020-06-08|0.9985|positive|0.10850092829544883|positive

it has arranged for a comprehensive schedule of greyhound trials to commence on eight june at all fourteen greyhound tracks with the intention of returning to racing behind closed doors early in the week commencing fifteen june shops most retailers are reopening  but not all penneys will not begin reopening stores until twelve june shopping centres can only reopen from fifteen june opening times

city council said it does not operate supervised playgrounds and pending further clarification its playgrounds will not reopen from monday there will be a new summer education programme for children with special educational needs and disadvantaged children minister for education joe mchugh will bring proposals to government on this next week work the advice remains to work from home where

will commence reopening international travel all nonessential overseas travel to and from ireland should be avoided passengers arriving from overseas are expected to selfisolate for fourteen days advice for cocooners if you are over seventy or medically vulnerable continue to stay home as much as possible you may welcome small numbers of people to your home but maintain social distancing when out shopping you are advised to use the times specially allotted by retailers if you are visiting someone who is over seventy or medically vulnerable be extravigilant two metre social distancing this remains the public health advice nursing homes limited nursing home visits will be allowed from fifteen june under certain circumstances drinking and eating bars with or without restaurant licences as long as they serve food can reopen with table service only and restaurants will reopen alongside hotels the taoiseach said detailed guidance will be published next week for hotels bars restaurants chief medical officer dr tony holohan when asked if people had to eat a meal if they were going to be in a pub said that a few fellas getting together for a few pints and having a packet of peanuts does not constitute a meal in a restaurant he said people had to be sensible and not congregate at a bar they had to sit down and be served dr holohan said most irish people know the difference between a restaurant and a pub and he felt they would be sensible health minister simon harris says there will be a clear timeline on resumption of screening programmes expected by the end of june

risk of transmitting coronavirus phase four 20 july  this is now the final phase hair salonsbarbers at present they will not reopen until this phase all bars back pubs that do not serve food can reopen however brian foley from the vintners federation of ireland has warned that many will remain shut if the two metre social distancing advice remains this is because it would reduce capacity by up to 87 of standing customers and 65 of those seated in a typical bar layout so it would simply not be viable for many pubs to run a business socialising a slightly larger number of people  the exact

the scientific community should agree on the essential information to be provided when pulling a paper from the scientific literature|this month both the new england journal of medicine and the lancet retracted controversial studies testing covid19 treatments neither noted the part that public critique played these are not the first papers and preprints related to the pandemic to be pulled often with sparse explanation the blog retraction watch has set up a tally retractions are essential to keep the scientific literature trustworthy but the notices for them are inconsistent and often uninformative that prevents people from assessing papers and strategies to promote integrity it also stigmatizes honest errors including more information could help last year i analysed more than 2000 retraction notices culled from more than 20000 listed on retraction watch and by major publishers qh vuong learn publ 33 119–130 2020 a little more than half did not say who initiated the retraction around 10 gave no reason some simply read “this paper has been retracted” there have been many suggestions for improvements including replacing retractions with postpublication amendments to the paper or with complicated taxonomies of errata corrections selfretractions partial retractions retractions with replacements and refutations or removals the rate of retractions has increased worldwide over the past few years but none of these ideas has caught on a more manageable perhaps intermediate step would be to outline four pieces of information that should be provided with any retraction specifically who initiated it the cause such as severe errors plagiarism or fraudulent practices whether there is consensus between editors and authors about it and whether postpublication review such as comments on pubpeer was involved these steps would in my opinion prompt researchers and institutions to encourage retractions when warranted right now stigma keeps researchers from admitting their mistakes yet multiple examples show that researchers who act to correct mistakes are lauded rather than shamed witness the reaction this year to the retraction of a paper on using enzymes in chemical synthesis by nobelprizewinning chemist frances arnold the retraction notice identified the cause and initiator allowing readers to appreciate the honesty and selfcorrecting spirit of a worldrenowned team of scientists if such transparency were routine it might ease the pain of retraction and increase the publics understanding of how science works it is more than a decade since the first formal call for retractions to be more informative in 2009 the committee on publication ethics cope issued guidelines recommending among other things that publishers state who is retracting the article and why retraction watch issued a similar wishlist in 2015 my analysis which looked at notices from one thousand nine hundred and seventyfive to 2019 was unable to detect any change in practice since cope issued its guidelines because nearly 97 of the retractions in my sample were from two thousand and nine or later but it is safe to say that publishers fall short of the ideals perhaps a simple format would be easiest to adopt even so implementing the fourcomponent retraction notice would be difficult the second component stating a cause is probably the most tricky although editors decide whether to retract a paper it is usually research institutions that investigate whether misconduct has occurred these investigations are often slow and inconclusive so journals often substitute safer blander terms such as error loss of data or replication failure a publicationintegrity checklist published earlier this year might help it is a series of questions such as whether a study could plausibly be done as described and could be used to pinpoint problems without requiring a formal declaration of misconduct a grey et al nature 577 167–169 2020 scientists reveal what they learnt from their biggest mistakes here the third component of the retraction notice comes in this makes clear that editors and authors can provide different reasons for the retraction rather than having to agree on the final wording the fourth component stresses the role of the users of research in safeguarding the literature and gives credit for this process the people who flagged problems can stay unidentified if they wish and editors or institutions should explain what they did to investigate i think reform in retraction processing would promote best practice fourcomponent notices would offer publishing norms especially for emerging economies and transparency could allow researchers and editors everywhere to learn about mistakes and misconduct that warrant retractions as well as the grey areas of disagreement furthermore journals should mandate that every paper carry a section about its limitations that is free to read like an abstract a formal statement of shortcomings should keep authors and the public from overstating a studys claims but fewer than 9 of papers in my analysis had such a section making such disclosure mandatory could prevent embarrassment and more importantly help to reverse the idea that studies that seem ‘conclusive or ‘clean are more important than transparent research narratives retractions expose flaws and possibly misconduct in research but also show that the errordetection mechanism is working well with this understanding we must rehabilitate the term retractions are not intrinsically bad they are a practical way to correct for human fallibility and strengthen the scientific enterprise|2020-06-08|0.9931|positive|0.10442625007842399|positive

populists claiming to be the voice of those who have been ‘left behind this column presents a new framework which could help shed light on the relationship between sustainable development and populism progress on the sustainable development goals may be associated with diminishing electoral support for populism but humanity must still get better at turning the tradeoffs between sdgs into synergies during the covid19 recovery an effective way to prevent populists from exploiting the crisis may involve making the sdgs the policy blueprint this column is a lead commentary in the voxeu debate on populism in the academic literature as well as within the voxeu debate a number of reasons for the recent rise of populism have been brought forward for an overview of the literature see norris and inglehart 2018 however no study has yet looked systematically at the relationship between the rise of populism on the one hand and the historic agenda two thousand and thirty for sustainable development on the other to address this gap we recently introduced the first systematic classification of sustainable development goals sdg performance and populism kroll and zipperer 2020 we performed the first empirical analysis of the relationship between populism and the sdgs by examining how countries have progressed on the sdgs over time and how their development in terms of sustainability relates to subsequent electoral support for populism we used data from the sdg index and dashboards sachs et al two thousand and nineteen and wwwsdgindexorg which provides “the most comprehensive picture of national progress on the sdgs and offers a useful synthesis of what has been achieved so far” nature sustainability 2018 the sdgs provide a new and enlarged understanding of sustainability as an economic social and environmental challenge the goals are firmly rooted in the concept of sustainable development ie “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” brundtland commission 1987 sachs 2015 they comprise seventeen goals and one hundred and sixtynine targets that span a range of topics from ending extreme poverty sdg 1 to affordable and clean energy sdg 7 or a global partnership for the goals sdg 17 un 2015 see figure 1 what makes pursuing the sdgs a particularly challenging task is the fact that these goals have at present antagonist tendencies among themselves in other words there are numerous tradeoffs between sdgs such as between reducing poverty and climate action which in the future will need to be turned into mutually reinforcing synergies in order to achieve a “virtuous cycle of sdg progress” kroll et al 2019 colleagues and i have performed a first analysis of future interactions for projected sdg trends until two thousand and thirty within and between goals we analysed how tradeoffs and synergies have evolved globally in the recent past we found an alarming inability to overcome certain persistent tradeoffs as well as the deterioration for some sdgs these findings seriously threaten the achievement of the agenda two thousand and thirty ibid in order to enable a structured and finegrained interpretation of the nexus between sustainability and populism in future research and policy debate we have recently proposed a sustainability–populism framework kroll and zipperer 2020 see figures two and 3 it elaborates on the four possible outcomes for the relationship between sdg performance over time and subsequent electoral support for populism • quadrant i “disillusioned performers” sdg improvement rising populism the countries named “disillusioned performers” have been making progress towards the sdgs however populist parties were able to gather increased support eg by capitalising on potential fear of regress or scapegoating towards minorities • quadrant ii “failing prey to populists” sdg deterioration rising populism countries in this category have been failing to advance on the sdgs and they are falling prey to populists and the political recipes they propose • quadrant iii “resilient believers in liberal democracy” sdg deterioration falling populism even though the situation with regard to the sdgs has deteriorated over the last years countries in this group keep their faith in traditional mainstream parties and the solutions they propose to overcome the challenges • quadrant iv “consolidating achievers” sdg improvement falling populism these countries have been making progress towards the sdgs and the calls by populists to steer in a different direction are not heeded by voters the sdgs as an answer to populism for illustrative purposes of the frameworks analytical value we examined data on sdg progress and populist vote shares that were available for thirtynine countries sdg progress data for two thousand and ten – 2015 although due to a time lag the raw data sometimes precede that period populist vote share data represent the change from secondlast to last election with the last election mainly taking place between two thousand and fifteen and two thousand and eighteen for details see kroll and zipperer 2020 most countries fall into quadrant i and iv in other words while most of the countries examined have experienced progress towards the sdgs they differ in terms of whether the electorate has subsequently turned to populists or not a number of countries have also experienced sdg regress and subsequently seen an increase in electoral support for populists quadrant i almost no countries can be found in quadrant iii with greece being an exception where possibly a disillusionment with populists has meant that voters turned away from them an additional analysis for each sdg separately can be found in the paper as political systems in many nations continue to be faced with growing populist parties our analysis sheds some light onto examples where mainstream political parties prevailed as unchallenged political hegemons in light of their good performance on economic social and environmental sdgs a particularly promising avenue for future research may be dissecting the political discourses in the countries where populists have triumphed despite progress towards the sdgs being made quadrant i “disillusioned performers” and what differentiates such a political discourse from that taking place in countries of the other categories especially the “consolidating achievers” group in other words why does success on the sdgs result in diminishing support for populists in certain countries but not in some others in order to further explore the nature of the statistical relationship between the two concepts beyond the aforementioned framework we also performed a linear regression analysis we thereby examined the sdg performance over time as a potential determinant of the populist vote share in the subsequent election we find a significant negative effect of overall sdg country performance over time on the change in populist vote share controlling for gdp per capita change ppp for each onepoint increase on the aggregate sdg index out of 100 the vote share of populist parties on average drops by about two percentage points we also find significant negative effects of progress in sdg one no poverty sdg two zero hunger sdg eleven sustainable cities and communities and sdg fifteen life on land the effect sizes vary as follows for each onepoint increase on the sdg one indicator out of 100 the vote share of populist parties on average drops by about 03 percentage points while for sdg two it drops by about 24 percentage points for sdg 11 the drop is by about one percentage point and for sdg fifteen by about half a percentage point figure three the sustainability–populism framework with data for thirtynine countries making the sdgs the blueprint for the covid19 recovery as countries are now beginning to organise the recovery after covid19 many commentators have expressed concerns that the hardship associated with the crisis might be exploited by populists in numerous countries potentially leading to a new wave of electoral support for populism the lessons from recent findings discussed here lend support to the notion that a strong commitment to the sdgs overall as well as in particular to the sdgs 2 11 and 15 could be part of an appropriate and effective answer to populism the sdgs would therefore be a very suitable blueprint for the covid19 recovery brundtland g 1987 “report of the world commission on environment

analysis of past recoveries shows a lowcarbon reboot matters more for climate than does the brief emissions crash|the most precipitous contraction of the global economy in a century has seen carbon emissions plummet by the end of this year emissions are likely to be 8 less than in twenty thousand one hundred and ninetyone — the largest annual percentage drop since the second world war see gonaturecom3gej8th to avert a global recession governments are injecting trillions of dollars into stimulating their economies the international monetary fund anticipates economic recovery by the end of this year provided there are no further large outbreaks of disease2 if nothing else changes then emissions will tick upwards once more as they have after each recession since the first oil shock of the early 1970s the analysis we present here examines past recoveries to find lessons that help to plot a lowcarbon path out of this one breaking the historical iron law that links economic growth to carbon emissions requires energy supplies to be decarbonized and is essential to stop global warming but we must be honest nothing in history suggests that emissions can drop fast enough to limit warming to 15 °c above preindustrial levels — an aspirational goal of the paris agreement which is up for review over the next few years this would mean cutting emissions by an amount similar to that delivered by the current economic catastrophe every year for the next decade3 we need more pragmatic goals the way in which governments spend stimulus monies now will dictate how global warming plays out views differ some political analysts hope that the covid19 pandemic will be a wakeup call that catalyses political action4 — a blunt reminder that the largest threats to prosperity such as climate change require respect for science and global engagement others see the opposite national governments turning inwards narrowing their focus to immediate concerns such as securing health jobs and the economy rather than the planet so far the latter approach seems to be winning5 rather than boosting green investment in the past ten weeks the united states mexico south africa and other nations have relaxed laws controlling pollution and standards for vehicle energy efficiency the us rollback on fuel economy rules finalized in march will commit the nation to higher transport emissions — now the largest source of warming gases in the united states — for a decade or more thats worrisome because carbon dioxide lingers in the atmosphere for more than a century the longterm trajectory of emissions over many years determines how much co stock accumulates a brief lull is instructive but we must urgently build on it to limit longterm warming in this crisis any climatemitigation plan must deliver on the publics immediate needs or it will not fly luckily there are sweet spots that can deliver and save hundreds of thousands of jobs6 — such as investing in renewables and energy efficiency and preserving the existing fleet of zeroemission nuclear power plants climate activists and analysts recognize that massive government spending can be channelled to their favoured causes as happened in the economic stimulus after the financial crisis of 20087 what they have not grasped is just how severely the politics have shifted — away from longterm aspirations such as protecting the climate for the decades ahead and towards restoring jobs and wealth right now without political realism this opportunity for green recovery will be squandered in terms of scale the ongoing recession already exceeds any weve seen in modern times unemployment in the united states hard to measure because it is soaring so quickly was 16 last month and is still rising about onequarter of the us workforce didnt have jobs at the peak of the great depression in the 1930s history doesnt repeat itself but as many have said it often rhymes the world has experienced five major economic shocks since the first oil crisis which began in late one thousand nine hundred and seventythree see ‘shock and recovery four of these slowed the rise of emissions for example our analysis shows that during the recovery from the second oil crisis which began in 1979 emissions growth fell by onethird they went from 36 per year during 1976–79 to 24 per year during 1983–90 the next big recession was triggered by the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 it saw the trajectory flatten by another onethird to 16 per year during 1994–97 the one thousand nine hundred and ninetyeight asian financial crisis was the exception after a short recession emissions growth doubled during a decade of rapid industrial expansion this was the period of the phenomenal rise of china which promoted heavy manufacturing and exports all fuelled by coal historys rhythm skipped as the global economic order shifted it returned with the next shock after the global financial crash of 2008 emissions growth halved to 16 per year over the next decade indeed the past decade has seen the longest period of flattened emissions since the second world war this era coincided with sustained economic growth it is politically easier for governments to focus on longterm goals such as climate change as many governments did when economies are expanding furthermore up to 15 of the global stimulus funding injected after the two thousand and eight financial crisis went into developing and deploying green technologies7 how the coronavirus pandemic slashed carbon emissions — in five graphs the united states invested in smart meters and

analysis of past recoveries shows a lowcarbon reboot matters more for climate than does the brief emissions crash|the most precipitous contraction of the global economy in a century has seen carbon emissions plummet by the end of this year emissions are likely to be 8 less than in twenty thousand one hundred and ninetyone — the largest annual percentage drop since the second world war see gonaturecom3gej8th to avert a global recession governments are injecting trillions of dollars into stimulating their economies the international monetary fund anticipates economic recovery by the end of this year provided there are no further large outbreaks of disease2 if nothing else changes then emissions will tick upwards once more as they have after each recession since the first oil shock of the early 1970s the analysis we present here examines past recoveries to find lessons that help to plot a lowcarbon path out of this one breaking the historical iron law that links economic growth to carbon emissions requires energy supplies to be decarbonized and is essential to stop global warming but we must be honest nothing in history suggests that emissions can drop fast enough to limit warming to 15 °c above preindustrial levels — an aspirational goal of the paris agreement which is up for review over the next few years this would mean cutting emissions by an amount similar to that delivered by the current economic catastrophe every year for the next decade3 we need more pragmatic goals the way in which governments spend stimulus monies now will dictate how global warming plays out views differ some political analysts hope that the covid19 pandemic will be a wakeup call that catalyses political action4 — a blunt reminder that the largest threats to prosperity such as climate change require respect for science and global engagement others see the opposite national governments turning inwards narrowing their focus to immediate concerns such as securing health jobs and the economy rather than the planet so far the latter approach seems to be winning5 rather than boosting green investment in the past ten weeks the united states mexico south africa and other nations have relaxed laws controlling pollution and standards for vehicle energy efficiency the us rollback on fuel economy rules finalized in march will commit the nation to higher transport emissions — now the largest source of warming gases in the united states — for a decade or more thats worrisome because carbon dioxide lingers in the atmosphere for more than a century the longterm trajectory of emissions over many years determines how much co stock accumulates a brief lull is instructive but we must urgently build on it to limit longterm warming in this crisis any climatemitigation plan must deliver on the publics immediate needs or it will not fly luckily there are sweet spots that can deliver and save hundreds of thousands of jobs6 — such as investing in renewables and energy efficiency and preserving the existing fleet of zeroemission nuclear power plants climate activists and analysts recognize that massive government spending can be channelled to their favoured causes as happened in the economic stimulus after the financial crisis of 20087 what they have not grasped is just how severely the politics have shifted — away from longterm aspirations such as protecting the climate for the decades ahead and towards restoring jobs and wealth right now without political realism this opportunity for green recovery will be squandered in terms of scale the ongoing recession already exceeds any weve seen in modern times unemployment in the united states hard to measure because it is soaring so quickly was 16 last month and is still rising about onequarter of the us workforce didnt have jobs at the peak of the great depression in the 1930s history doesnt repeat itself but as many have said it often rhymes the world has experienced five major economic shocks since the first oil crisis which began in late one thousand nine hundred and seventythree see ‘shock and recovery four of these slowed the rise of emissions for example our analysis shows that during the recovery from the second oil crisis which began in 1979 emissions growth fell by onethird they went from 36 per year during 1976–79 to 24 per year during 1983–90 the next big recession was triggered by the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 it saw the trajectory flatten by another onethird to 16 per year during 1994–97 the one thousand nine hundred and ninetyeight asian financial crisis was the exception after a short recession emissions growth doubled during a decade of rapid industrial expansion this was the period of the phenomenal rise of china which promoted heavy manufacturing and exports all fuelled by coal historys rhythm skipped as the global economic order shifted it returned with the next shock after the global financial crash of 2008 emissions growth halved to 16 per year over the next decade indeed the past decade has seen the longest period of flattened emissions since the second world war this era coincided with sustained economic growth it is politically easier for governments to focus on longterm goals such as climate change as many governments did when economies are expanding furthermore up to 15 of the global stimulus funding injected after the two thousand and eight financial crisis went into developing and deploying green technologies7 how the coronavirus pandemic slashed carbon emissions — in five graphs the united states invested in smart meters and

precursors possibly through illicit smuggling the chair of the security council committee pursuant to resolution seven hundred and fiftyone 1992 concerning somalia said during a nine june videoconference meeting updating the council on the committees work from twentyeight february to nine june the representative of belgium speaking in his capacity as its chair noted that its members met twice in the “informal informals” format via closed videoconference during an informal discussion on twentynine april he said the united nations mine action service delivered a briefing on improvised explosive device trends in somalia with recommendations on the implementation of the newly imposed components ban on alshabaabs increased use of homemade explosives since 2018 the mine action service views that the effort to clear mines and unexploded war remnants across somalia has reduced alshabaabs access to military grade explosives apparently triggering a shift away from such explosives he said the mine action service encourages the development of a coordinated approach to controlling the supply of improvised explosive device components via regional bodies and agreements as well as donor support for strengthening the somali national army it also recommends continued sensitization of member states regarding their obligations under the sanctions regime on that point the committee had tasked the panel of experts with preparing a draft implementation assistance notice to guide member states on carrying out the improvised device component ban during an informal discussion on twentyseven may he said the coordinator of the panel of experts delivered a midterm update and submitted two monthly updates four areas of the midterm update were highlighted the reset in relations with the federal government of somalia the threat posed by alshabaab — notably the groups financial flows — the ban on the export of charcoal from somalia and the potential consequences of the covid19 pandemic all committee members welcomed the resumed cooperation and collaboration between the federal government and the panel and looked forward to the return of all panel members to somalia once the coronavirus travel restrictions were lifted he said the committee is now considering the six recommendations contained in the midterm update which broadly pertain to threats to peace and security in somalia particularly alshabaabs military and financial capabilities implementation of the arms embargo through improvement in weapons and ammunition management and international humanitarian law issues including strengthening the protection of civilians on other matters he said the committee dispatched a reply to a letter received from a member state on confidentiality issues it also received another letter with reference to the work of the predecessor of the panel of experts — the somalia and eritrea monitoring group — which it is currently considering he then summarized statistics pertaining to arms embargo exemption requests and notifications explaining that the committee approved an exemption request pursuant to paragraphs ten and thirteen of resolution two thousand four hundred and ninetyeight 2019 submitted by the federal government of somalia the committee received six advance delivery notifications pursuant to paragraphs eleven and thirteen of the same resolution from the federal government of somalia as well as an advance delivery notification from the supplying member state pursuant to paragraphs eleven and fourteen of the resolution in addition it received two postdelivery notifications pursuant to paragraph sixteen of the resolution submitted by the federal government and an advance delivery notification from a supplying member state in accordance with paragraph seventeen of the resolution he went on to say that following the resignation of a member of the panel of experts owing to personal and professional considerations a new expert was appointed by the secretarygeneral on twentynine may 2020 the representative of somalia welcomed the committees commitment to the ideals of confidentiality and accountability stressing that the government has taken important initial steps to reestablish relations with the panel of experts but to fully restore trust and confidence efforts to resolve pending matters — including those that somalia has repeatedly raised with the committee chair — are necessary “we are looking forward to your proposed course of action to be undertaken by the panel of experts as described in your

real estate agents adapting as they feel the impact of covid19|since the first case of covid19 was found in new zealand on 28th february we have all had to change our way of life these wellington images and video portray some of that journey real estate agents are adopting new strategies to survive the lockdown and do business in the transformed economic landscape writes rakesh krishnan not surprisingly the lack of ability to conduct business face to face during the lockdown has caused major disruption in the way people function in this sector with people generally insecure about their jobs or maybe even having lost their jobs many potential home buyers are – at least for the short term – reluctant to plonk down their cash on a bigticket purchase consequently many real estate agents have adopted innovative strategies to cope during these unprecedented times read more  sports bra exporter waiting for uplift in sales as global freight costs triple  wellington business confidence in the doldrums new survey findings show  southland interior designer diversifies to save her business  answers to common questions about the small business cashflow loan scheme some of the agents prosper talked to said the first few days of the lockdown felt really strange and it took a bit of getting used to but after a week or so a new normal emerged there was a realisation that you had to make the best of a dicey situation green baybased vicky ingham of ray white had a new listing ready to go live in the week of the lockdown but after discussion with the vendor she held it over until level 3 i made myself available to buyers and sellers who needed advice over the lockdown period but took care not to contact people who may have been under stress during that time she said the new normal in real estate is that if you cant hit the bricks go online ingham points out that some of her colleagues were able to secure contracts over the lockdown which included a clause subject to the purchaser viewing in level 3 this worked well for buyers who loved the look of a home online with the option of being able to view at a later date before declaring a contract unconditional she said ingham who has been in the industry for close to a decade points out that many aspects of real estate work can be effectively managed online flexisign is a product which allows for signing of contracts online virtual tours are now offered by most real estate photographers and online auctions are being further developed so whats in store for aucklands real estate industry contactless online marketing will become more dominant than ever and being up to speed with product development will be vital ingham said going forward technology will just get better and while it allows us to do a high quality job everything in the short term will run at a slower pace to enable us to keep buyers and vendors and their properties safe robbie bhullar and vish bhati of barfoot  thompson agree technology is rapidly transforming the real estate industry until recently the two west auckland agents were selling a property every 474 days so the covid19 pandemic has been especially hard on them however being early adopters of technology helped them mitigate some of the aftereffects of the slowdown even as trading remained restricted during the lockdown we were able to do digital negotiation and contactless transactions with existing customers they said electronic platforms such as docusign trello and crm systems made things easy during the lockdown south aucklandbased heather obern and kevin arthur of ray white manukau observe online marketing and communication has already become the primary medium of selling in the industry during the lockdown it was our window on the world they said properties can and are being sold without physical viewing especially for investment but most home buyers still want to view the home and see what it feels like enhanced digital viewings will help people decide whether they really want a physical viewing according to heather and kevin offmarket listings are becoming a significant segment of the market and may be more appealing in the postcovid marketplace these are listed properties that are not widely advertised but available through an agent this gives tighter control around viewing more vendor privacy and better qualified buyers we also think more salespeople will work away from their offices using virtual communications and online meetings at times offices may shrink in size as a result clearly the real estate landscape has changed and not everyone will come unscathed through the current crisis the industry is based on commissiononly income so agents without a reservoir of experience or in offices that arent professional or using new strategies will struggle – they will be outclassed by savvy competitors agents believe the removal of the loantovalue restrictions lvr attractive low interest rates and a lower median price should bring in more firsttime buyers giving the market a boost while this may not be the best time to be a real estate agent those with skin in the game are putting up a brave front perhaps theres no

what happens when facts face personal political and commercial pressures a book on the workings of science explores|the matter of facts skepticism persuasion and evidence in science gareth leng and rhodri ivor leng mit press 2020 the pandemic is an existential moment for the use and abuse of knowledge witness anthony fauci director of the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and the quintessence of scientific expertise having to keep his cool in regular televised press briefings alongside us president donald trump the personification of factfree politics the coronavirus is forcing rapid changes in research prioritization funding evaluation dissemination and communication this unprecedented situation makes the matter of facts penned prepandemic timelier than ever written by father and son gareth and rhodri leng it is a fascinating interdisciplinary exploration of how scientists produce and use evidence the covid19 crisis underscores their core message that science is a mostly productive cycle of rigorous scrutiny by experts not a rational progression towards immutable facts what is established one day is reconsidered the next — as anyone outside academia can now observe in real time science is powered by uncertainties error margins competition disclaimers collaboration and stress in dark times all of that can be weaponized gareth an experimental physiologist and rhodri a researcher in science technology and innovation studies bring together insights from a range of fields that analyse the workings of science they explore from a philosophical perspective how scientists weigh forms of evidence they use scientific studies to understand why researchers lack incentives to replicate findings and they turn a scientometric lens on features of the literature such as public bias selection bias and confirmation bias drawing on — mostly male — theorists including karl popper thomas kuhn and bruno latour the lengs show that far from being engaged in a disinterested activity scientists are in the business of persuasion they write narratives to convince colleagues of their claims or to overthrow conventional wisdom evidence becomes a rhetorical device scientists might torture their data to say the right things fail to mention evidence that contradicts their claims or add circuitous arguments that spin their evidence put more positively evidence is credible only when embedded in a persuasive story it does not speak for itself the authors dive into one of gareth lengs research interests — the hormone oxytocin — to lay bare the mechanisms of discovery in a delightful historical chapter they show how oxytocins perceived role shifted from chemical promoting quick birth to ‘love hormone of maternal care to ‘cuddle hormone of partner bonding to ‘trust hormone influencing social behaviour the substance first described by henry dale in one thousand nine hundred and six bears little resemblance to our current understanding all its roles are entwined with conventions and interpretation another section starts as a fairly composed description of the emergence of scientific journals it quickly turns into a passionate reproach to the commercialization of publishing and its disruptive effect on science corrupt journals and oligarchic publishers appear as villains and disparaging scientists as their victims the impact factor once an innocent tool for librarians is now a distorting measure that can make or break careers on the basis of purely anecdotal material the authors deconstruct how the culture of journal publishing is affecting science on the ground they describe a wellresearched phenomenon that i have elsewhere called “thinking with indicators” this is what happens when scientists design and adjust their research to ensure a good score or pick research questions to improve their chances of getting tenure it is problematic when other criteria of quality — originality longterm progress broader relevance — become ‘unthinkable the lengs correctly implicate the publishing industry but publishers are part of a complex web that also includes funders institutions evaluation systems and broader political and social structures this systems perspective is sometimes lacking in the matter of facts that aside the book spotlights major flaws in science including various forms of bias lack of transparency and rigour excessive competition commercialization and vanity publishing these predate covid19 the crisis has exacerbated some others have evaporated as scientists rush to solve lifeordeath problems this moment calls for a global collective vision of the structure of science it is unclear who will articulate such a vision the lengs help us to understand why the value ascribed

developers hope that tools for processing natural language will help biomedical researchers and clinicians to find the covid19 papers that they need|the covid19 literature has grown in much the same way as the diseases transmission exponentially the nihs covid19 portfolio a website that tracks papers related to the sarscov2 coronavirus and the disease it causes lists more than 28000 articles — far too many for any researcher to read see ‘explosive growth code and data at httpsgithubcomjperkelcovidlit but a fastgrowing set of artificialintelligence ai tools might help researchers and clinicians to quickly sift through the literature driven by a combination of factors — including the availability of a large collection of relevant papers advances in naturallanguage processing nlp technology and the urgency of the pandemic itself — these tools use ai to find the studies that are most relevant to the user and in some cases to extract specific findings from the results beyond the current pandemic such tools could help to bridge fields by making it easier to identify solutions from other disciplines says amalie trewartha one of the team leads for the literaturesearch tool covidscholar at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in berkeley california the tools are still in development and their utility is largely unproven they cant be used to make clinical or research decisions even using ai “a vaccine is not going to emerge fullblown” says oren etzioni chief executive of the allen institute for ai ai2 in seattle but developers hope the new technology will help researchers to focus their efforts “augmented intelligence is the best summary of ai” etzioni says the impetus for many of these efforts was a sixteen march ‘call to action in which the white house office of science and technology policy invited the ai community to develop tools for mining the covid19 literature to get them started the white house worked with several organizations to release the covid19 open research dataset cord19 a collection of 13000 fulltext papers on sarscov2 and other coronaviruses ai2 formatted the files for easier parsing by algorithms and adds new papers regularly the collection now numbers some 68000 papers and 67000 abstracts dozens of tools have emerged as a result “the cord19 data set is inadvertently proving to be a superinteresting pragmatic test” for aibased literature analysis says anthony goldbloom chief executive of the website kaggle a google subsidiary in san francisco california that hosts machinelearning competitions to focus ai researchers efforts the white house generated a set of questions to answer such as ‘what is known about adaptations mutations of the virus kaggle presents these questions — there are dozens — to its users and awards a weekly us1000 prize to the team that has the best answers medicalstudent volunteers sort through the results and compile the best answers into a set of tables on a central page which now acts as a continuously updated reference more than 1000 accounts have submitted algorithms josé morey the chief medicalinnovation officer at liberty biosecurity a research firm in arlington virginia used the resulting reference lists to draft in a matter of days a notyetpublished review article summarizing risk factors for covid19 severity “this would have taken me weeks of time to research on my own and aggregate” he says competitors typically use one of two ai methods says goldbloom the first is an “oldschool informationretrieval method” that requires explicit rules that look for specific keywords in papers and analyse the text around them the second uses deep neural networks a type of machinelearning method trained on large data sets to recognize text related to a question or topic the second phase of the competition which runs until sixteen june seeks to automate the process of compiling outputs from these ai searches and filling in tables summarizing what the literature reports about facets of covid19 such as risk factors and therapeutics a fastgrowing collection of tools exists outside the kaggle competitions googles covid19 research explorer for instance allows users to ask such questions as ‘what are the rapid molecular diagnostics for covid19 the tool returns a list of papers with key passages highlighted according to keith hall a computer scientist who leads the project from new york city the covid19 research explorer was already in the works as a biomedicalresearch tool before the pandemic when cord19 came out “it made it a little more obvious that we could provide a tool that might be helpful to researchers even if its not fully integrated with other google products” covidscholar developed at lawrence berkeley offers a simple search box for combing through the covid19 literature the results page however uses ai to tag papers with keywords and topic labels and offers filters — by attributes such as topic year peerreview status and source many papers in its corpus come from cord19 but the team developed its own scraping tools to collect documents from other sites as well says trewartha oscar whitney a biology doctoral student at the university of california berkeley used covidscholar while writing a paper on nucleicacid testing for covid19 the tool helped him to refine his searches better than google scholar and pubmed could he says — and it turned up papers he might not otherwise have found “this is definitely the best literaturesearch tool ive ever used” he says a search tool from ai2 called spikecord focuses not only on retrieval of papers but on extraction of information from them using a simple query language a search for ‘incubation period … from to to days returns a list of snippets such as ‘the incubation period ranges from three to twentyeight days with a click users can download those results to a spreadsheet with the low and high values in separate columns usually “writing these kinds of queries over large text basically requires you to sit down and write some code” says yoav goldberg who directs research at ai2 israel spikecord he says aims to expose the power of nlp to those who cannot program other tools enable more openended exploration for instance scisight developed by ai2 in collaboration with the university of washington in seattle blends four tools the ‘faceted search tool generates a changing list of papers as the user refocuses the search by selecting facets from eight categories including intervention for example vaccine outcome such as antibody response author and journal a ‘network of science tool shows which researchers are studying and collaborating on which aspects of the disease and other tools demonstrate connections between diseases and medicines and between genes and proteins all the tools are visual and interactive such that clicking on one variable presents further connections the platform supports “this kind of iterative refinement” says tom hope who leads the scisight project in seattle “which is useful when you dont really know what it is that you dont know — the ‘unknown unknowns” sravanthi parasa a gastroenterologist and clinical researcher at the swedish medical center in seattle calls the scisight disease–drug network search tool “a brilliant idea” she envisions using it outside the pandemic with patients who sometimes ask about uncommon drug interactions doctors dont normally see parasa typically answers these using pubmed but that “takes 10–15 minutes even at lightning speed” knetminer for covid19 from rothamsted research a nonprofit organization in harpenden uk sifts through the text of papers as well as data on genetic linkages protein–protein interactions and gene expression to build a knowledge network of papers genes drugs diseases and proteins joseph hearnshaw a bioinformatics scientist at rothamsted is using the tool to understand why covid19 kills more men than women by looking for connections between the disease hormones and certain genes — a process of interactive exploration he says “within minutes i can generate new hypotheses and share the networks with clinicians” and covid19 primer supplements the covid19 literature with other data sources including news outlets and twitter the site tracks the mostdiscussed papers top emerging topics and trending quotes from news sources including national public radio and foxnewscom using neural networks and oldschool information retrieval it also constructs reading lists both overall and in eleven research categories the anticipated user is the “general scientifically literate citizen someone who wants to know whats the state of play” says john bohannon the director of science at primer a san franciscobased company that develops ai technology a little unexpectedly the site has drawn frontline researchers including madeline grade an emergencymedicine physician and researcher at the university of california san francisco grade found covid19 primer especially helpful early in the pandemic when “every aspect of care was changing on a daily basis” she was inundated with information and needed to create daily protocol updates for the universitys hospital “amid that chaos” she says “the primer app was actually a really amazing way to cut through the noise” so far these sites have received modest traffic as of late may covid19 primer has welcomed 14000 unique visitors per month and scisight has seen 11000 since it launched covidscholar receives about five hundred visitors each day and covid19 knetminer has had that many in total the kaggle challenge has received the most attention with 17 million page views since it launched in midmarch of the covid19 researchers we contacted most had not heard of the majority of these tools and still more such tools are being developed around the world including vilokana in india and covidask in south korea to be

the european central bank ecb is the central bank of the nineteen european union countries which have adopted the euro our main task is to maintain price stability in the euro area and so preserve the purchasing power of the single currency|interview on twitter with isabel schnabel member of the executive board of the ecb conducted and published on nine june two thousand and twenty good afternoon this is  executive board member  im here to answer your questions for the next fortyfive minutes please use to join the conversation why do you continue to use and expand qe given that it has been a massive contributer to wealth inequality over the past decade schnabel empirical evidence does not support this statement qe has even slightly reduced wealth inequality in the euro area see httpswwwecbeuropaeupubpdfscpwpsecbwp2190enpdf if your inflation goal overshoots and we have a inflation of about 3 or more will you increase interest rates and stop qe what would be the consequences for italy and indebted companies schnabel we counter too high as well as too low inflation in a symmetric way by focusing on the medium term we can adjust the speed of returning to our inflation aim thereby mitigating the side effects of our measures including on member states firms and households  why is the holding so much gold schnabel the eurosystem currently holds around 9 of its balance sheet in the form of gold and gold receivables httpswwwecbeuropaeupressprwfs2020htmlecbfst200602enhtml gold is an important foreign reserve asset that is held for liquidity and risk diversification purposes do purchase programmes especially those that essentially target spreads like the pspp envelope or pepp delay or prevent economic reforms in member states especially in low growthhigh debt states if not why schnabel there is no evidence that our purchase programmes have delayed economic reforms in the covid19 crisis fiscal  monetary policy are complementary our policies support reform efforts through their beneficial effect on funding costs why are you allowing zombie companies to survive  they are not productive and suppress long term growth arent they schnabel our policies primarily support healthy and promising firms the share of unviable firms has declined in many countries bank health matters more for firm quality than monetary policy see httpswwwecbeuropaeupubpdfscpwpsecbwp224061e2d9dfecenpdf could you discuss whether changes to the dual rate system of tltros  deposit tiering could become the primary policy tool while the deposit facility rate remains negative schnabel the negative deposit facility rate lowers funding costs for the whole economy offering more attractive conditions in tltros is an effective way to foster bank lending to households and firms the tiering system reduces side effects on bank profitability christine lagarde talked about being ahead of the curve with stable coins can you expand on what that means and looks like in practice schnabel we proactively monitor current developments in the area of stablecoins assessing regulatory and financial stability implications httpswwwecbeuropaeupubfinancialstabilitymacroprudentialbulletinhtmlecbmpbu20200513e9ac10eb1enhtml at the same time we are open to innovation including in the area of digital currencies are you discussing measures to enable deep neative rates at the board eg the suggestion of agarwalkimball and what is your view on deep negativ rates as an alternative to qe schnabel currently we consider asset purchases to be a more effective and efficient tool also taking potential side effects into account but our experience with negative interest rates has been positive and lowering interest rates remains an option for the future what kind of data would make you reconsider the fact that qe actually boosts inflation instead of the opposite schnabel this question has to be analysed by comparing actual inflation with a counterfactual situation without qe based on empirical data our analyses show that the effect of qe on inflation has been positive see httpswwwecbeuropaeupubpdfscpwpsecbwp2346dd78042370enpdf “power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely” how is the ecbs power limited  and by whom i assume we can agree that the soft reporting requirements towards the eu parliament do not suffice as answer thank you schnabel we have a clear mandate – price stability – which is laid down in the treaties we are subject to the jurisdiction of the european court of justice and dont underestimate our accountability towards the european parliament which is actually quite important everyone knows that most of the money is not coming to the consumers instead the biggest part end up at the markets where the bubbles are growing even bigger so is there a real plan to do something for the economy or are all your actions only for making the rich even richer  schnabel i beg to differ our measures have been beneficial for consumers as they contributed to higher wages and created jobs income inequality has even decreased as poorer households have benefited more from the positive employment effects how are you ever going to normalise or will you just keep digging deeper and deeper until it all comes crashing down schnabel our monetary policy actions are guided by our price stability mandate we will adjust our measures when mediumterm inflation recovers in a sustainable way always taking into account the risks to financial stability and other potential side effects why ecb uses debt financing instead of monetary financing for covid recovery article 1231of tfeu can be temporarily suspended to allow monetary financing and to avoid austerity in the future it is not possible to repay debts because the money to pay interests is never issued schnabel the prohibition of monetary financing is a cornerstone of our monetary system that ensures monetary stability the ecbs policies support economic growth and employment by providing favourable funding conditions throughout the euro area dear  as the assessed the climate impact of its response and operations in general what are the plans to integrate climate before and during the strategic review unfortunately time is at the essence… schnabel climate protection is a key topic in our monetary policy strategy review which will be resumed shortly we will analyse the role of climate change for our economic models investment portfolios risk assessments and monetary policy operations hi we had a for you the other day about the exact guidance given to ncbs by the ecb executive board for the asset purchases in term of maturity etc thanks schnabel in national central banks receive guidance about the amounts to be purchased guided by the capital key but with flexibility with respect to maturities purchases are guided by market neutrality therefore they also depend on issuance behaviour during the covid crisis the ecb has allowed banks to use their own internal rating models for certain assets in order to obtain liquidity from the ecb dont you think its against governance that customers mark the quality of their own assets for external purposes schnabel internal models are a wellaccepted tool in banking supervision to mitigate incentive problems supervisors carefully check these models the acceptance of internal ratings is a temporary measure to relieve the strains from the covid19 pandemic why is inflation so important to you schnabel what is important to me is price stability both too high and too low inflation can lead to high costs for society thats why we are mandated by the treaty to keep prices stable in recent years inflation has been too low and is projected to fall even further how long before cash is banned to enable interest rates to go deep into negative schnabel cash continues to be very popular in the euro area with some differences across member states we are always ready to explore innovations like digital currencies but there is no intention to abandon cash how do you think about national accs which lead to a renationalisation of monetary policy might be used as an instrument of national economic policy to ease bankss lcr fulfillment and hence might lead to a race to the bottom in collateral acceptance schnabel the expansion of the acc framework is a temporary response to the pandemic which allows banks to make full use of our liquidity operations so they can continue lending to the real economy see our recent blog post on collateral httpswwwecbeuropaeupressblogdate2020htmlecbblog200422244d933f86enhtml what is your view about the possibility of the monetary policy regime adjustment towards the historydependent regimes ie plt ait etc or what do you see as the biggest challenges for such a change schnabel the advantages and disadvantages of price level targeting and average inflation targeting are going to be considered in the context of our monetary policy strategy review as president lagarde said “we will not leave any stone unturned” is there a limit to which the ecbs asset purchases can deviate from the capital key if so what is it thank you schnabel our public sector asset purchases are guided by the capital key our pandemic emergency purchase programme pepp offers the flexibility to deviate from the capital key as required to ensure a smooth transmission of our monetary policy to the entire euro area what methods does the ecb employ to ensure intellectual diversity in monetary thinking schnabel our staff is intellectually and culturally diverse and we encourage open discussions within the institution broad external interaction with economists with diverse backgrounds ensures full exposure to different streams of monetary thinking what would you consider as a success in terms of tltroiii takeup next week schnabel given the favourable pricing we expect a sizeable takeup next week allotment on thursday eighteen june the tltros are successful if banks use the|2020-06-09|0.999|positive|0.11461847357832755|positive

daily data on google searches for ninetyfive countries this column demonstrates that the covid19 crisis has increased google searches for prayer relative to all google searches to the highest level ever recorded by the end of march 2020 more than half of the world population had prayed to ‘end the coronavirus prayer searches rose at all levels of income inequality and insecurity but not for the 10 least religious countries the covid19 pandemic has brought sizeable costs for societies across the globe a pandemic of this size potentially changes our societies for years to come especially if it impacts our ingrained values and beliefs it may have impacted values such as populism nationalism morelli 2020 baldwin and weder di mauro 2020 and economic anxiety fetzer et al 2020 in a new paper bentzen 2020 i document the manner in which the covid19 crisis has influenced one of the most deeply rooted human behaviours religion people pray in order to cope with uncertainty and adversity this rising religiosity may have implications for the economy in various ways first a large part of the economic downturn in the face of covid19 is due to economic anxiety andersen et al 2020 fetzer et al 2020 if religion dampens anxiety religious societies may experience smaller reductions in consumption it is evident that religion worked as such a buffer during previous large macroeconomic downturns caused by the spanish flu and wwi bentzen and dalgaard 2020 second covid19 may increase religiosity permanently which in turn could impact the wider economy likewise it should be noted that earthquakes increase religiosity permanently across generations bentzen 2019 previous research has documented a multitude of correlations between religiosity and socioeconomic factors from peoples ability to cope with stress and uncertainty to reductions in criminal behavior guiso et al 2003 miller et al 2014 to lower gdp growth and more traditional gender roles mccleary and barro 2006 inglehart and norris 2003 third rising ‘prayer intensity reveals that people from across the globe experience emotional distress in the face of the covid19 pandemic and they use religion in order to cope the economic consequences of these emotional effects may be large andersen et al 2020 with the main part of the economic downturn being due to the perceived risk of the virus rather than government mandated lockdowns in my recent paper i identify empirically the extent to which the covid19 pandemic has induced people across the globe to pray whether the phenomenon is global and who prays in times of crisis google searches for religious terms as a share of all google searches provides a signal of peoples interest in religion in real time various research suggests that our behaviour on the internet reflects our personal interests and the actions we take in the real world moat et al 2016 olivola et al 2019 ginsberg et al 2009 likewise whether or not we search for religious terms on the internet reflects our religious preferences yeung 2019 stephensdavidowich 2015 the main analysis focuses on searches for the topic ‘prayer including all topics related to prayer in all languages searches for other religious terms also rise such as god allah muhammad quran bible and jesus and to a lesser extent searches for buddha vishnu and shiva the latter two being hindu gods events that instigate intensified prayer are clearly visible in the data before the covid19 pandemic ramadan contributed to the largest yearly increase in the global search intensity for prayer panel a of figure 1 also prayer search shares spike upwards on sundays everywhere searches for prayer surged in iran on seven january 2020 coinciding with the funeral of qassem soleimani the iranian major general killed by us troops similar spikes were seen in australia on five january 2020 when the movement prayer for australia swept across the world in the midst of the unprecedented bushfires and in albania on twentysix november two thousand and nineteen when the country was hit by a 64 magnitude earthquake in march 2020 the share of google searches for prayer surged to the highest level ever recorded surpassing all other major events that otherwise call for prayer such as christmas easter and ramadan figure 1 the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic on eleven march 2020 the level of prayer search shares in march two thousand and twenty was more than 50 higher than the average during february 2020 for comparison the surge in google searches for prayer was 13 times larger than the rise in searches for takeaways and amounted to 12 of the rise in netflix searches or 26 of the fall in searches for flights which all saw massive changes globally since most countries were in lockdown and air traffic was shut down figure one worldwide google searches for “prayer” during the past four years notes google searches for prayer relative to the total number of google searches the maximum shares were set to 100 the searches encompass all topics related to prayer including alternative spellings and languages the vertical stippled lines in panel a represent the first week of the ramadan the period in panel a is the longest period for which comparable data was available at the time of writing the period in panel b is the period used in the main analysis starting before covid19 became a pandemic and ending before the onset of easter and the ramadan google search results for ‘prayer usually provide prayer texts to use when praying prayers may be recited from memory or read from a book in modern times these books or verses of prayer can be found on the internet one of the most searched for prayer categories in march two thousand and twenty was coronavirus prayer which are prayers that ask god for protection against the coronavirus prayers to stay strong and prayers to thank nurses for their efforts according to a recent pew research center survey more than half of americans had prayed to end the coronavirus pew 2020b using daily data on google searches for prayer for ninetyfive countries across the globe i find that the rise visible in figure one occurs around eleven march two thousand and twenty for most countries and increasingly so after their own populations had been infected the rise in prayer is a global phenomenon with all countries except the 10 least religious seeing significant rises in prayer search shares figure two illustrates which countries saw the largest rise in searches for prayer indicated by darker shades of green regionally the largest increases occur in south america africa and indonesia some of the most religious areas of the world in general the more religious societies searched more for prayer on the internet prayer searches rose for all major religious denominations but only significantly for christians and muslims the rise was more modest for hindus and buddhists figure two the rise in prayer search shares across the globe in march two thousand and twenty notes darker green indicates larger rises in prayer search shares missing data is indicated with grey prayer search shares rose more in poorer more insecure and more unequal countries however this impact is exclusively due to these countries being more religious this indicates that the availability of religion may be more important for its use in coping rather than the potential need for religion using these results and the pew 2020b survey documenting that more than half of the americans had prayed to end the coronavirus a back of the envelope calculation shows that more than half of the global population had prayed to end the coronavirus by the end of march 2020 the main reason for the rising interest in prayer on the internet is religious coping where people use their religion to cope with adversity pargament 2001 they pray for relief understanding and comfort research has documented that people struggling with cancer death within their close family or severe illness are more religious recent research shows that adversity in the form of natural disasters causes people to use their religion more intensively bentzen 2019 sibley and bulbulia 2012 people may use google to search for prayer for a reason unrelated to religious coping they may be searching for online forums to replace their physical churches that closed down in an attempt to enforce social distancing theoretically we would not expect this to be the main explanation for the rising search shares for prayer people tend to use mainly their intrinsic religiosity such as private prayer rather than their extrinsic religiosity such as churchgoing to cope with adversity pargament two thousand and one and bentzen 2019 in addition a recent survey reveals that 95 of americans who pray pray alone while only 2 pray collectively in a church barna 2017 thus even if the churches had been open we would expect prayer to rise more than churchgoing another survey shows that 24 of americans respond that their faith has strengthened since the onset of the coronavirus crisis which we would not have predicted if people were simply replacing their physical churchgoing with online church pew 2020a they must be doing something that strengthens their faith the empirical results support the claim that replacement of physical

today|following are un secretarygeneral antónio guterres remarks as prepared for delivery to the extraordinary meeting of the global investors for sustainable development alliance in new york today thank you for joining this virtual meeting i appreciate your engagement with the united nations during these extraordinary times as the world faces the covid19 pandemic you are some of the business communitys most important voices and the world needs your leadership for an effective response and a sustainable and inclusive recovery i also thank the partner agencies and organizations that form the global investors for sustainable development secretariat for their support the diverse and severe impacts of the pandemic continue to unfold unemployment has skyrocketed temporary business closures are becoming permanent rebuilding to precrisis levels of employment and output may take years this unparalleled economic shock places development gains at risk and throws us even more off track in our efforts to achieve the sustainable development goals and as ever the poorest and most vulnerable suffer most — from job losses and illness from overwhelmed and insufficient health systems and a lack of social safety nets while the immediate response is critical in limiting devastation from the disease and cushioning the socioeconomic impacts a long and difficult path lies before us as communities determine how to reopen businesses relax social distancing restrictions and enable free movement of people within and across borders while keeping the public health crisis at bay yet with crisis comes opportunity with the worlds fragilities and inequalities so painfully exposed it is clear that we cannot simply rebuild the world as it was rather we must build a fairer greener and more resilient global economy that leaves no one behind there are positive signs that this moment could provide the opening for transformations that have been long in the making but perhaps needed a push covid19 is having dramatic impacts on the way the world works – for example by reducing energy usage and prompting the adoption of technologies that can decouple the economy from its reliance on fossil fuels these changes can be the beginning of the process of shaping our world for the better but the global community must go further taking active steps to align recovery with sustainable development the two thousand and thirty agenda is the worlds agreed framework the addis ababa action agenda provides a path for mobilizing resources and the paris agreement on climate change is the tool that can get us to net‑zero carbon emissions by two thousand and fifty and limit the global temperature rise to 15°c one key challenge is to better align economic value with social value this means businesses acting in the interest of stakeholders not just shareholders and integrating sustainability into their operations with the pandemic this message now has new poignancy we must use this opportunity to accelerate the shift of public international finance towards sustainable sectors and to align private financial flows with the achievement of net‑zero emissions both can bring major capital flows to developing and emerging economies countering the forces of fragmentation that this crisis threatens to unleash this is the objective of special envoy mark carney to ensure that every financial decision takes account of environmental and social impacts this is more important than ever in the coming months as companies investors and countries make big financial decisions about the future i encourage you to support and implement his calls to action around three key areas reporting risk and return that means reporting in line with the task force on climaterelated financial disclosures and supporting calls to make this reporting mandatory it means looking at the impact of climate risks on business models by using the scenario analysis that mark is helping to develop and finally it means transition plans to reach net‑zero emissions from companies in which you invest marks work will help you assess the credibility of these plans and make investment decisions accordingly we can use the two thousand and twentyone united nations climate change conference and the decade of action for the sustainable development goals to put in place the right market and regulatory frameworks so that the private sector can efficiently allocate capital — to manage the risks but also to seize the opportunities across all economies resources and investments will be critical in pursuing this new path for the past several months the global investors for sustainable development alliance has worked to arrive at a common understanding on how to incentivize greater investment in sustainable development how to channel those investments to areas and economies with the most need and how to ensure investments have the desired impact this work has set the stage for the next step — implementing solutions at sufficient scale covid19 has derailed many plans it has shifted the focus away from long‑term planning to immediate needs but this crisis underscores the need to think long term build resilience and limit the impact of future crises in particular the impacts of climate change will not wait we are already seeing the effects of climate change globally in the increased frequency and severity of weatherrelated disasters without swift and decisive action we can expect such crises to multiply crises in general will become even more multilayered and complex stretching already limited resources and causing more widespread human suffering i call on you to seize this moment of crisis to shape our future for the better thank you again for joining us today

more to help bring darfur war crimes suspects to justice during a ten june videoconference meeting that took place a day after the surrender of a key fugitive fatou bensouda said that ali kushaybs transfer to international criminal court custody in the central african republic on three june is a pivotal development that sends a clear signal that no matter how long it takes or what obstacles might be put in the way her office will not stop until alleged perpetrators of rome statute crimes are brought to justice “all icc international criminal court suspects against whom arrest warrants have been issued must face justice” she said adding that her team in the hague is keeping up its work to a notable degree despite the challenges posed by the covid19 pandemic she expressed optimism that the ongoing transitional process in sudan — and peace talks in juba between the government and armed movements — augurs well for prospects to achieve justice for darfur victims she added that she remains hopeful that a new chapter of constructive engagement between the court and sudan rooted in mutual respect and a genuine commitment to justice may be on the horizon securing justice for past crimes in darfur must remain a priority for the government as it steers sudan towards greater human security and prosperity international criminal court arrest warrants for four other suspects remain in force she said including those issued against former president omar albashir who is currently serving a twoyear sentence in sudan following a domestic trial on financial corruption charges two others — ahmad harun and abdel raheem hussein — are reportedly still in government custody awaiting charges she said expressing concern over reports that they have fallen ill with the coronavirus another suspect abdallah banda remains at large the council acting under chapter vii of the united nations referred the situation prevailing in darfur since one july two thousand and two to the international criminal court through resolution one thousand five hundred and ninetythree 2005 the organization estimates that around 300000 were killed and around 27 million forced from their homes during the conflict that involved government forces allied militia and armed movements presenting the international criminal courts thirtyfirst report to the council on the situation in darfur the prosecutor said that while sudan is not a party to the rome statute that established the court it must — pursuant to resolution one thousand five hundred and ninetythree 2005 and subsequent orders from the courts judges — surrender all individuals subject to the courts arrest warrants she acknowledged that khartoum is dealing with complex challenges and competing priorities but emphasized that meeting the sudanese peoples legitimate demands for justice and accountability must remain at the forefront underscoring the importance of cooperation and for court personnel to access sudanese territory she called on council members states parties to the rome statute and the international community more broadly to encourage the government to work with her office fully and promptly “justice for darfur has already been too elusive for too long” she said “it is past time for that unsatisfactory state of affairs to change a window of opportunity has been reopened we must collectively seize it let us act together to finally bring justice to the victims in darfur” in the ensuing discussion speakers recalled the councils decision on four june through resolutions two thousand five hundred and twentyfour 2020 and two thousand five hundred and twentyfive 2020 to establish the united nations integrated transition assistance mission in sudan unitams from one january two thousand and twentyone to assist sudan in its transition to democratic governance as the organization looks ahead to winding down the african unionunited nations hybrid operation in darfur unamid see press releases sc14202 and sc14203 of four june several delegates welcomed mr kushaybs surrender and recent positive developments in sudan and echoed the prosecutors call for khartoum to cooperate more closely and openly with the court others emphasized that the court must respect sudans sovereignty independence and territorial integrity the united kingdoms representative said that one year after the removal of a brutal regime sudan is at a historic moment part of its transition is the pursuit of accountability and transitional justice which must be delivered as soon as possible for the victims of darfur he recalled that the government of sudan stated in february its intention to try those indicted by the international criminal court for the crimes for which they have been charged however the united kingdom does not yet understand how khartoum will cooperate with the court it must engage swiftly with the court and the prosecutor he said adding that it should permit the prosecutor to visit sudan and the darfur region as soon as covid19 implications allow estonias representative said that mr kushaybs voluntary surrender into the courts custody is an important step in the pursuit of justice for crimes committed in darfur he called on khartoum to extend meaningful cooperation towards the court and ensure that every effort is made to prevent further violations on the ground he also called on all states to fully engage and cooperate with the court for the arrest and surrender to the hague of the four remaining suspects hopefully he added the events of nine june will mark the start of a new dialogue between sudans authorities and the court which is a prerequisite for any meaningful path to justice and accountability south africas representative welcomed statements by sudanese officials indicating a willingness to cooperate with the court as well as the surrender of mr kushayb to the court on nine june he likewise welcomed that sudanese authorities have raised the possibility of proceedings against suspects through the court or a hybrid court in khartoum he expressed concern over allegations of civilian casualties in darfur and incidents of sexual and genderbased violence reported by the panel of experts condemning these actions in the strongest terms he also deplored all attacks against aid workers and the looting of humanitarian supplies from local nongovernmental organizations echoing concerns about the protection of civilians he urged all stakeholders to engage in dialogue to restore peace and stability in sudan the representative of saint vincent and the grenadines welcomed efforts to bring about justice for victims in darfur and ongoing negotiations in juba as pivotal for restoring peace expressing concern over protracted security and humanitarian challenges he called for strengthening institutions to protect the most vulnerable and prosecuting the perpetrators of atrocity crimes he looked forward to the implementation of resolutions two thousand five hundred and twentyfour 2020 and two thousand five hundred and twentyfive 2020 in this regard noting that sudans judiciary is responsible for prosecuting atrocity crimes and that resolution one thousand five hundred and ninetythree 2005 encourages sudan to cooperate with the court in tackling impunity he reiterated the principle of complementarity in the application of international criminal law observing that the courts jurisdiction is only invoked when states are unable or unwilling to prosecute alleged perpetrators the dominican republics representative said that “this is the moment for the government of sudan to show that accountability is a priority for the authorities” he welcomed the possibility that international criminal court suspects could be tried in sudan as that could represent a perfect start to a cooperative and fruitful relationship between khartoum and the court he voiced concern about the complex and difficult situation in darfur condemned attacks on humanitarian workers in the region and called on the government to help stop sexual violence against women and girls “its time the sudanese people move forward towards a sustainable peace based on democratic principles of justice and accountability” he said belgiums representative strongly welcoming mr kushaybs surrender said that the court cannot implement its mandate effectively without the assistance of states he welcomed the fact that accountability for crimes in darfur remains a central issue in the peace talks in juba between the government and the armed movements and invited khartoum to reply positively to the prosecutors call for dialogue to facilitate fair and genuine proceedings against the four other darfur suspects either in the hague or in sudan he encouraged neighbouring states to help the office of the prosecutor to track down mr banda and urged united nations missions and agencies to strengthen their cooperation with the court “as attacks on civilians and humanitarian aid workers continue in darfur as well as violence against internally displaced persons and incidents of sexual and genderbased violence against women and girls we need justice more than ever” he said calling upon the council and member states to support the court and the sudanese authorities to end impunity in darfur in favour of a lasting peace viet nams representative taking note of the prosecutors report and briefing and welcoming positive developments in sudan emphasized that states bear the primary responsibility for the implementation of international humanitarian law and for the prevention and suppression of serious criminal acts especially genocide war crimes and crimes against humanity viet nam hopes that the government of sudan

canada has thousands of qualified doctors and nurses who could help our strained health system now and in the future – but theyre stuck on the sidelines|part of the rationale for such barriers is the critical importance of canadian experience and the need for medical professionals to meet canadian standards requirements for residency experience within canada are coupled with a limited number of spots which essentially forces many physicians to start over despite having potentially decades of experience under their belt even canadiantrained medical students can struggle to find placements but for internationally trained physicians it is even more difficult in 2019 the canadian residency matching service reported that out of 1758 international medical graduates 1360 were not matched with residency placements and even if internationally trained physicians receive a spot they are often underemployed and unsupported leading to financial and emotional hardship as foreign experts languish in the system the need for physicians continues to be great many institutions have noted canada falls behind the majority of oecd nations when it comes to physicians per capita according to the world bank canada has only 26 doctors for every 1000 residents italy which until recently was the epicentre of the pandemic has about fifty per cent more per capita the covid19 crisis has spurred some promising initiatives to leverage this untapped talent pool to address an immense need italy the united kingdom and some american states have eased the requirements for internationally educated physicians and novice medical graduates to contribute to national covid19 efforts for example in new jersey authorities have granted temporary licences to doctors residing in state with good standing in foreign countries in new york internationally trained medical graduates are now allowed to treat patients after one year of residency compared to the regular requirement of three years some medical licensing bodies in canada are taking similar steps for example in ontario international medical graduates who have passed their exams in canada can apply for a 30day medical licence the college of physicians and surgeons of british columbia has fasttracked a new bylaw to amend the provinces health professions act so international medical graduates can apply for a supervised associate physician licence allowing them to work under the supervision of attending physicians these efforts to lower barriers to entry show promise as a way to address the immediate health crisis but the pandemic also presents a crucial opportunity to leverage this globally educated talent pool over the long term the canadian population is aging and more health care is being delivered outside of hospitals so we will continue to need more health professionals in the community many canadians also find it challenging to find a physician who understands their mother tongue and cultural context internationally trained medical professionals can help plug those health equity gaps we need federal leadership during this crisis to ensure there is coordination across all jurisdictions to achieve clarity for internationally trained physicians canada should consider several options to achieve this • adopt the solution proposed by the ontario council of agencies serving immigrants toronto region immigrant employment council and world education services to recruit train and deploy internationally trained physicians to support our healthcare systems during this time of emergency • automatically grant physicians who have been provided a temporary licence during the pandemic the ability to practise to their full capacity afterwards • increase the number of residency spaces for internationally trained physicians • once this pandemic passes a federalprovincialterritorial working group should be established to examine the issue more deeply and build pancanadian consensus one of the first tasks assigned to this entity should be to create a simplified accreditation process across the country over the past number of years weve seen various orders of government academic institutions and selfgoverned medical professions work together to make some progress such as investing in bridging programs and placements for internationally trained physicians this is a helpful start but more needs to be done covid19 provides an opportunity to accelerate the many good program and policy ideas that have already been discussed or introduced in ways that are too limited now is the time to make real and lasting progress to help our healthcare system internationally trained medical professionals and canadians in need of health care this article was originally published by first policy response on may 1 2020|2020-06-10|0.9968|positive|0.10431941476245273|positive
the european central bank ecb is the central bank of the nineteen european union countries which have adopted the euro our main task is to maintain price stability in the euro area and so preserve the purchasing power of the single currency|the ecbs policy in the covid19 crisis – a mediumterm perspective remarks by isabel schnabel member of the executive board of the ecb at an online seminar hosted by the florence school of banking  finance over the past few weeks hopes for a short duration of the covid19 pandemic and a quick rebound in economic activity have started to fade evidence is increasingly pointing towards a protracted impact of the crisis on both demand and supply conditions in the euro area and beyond for central banks this implies a shift in focus from economic “firefighting” – ensuring orderly market functioning and a sufficient provision of liquidity – to dealing with the implications of the crisis on mediumterm inflation my remarks today will focus on these implications based on our most recent eurosystem staff projections i will first discuss the risk of covid19 leaving a deep footprint on growth and inflation in the euro area against this background i will then describe how we designed and calibrated our policy response and explain why the pandemic emergency purchase programme pepp remains the appropriate tool to address the current challenges of the crisis in the context of our price stability mandate the mediumterm economic impact of the crisis the immediate economic fallout from the covid19 pandemic has been substantial in the first quarter of 2020 euro area gdp declined by 36 in the baseline scenario of the eurosystem june staff projections output declines by a staggering 13 quarteronquarter in the second quarter as lockdown measures are being eased across euro area countries a cautious recovery in activity is currently taking place but adverse effects on household income and production can be expected to persist for a considerable period of time such protracted effects are clearly visible in the most recent eurosystem staff projections given the current exceptional degree of uncertainty these projections were organised around three scenarios that differ with respect to the severity of the economic fallout from the pandemic in the euro area see left chart on slide 2 all scenarios assume that the substantial support from monetary fiscal and labour market policies is sufficient to avert adverse financial amplification channels while the severity of the contraction differs substantially across scenarios none of the three trajectories is in line with a full recovery of real gdp by the end of two thousand and twentytwo to the levels projected by staff in march in the severe scenario our staff projections suggest that the level of real gdp at the end of two thousand and twentytwo could remain 96 below the march two thousand and twenty staff projection path in effect both the nature of the shock and the length of the ensuing downturn make it likely that the economy will experience important structural shifts disentangling the effects of these shifts on demand and supply and hence on mediumterm inflation is inherently difficult in the baseline scenario ecb staff projections predict notable downward pressure on inflation arising from the much larger shortfall in aggregate demand than supply as a result headline inflation is not anticipated to be back on its precovid19 path by two thousand and twentytwo in that scenario and underlying inflation is also expected to remain subdued in the medium term see right chart on slide 2 given the unprecedented impact of the crisis on income and consumption such disinflationary effects are not surprising but uncertainty around these forecasts is exceptionally large while measuring economic slack is already a challenge in normal times it is currently exacerbated by the highly uncertain effects of the crisis on potential output both in the short and in the medium to long run in the short run potential output is severely affected by disruptions in global value chains and social distancing measures which constrain the full use of capital think of the hairdresser who may only be able to use half of his or her physical capacity such effects may partly offset the negative effects of weakening demand on inflation even in the short run in the medium to long run the impact of the crisis on potential output and hence on inflation will crucially depend on the response of firms and policymakers to the challenges we are currently facing first some sectors of the economy may never return to their previous size requiring a large reallocation of capital and labour also across borders despite some progress in recent years however product and labour markets in the euro area still remain too rigid to accommodate the required shift in resources in a swift manner risking permanent damage to the economy households hit by job losses for example could be scarred in terms of income and human capital temporary layoffs and governmentfunded shorttime work schemes have so far successfully cushioned the impact of the crisis on euro area employment in fact the unemployment rate across the largest countries in the euro area would have been much higher in the absence of these programmes see slide 3 but uncertainty may weigh on investment and job creation for a long period and although furlough schemes can mitigate hysteresis effects in labour markets by reducing worker displacement they may also delay the necessary structural adjustments to the crisis second the speed and extent of capital and labour reallocation is likely to differ across euro area economies depending on the sectoral composition and the quality of labour market institutions such differences if left unaddressed risk increasing heterogeneity and fragmentation further complicating the conduct of the common monetary policy third recent events have increased the odds that large cashrich firms may absorb liquiditystrapped startups thereby curtailing competition with potentially adverse effects on productivity and welfare the pandemic could therefore amplify trends in economic concentration that we have already observed prior to the crisis particularly in the united states1 fourth there are risks that covid19 will lead to a surge in protectionism reversing the current pattern of international production while reshoring could be the outcome of benign advances in automation a general unwinding of global supply chains would jeopardise potential output growth across the globe and finally financial distress of firms and households will cause the share of banks nonperforming loans npls to rise over time weighing on bank capital and potentially clogging the bank lending channel of monetary policy although euro area banks as a whole have entered this crisis in comparatively good shape the experience of past crises highlights that vulnerabilities in the banking sector if not addressed early enough may severely slow the pace of recovery and leave longlasting damage recent ecb research for example suggests that a failure to resolve high levels of npls in a timely manner can slow gdp growth by 15 percentage points per year2 however the magnitude of all these effects is far from certain as is their impact on mediumterm inflation it will critically depend on the extent to which firms and policymakers will use this crisis as an opportunity to overcome weak potential output growth that has held back prosperity and convergence in the euro area for too long already the european recovery fund proposal is a promising step in the right direction by strengthening investment in new and sustainable technologies the euro area can accelerate its transition towards a digitalised and lowcarbon economy the covid19 crisis forcefully demonstrates that digital transformation is not an option but a must the mediumterm implications of covid19 for monetary policy when prospects for the economy and inflation are highly uncertain central banks essentially have to act as risk managers they need to take action before the risks materialise to shelter the economy from further and deeper harm tail risks in particular may cause the economy to react in a nonlinear and disruptive way in spite of the receding stress in financial markets there was therefore unanimous understanding at the june meeting of the ecbs governing council that further strong policy support was needed to prevent mediumterm inflation from moving further away from our inflation aim of below but close to 2 two broad decisions had to be taken the first was the choice of the appropriate instruments the second was the calibration of the instruments taking into account potential side effects these two decisions are of course interrelated the choice of instruments ultimately hinges on the assessment of which instruments can address the risks to the outlook most effectively instrument effectiveness however is often highly state and time dependant persistent periods of market stress for example may weaken the transmission of changes in our key interest rates the logic is easy to see a reduction in shortterm riskfree rates typically leads yieldoriented investors to rebalance their portfolios towards riskier assets either along the yield curve or across asset classes this channel is even more powerful when rates are negative it sets strong incentives for investors to move away from shortterm assets so as to ensure nonnegative income flows see slide 4 market stress considerably weakens this portfolio rebalancing channel and although markets have calmed gradually both in the euro area and in the united states stress indicators remain at an elevated level compared to the precrisis period see slide 5 in such conditions two sets of policy measures tend to be most effective those acting directly on banks funding conditions and those such as asset purchases that alleviate investors balancesheet constraints the bankbased measures materially reduce the potentially adverse impact of

addressing covid19 only scratches the surface of what biological innovation can do write michael chui and matthias evers in project syndicate|rarely has the promise of biology commanded as much of the worlds attention as it has during the covid19 crisis as the novel coronavirus infects millions worldwide and ravages the global economy our best hope to overcome it is a new and rapidly evolving generation of biological tools and capabilities but addressing covid19 only scratches the surface of what biological innovation can do advances in biological sciences have been gathering pace since the human genome was mapped – a 13year process completed in 2003 as new research from the mckinsey global institute shows the resulting biorevolution has been driven by rapid progress in computing automation and artificial intelligence ai mgis research identified about four hundred biotech applications already visible in the pipeline of innovation which together could generate up to 4 trillion annually over the next 12 decades more than half of that would fall outside the realm of human health in domains such as agriculture and food consumer products and services and materials chemicals and energy production more than half of the impact is outside of healthcare in agriculture consumer and other areas but the ultimate impact of the biorevolution will be orders of magnitude larger for example as much as 60 of the global economys physical inputs could in principle be produced using biological means this includes not only biological materials onethird but also goods produced using innovative biological processes such as bioplastics twothirds such goods could offer superior performance and sustainability moreover biological innovation could reduce the global disease burden by 13 – roughly equivalent to the combined burden of lung breast and prostate cancer – in the next 1020 years if the full potential of these innovations is realized the global disease burden could be reduced by 45 reaching that point will require us to overcome many challenges both from a scientific perspective and in terms of commercializing and scaling up innovations but here too there are promising trends for starters the cost of mapping the human genome has plummeted – from roughly 3 billion in two thousand and three to less than 1000 in 2016 that figure could drop to less than 100 within a decade the full genome of sarscov2 – the virus that causes covid19 – was sequenced and published within weeks of its identification by contrast it took several months to sequence and publish the genome of sarscov1 the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome after it emerged in 2002 now the sarscov2 genome is being regularly sequenced in different locations in order to examine mutations and gain insight into transmission dynamics another facet of the biological innovation being deployed against covid19 is the substantial improvement in the speed of diagnostics likewise the continual miniaturization of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rtpcr machines state of the art for covid19 testing has made the technology more accessible for use in the field then there is machine learning and other ai technologies which scientists are leveraging to gain insights from huge amounts of genomic and microbiomic data much faster than ever before these capabilities – together with faster and more versatile nucleicacidbased vaccine production – have accelerated the search for a covid19 vaccine considerably by midapril – less than four months after covid19 was officially identified – there were more than one hundred and fifty vaccine candidates in labs around the world after the zika epidemic began in 2015 it took more than a year to launch phase one clinical trials on a possible vaccine but the ability to analyze biological systems and processes is only part of the story at the heart of todays biorevolution is our growing capacity to “engineer” biology using modern geneediting tools such as crisprcas9 with sarscov2 genetically engineered organisms have been used to develop potential therapies for example mice have been genetically engineered to produce monoclonal antibodies and cows to produce polyclonal antibodies furthermore scientists are exploring covid19 treatments that use sirna to interfere with specific molecules or rnai to suppress certain genes other treatments rely on tcells key players in the immune system and stem cells which can be used to make different types of cells in total over two hundred potential covid19 therapies are currently being investigated our increasingly sophisticated ability to mine insights from genomic and microbiomic data and to engineer cells tissues and organs has applications far beyond human health already it is being applied in sectors as diverse as agriculture and the manufacture of textiles and fuels and a new frontier is emerging brainmachine interface applications powered directly by signals from the brain would not only drive a revolution in prosthetics they could also make possible dna data storage the risks of such groundbreaking innovations should not be underestimated for one thing unequal access to biological innovations could deepen socioeconomic disparities – within and across countries moreover biological systems are fundamentally selfsustaining and selfreplicating interfering with them could have profound longlasting and often unpredictable effects on ecosystems when pandoras box is opened what happens next may be beyond our control the value of investment in biological innovation is never as apparent as during a pandemic but such investment must be accompanied by rigorous riskmitigation efforts ideally pursued in a globally coordinated way unfortunately as the largely nationallevel responses to covid19 demonstrate this may pose its own challenge this article first appeared in project

organizations are facing a set of unique challenges as they make decisions about selling general and administrative activities how are leaders dealing with them|this article was written collaboratively by the global leaders of the mckinsey corporate business functions practice a group that spans different regions and includes kyle hawke matt jochim raj luthra rowan mawa juliana pflugfelder abhishek shirali yu ueda and megan wells in “the sga imperative in times of crisis” we looked at how the covid19 pandemic has presented organizations with a unique challenge in making wise spending decisions across their sales general and administrative sga functions the solution to this challenge we argued is to use zerobased principles to move sga investments where they should be—rather than where they have always been we confirm the need for new levels of visibility and thoughtful discussion to help leaders align on priorities in some of the most consequential decisions they face in the findings of the two thousand and twenty sga executive pulse survey the survey asked more than one hundred and ninety cxos and functional leaders across north america and europe and representing a wide range of industries and functions how they are thinking about sga in the months ahead exhibit 1 our findings are described below a majority of executives selected cost management among their top three priorities for the next twelve months together with growth and digital transformation this was true across industries regardless of a companys revenue outlook exhibit 2 the train is leaving the station but lacks direction seven in ten organizations are already tackling sga efficiency and effectiveness another two in ten expect to launch initiatives within six months while actions have been set in motion there is uncertainty around whether such programs can achieve success more than sixty percent of executives reported feeling at least “somewhat unprepared” to meet sga improvement targets this financial year exhibit 3 most executives suggested all sga functions needed to deliver a 1020 percent reduction across the board this alludes to a mindset of “we need to control costs so everyone needs to chip in” rather than a more surgical and thoughtful approach to managing spend exhibit 4 an analysis of individual responses shows sixtyseven percent of executives had less than twenty percent dispersion—the difference between maximum and minimum assigned targets—across functions exhibit 5 in our experience this uniformity tends to raise a dual challenge leaving money on the table in some areas that could be compressed further while implementing unsustainable reductions in others our colleagues have previously shown that those organizations that regularly reevaluate where their resources are channeled create more value and deliver higher returns to shareholders according to our survey seventy percent of executives said they are good at reallocating resources—yet on the flipside sixty percent find it difficult to identify where they can get the best returns exhibit 6 not all activities are created equal the survey revealed that sixtyone percent of sga activities are viewed as needing to have their investment levels adjusted for example in hr organizations are reducing investment in recruiting and onboarding activities exhibit 7 at the same time there is appetite for more investment in workforce planning as well as in activities for engaging and connecting—perhaps explained by increased levels of remote working similarly for indirect spend categories there has been a dramatic reduction in discretionary spending such as travel tradeshows and outside services—some of which can be attributed to government policies and recommendations—while there is a push for more investments in areas such as digital advertising and cybersecurity exhibit 8 organizations must act fast to build up critical workforce capabilities to function in the postcovid19 environment seventytwo percent of our respondents indicate reskilling as being moderate to very important for all functions—and particularly for it sales and supply chain exhibit 9 from the survey results it seems that organizations may be adopting a onesizefitsall approach to improving the performance of sga functions this can have a negative impact on productivity in the long run resulting in resources that are spread too thinly across the business instead saving and then thoughtfully reinvesting resources—such as by identifying and funding one or two breakout moves—can enable businesses to shift their sga spend from cost to investment and focus for the greatest effect on the positive side executives are rallying to address the challenges early and headon launching initiatives to optimize sga in the wake of the crisis also a majority of sga activities are seen in a new light as needing their investment levels adjusted in the coming months sga leaders will have to make tough spending choices that should be informed by where they are getting the most return for their resources and finally adapting employees skills and roles to the postpandemic ways of working will be crucial to building operatingmodel resilience|2020-06-10|0.9955|positive|0.15855555555555553|positive

increase transport time and delay treatment this column examines hospital closures in california from one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfive to two thousand and eleven to assess the effects of rural and urban hospital closures on inpatient mortality mortality increases after a rural hospital closure not only in the local rural area but in the neighbouring urban areas as well this adverse effect is larger for medicaid patients and racial minorities about 15 of all us hospitals have closed since 1990 and the rate of closures has accelerated in recent years in part due to declining inpatient use carroll 2019 lindrooth et al 2003 rural closures have increased since two thousand and ten and 25 of all rural hospitals – of which 82 are considered highly essential to their communities – are at high risk of closing mosley and debehnke 2020 north carolina rural health research program 2020 holmes et al 2017 there have been prominent media outcries regarding the rural hospital crisis including in two thousand and twenty presidential campaign discussions mccausland 2019 tribble 2019 estes 2020 raffa 2019 frakt 2018 internationally too smaller rural and remote hospitals are under the threat of closures vaughan and edwards 2020 low patient volumes low reimbursement rates and costly uncompensated care are commonly cited reasons for weakened hospital finances that lead to closures carroll

to hospital closures federation of american hospitals 2020 mosley and debehnke 2020 ellison 2020 hospital closures pose a conundrum for economists policymakers and hospital administrators closures may seem reasonable and inevitable if hospitals are suffering financially but they can severely fracture patient access and cause enormous harm to patient health kaufman et al 2016 in a wellfunctioning market a firms shutdown often signals underlying inefficiency or low product demand previous studies have shown this to be the case for the hospital industry where closures – especially urban ones – were positively associated with inefficiency capps et al 2010 lindrooth 2003 a large body of literature suggests that the risk of closure is higher for smaller and nonprofit hospitals large hospitals can achieve greater efficiency through economies of scale and forprofit hospitals are more responsive to competitive pressures and can ‘creamskim or choose patients that enhance profitability allen 2017 hodgson et al 2015 lindrooth et al 2003 the natural divide between rural and urban hospitals the cost structure profit motives and patient mix of hospitals thus engender a natural divide between

saghafian 2019 carroll 2019 and economic downturns lead to shrinking populations in rural areas implying lower patient volumes at hospitals populations left behind may be older sicker and more reliant on medicaid and medicare which are financially less favourable payermixes for hospitals making rural hospitals more susceptible to closures and cause for high concern kaufman et al 2016 the same concerns regarding financial viability may also deter new hospitals from entering rural healthcare markets effects of rural hospital closures on patient access and health outcomes efficiency considerations of closures must nonetheless account for their effect on patient welfare urban closures may increase overall patient welfare through by way of cost savings for all patients from the closure of inefficient hospitals capps et al 2010 but patient access and outcomes are also crucial components of patient welfare gaynor and town 2011 even if market forces drive hospital shutdowns closures raise significant concerns about increased transportation time treatment delay and adverse health outcomes especially for emergency care miller et al 2020 carroll 2019 sun et al 2005 wishner et al 2016 patient disutility from access issues can offset utility gains from cost savings particularly in rural markets hsia and shen 2011 mcnamara 1999 compared to studies examining reasons for or the financial impact of closures literature studying the effect of hospital closures both rural and urban on patient outcomes is relatively sparse and lacks consensus largescale published studies have found no impact of closures on patient mortality with some evidence of improved outcomes ie a reduction in mortality for heart attack patients joynt et al 2015 only one published countylevel study buchmueller et al 2006 thus far has shown adverse patientlevel impact ie increased deaths due to urban closures given the recent increase in closures crucial efforts to ascertain the patientlevel impact are currently underway recent working papers song and saghafian 2019 carroll 2019 do find that closures can increase mortality however the emerging and existing work has focused almost exclusively on medicare patients there is a need to also study potentially more vulnerable nonmedicare populations patient outcome studies either examine rural closures while ignoring concurrent urban closures making it difficult to disentangle the isolated effect of rural closures or study the general effect of closures without distinguishing rural from urban however there are baseline and postclosure differences between rural and urban hospitals and markets that suggest potentially different effects of rural and urban closures at baseline rural patients face larger transportation times and access barriers bypass nearby hospitals and are more likely to use hospitals for primary care needs compared to urban patients wishner et al 2016 escarce and kapur 2009 rural patients experience a 76 increase in ambulance transportation time postclosure in their zip code whereas urban patients do not experience any such change postclosure in their zip code troske and davis 2019 while urban patients may shift their usual source of care from hospitals to physicians offices buchmueller et al 2006 no such favourable substitution is observed for rural patients rosenbach and dayhoff 1995 most likely because there are fewer remaining alternatives in rural areas additionally rural closures can lead to immediate substantial and persistent outmigration of healthcare professionals germack et al 2019 manlove and whitacre 2017 dismembering patient access and jeopardising patient outcomes as rural hospitals are an integral part of the communitys economic foundation closures also have dire consequences on the local economy manlove and whitacre 2017 holmes et al 2006 probst et al 1999 given such baseline and postclosure differences the overall adverse effect of a rural hospital closure which includes transportation delays and related spillover effects is likely larger than that of an urban closure our recent working paper gujral and basu 2019 uses a differenceindifference approach to study the impact of rural and urban hospital closures in california in 1995–2011 on adjusted inpatient mortality for timesensitive conditions outcomes of admissions in hospital service areas with and without closures ‘treatment versus ‘control respectively are compared before and after the closure year figure 1 notes map of california showing rural and urban zip codes closure zip codes and hospital service area boundaries that indicate affected patients we focus on 1 the differential effects of rural and urban hospital closures and 2 the effect on medicare as well as nonmedicare populations figure two shows trends in unadjusted inpatient mortality before and after closures the control group and the general nondifferentiated treatment group follow a similar trajectory prior to closure and there does not appear to be any change postclosure for the treatment group figure two unadjusted inpatient mortality for admissions in hospital service areas with and without hospital closures this graphical observation is supported by the differenceindifference estimation wherein we find no measurable impact of closures on inpatient mortality similar to joynt et al 2015 and hsia et al 2012 we then differentiate the treatment group by rurality as shown in figure 3 the lefthand side shows that in urban areas there is no change in unadjusted inpatient mortality after the

rural areas with and without hospital closures notes unadjusted inpatient mortality for control vs urban treatment group top and control vs rural treatment group bottom the differenceindifference estimation shows that rural closures increase inpatient mortality by 87 while urban closures have no measurable impact this suggests that when no distinction is made between rural or urban closures the null effect of urban closures have the potential to dominate and mask the significant and detrimental impact of rural closures our subgroup analyses indicate that medicaid patients and racial

of covid19 this column examines mobility patterns across us counties between midfebruary and midmay 2020 it finds that reductions in mobility differed across counties and that communitylevel social capital can explain the geographic variations in mobility trends individuals reduced mobility earlier and to a higher degree in counties with high levels of social capital many counties particularly in the southeast us may be especially vulnerable to covid19 matching low levels of social capital with high rates of chronic disease until a vaccine or effective pharmacological treatments for covid19 become widely available individuals can protect themselves and others around them through a combination of social distancing and behavioural changes that reduce transmission when contacts occur the scientific community has highlighted the importance of limiting social contacts and governments worldwide have either advised or mandated shelteringinplace orders to promote behavioural changes hartl et al 2020 however social distancing has major economic and social consequences for both individuals and communities glover et al 2020 coibion et al 2020 therefore rather than a prolonged period of strict distancing until treatment or immunisation make social gatherings safe coexisting with the virus is most likely to entail the monitoring of local epidemiological curves and by a sequence of tighter and looser restrictions moving in sync with such curves it is therefore important to identify what factors are associated with individuals and communities being able to alter their behaviour either voluntarily or in compliance with regulations evidence from the h1n1 pandemic reveals that the likelihood that individuals implemented behavioural changes in two thousand and nine to reduce h1h1 transmission depended among other things on their social capital chuang et al 2015 rönnerstrand 2013 2014 social capital reflects the resources and benefits that individuals and groups acquire through connections with others and involves both shared norms and values that promote cooperation as well as actual social relationships kawachi et al 2008 evidence on the role of social capital in shaping behavioural responses during the covid19 pandemic is beginning to emerge see borgonovi and andrieu 2020 bargain and aminjonov 2020 durante et al 2020 we contribute to this line of work by examining data from us counties to identify how communities with different levels of social capital responded to the threat posed by covid19 by changing one type of behaviour mobility we examine mobility patterns between seventeen february when there was little awareness of the public health threat posed by covid19 among the general population in the us and ten may by which point as many as 13 million individuals had been diagnosed with covid19 and about eighty thousand were reported to have died because of covid19 data on countylevel social capital come from the “the geography of social capital” project and mobility data come from the cuebiqs mobility index cmi data from cuebiq has been used to map movements in italian provinces prior to and following the implementation of restrictions to movement because of covid19 figure one reveals that both communities with high levels of social capital counties in top quarter of the social capital index and communities with low levels of social capital counties in bottom quarter of the index changed their mobility patterns between seventeen february and ten may mobility was already lower at baseline in areas with higher levels of social capital and decreased markedly in such areas from the week starting on nine march onwards such communities reduced mobility sooner than communities with lower levels of social capital ie when reducing mobility was not yet legally mandated these communities also reduced mobility to a much greater extent than communities with lower levels of social capital mobility returned close to baseline in both high and low social capital communities by ten may although observing mobility levels in midmay that are comparable to those observed in february should be viewed as a form of behavioural change mobility tends to be greater when the days are longer and weather conditions are more favourable to outdoor activities figure one changes in mobility in us counties in high and low social capital communities results presented in figure one do not consider differences across counties with different levels of social capital which may also shape behavioural responses during the pandemic in figure 2 we highlight the weekly evolution in mobility differentials across counties that are associated with a one standard deviation difference in social capital after accounting for countylevel characteristics weather conditions the number of covid19 cases diagnosed the week before if the county was subject to shelterinplace orders in the week under analysis the percentage of votes cast that were in favour of trump in the two thousand and sixteen presidential elections the primary economic activity of the county population density the share of people over 65 and the share of people living in poverty as well as state fixed effects figure two social capital differentials in mobility between seventeen february and ten may in the us notes the balanced panel covers two thousand seven hundred and fifteen counties which account for 96 of the total us population in 2018 all models are based on cuebiq mobility trends data dependent variable mobility index the figure highlights the change in mobility associated with a one standard deviation difference in social capital while accounting for weather conditions precipitations the number of covid19 cases diagnosed the week before if the county was subject to shelterinplace orders in the week the percentage of votes cast that were in favour of trump in the two thousand and sixteen presidential elections the economic dependence of the county reference category undifferentiated economic activity population density the share of people over 65 and the share of people in poverty figure two illustrates the average within state between county variation in mobility between seventeen february and ten may that is associated with a difference of one standard deviation in social capital it indicates that the social capital differential in mobility became very large between march and thirteen april and decreased from thirteen april on but remained statistically significant this result should be considered in light of figure 1 at the start of the study period the differential occurred while levels of mobility were declining while at the end of the study period the differential occurred when overall mobility levels were increasing crucially the social capital differential grew before shelterinplace orders were implemented because behavioural changes in the early stages of covid19 are crucial to halt the spread of the virus before cases start to rise exponentially dave et al 2020 these findings are particularly relevant they also indicate that although shelteringinplace orders can effectively alter individual behaviours across all communities they are especially effective in communities with high levels of social capital in order to evaluate the likely risk different communities face because of covid19 we combine information on communitylevel social capital and the prevalence of chronic conditions such as diabetes obesity high blood pressure lung disease and heart disease in the population individuals with preexisting conditions are in fact more likely to face complications if infected with covid19 jordan 2020 we consider counties with a high prevalence of chronic conditions and low levels of social capital to be very vulnerable while counties with a low prevalence of chronic conditions and high levels of social capital to have low levels of vulnerability figure three indicate that many counties particularly in the southeast face very high levels of vulnerability combining high rates of chronic conditions and low levels of social capital sources authors calculations based on data from wwwpolicymapcom risk index and “the geography of social capital” social capital index our findings may be important not only to evaluate what happened in the early phase of the covid19 pandemic in the us but also to consider where efforts should be put as legal barriers to the sarscov2 virus are relaxed governments around the world have lifted some of the restrictions to movement that were implemented in february and march two thousand and twenty when the number of covid19 cases rapidly increased our work suggests that the stock of social capital in a community is a crucial factor reinforcing the social capital available in a community when this is present and supporting communities when social capital is lacking should be just as much of a priority as sourcing stocks of face masks or testing kits to protect population health bargain o and u aminjonov 2020 “trust and compliance to public health policies in times of covid19” iza dp no

|hallenstein glasson holdings remains tippedlipped on any plans to close stores in its womens and menswear retail chains the nzxlisted retailer which operates hallenstein brothers and glassons stores in new zealand and australia has warned that it expects to post a 28 million loss for the fourteen weeks to april 30 it is hopeful its fourthquarter sales will improve mary devine group managing director of hallenstein glasson said it was early days and too soon to know the full impact of covid19 asked about any costcutting measures the group would undertake in the months ahead devine said she could not disclose specifics read more • clothing chain max prepares to shut seventeen stores • premium  warehouse group ceo on move to agile store closures • warehouse group proposes axing more than one thousand jobs • michael hill closing nine stores globally three in nz forecasts further closures the group was now starting to get a feel for how it was trading after lockdown in the changed environment and would make decisions on a storebystore basis she said our position at the moment is as leases come up for renewal well continue to take a strategic view and evaluate accordingly devine told the herald now with reopening stores were finding our rhythm as business we have been pleased about the initial response weve had but overall were remaining cautious because we do think there is going to be a challenging economic environment ahead the typically mediashy company said it had experienced a strong uplift in online sales even after the reopening of its bricks and mortar stores a large portion of which it expected to be permanent online sales accounted for more than fifteen per cent of all group sales in its first six months of its current financial year devine could not disclose the revised proportion of online sales in its latest nzx update hallenstein glasson said it anticipated trade profitability from may onwards but at lower levels compared to the same period last year due to a likely decrease in foottraffic increased levels of unemployment and related economic impacts devine said retailers were already looking at downsizing their store portfolios even before covid19 hit overall in retail we are getting increasing traction via digital and online business i think there was a general sentiment particularly over the last eighteen months that retailers have been quite critical of what is the appropriate store portfolio coming through the covid experience weve all experienced uplift in our online sales so i think that makes all retailers more critical of what the appropriate store portfolio is going forward the sustained increase in online sales after the stores reopened showed that consumers had become more comfortable with shopping online devine said its fascinating times in retail because just what the state of the landscape is going to be in six months time will be interesting for us all she said bricks and mortar are still fundamentally part of the retail experience for customers people love to come into store and touch and feel product  the ultimate right balance between digital and bricks and mortar i think that is going to evolve over time over the past two years hallenstein glasson has invested in its online shopping channels to accommodate an increase in ecommerce sales it has invested in all three of its distribution centres in christchurch auckland and sydney in february it moved into a brand distribution facility in sydney and completed its glassons new zealand distribution centre in october and hallensteins centre in the middle of last year the group deployed its retail staff to its distribution centres to fulfil online orders during lockdown the investment weve made in those distribution centres has been highly relevant devine said weve been fortunate that ecommerce has been a clear area of focus for the business for recent times and were starting to dividends now of that investment hallenstein glasson employs more than one thousand six hundred staff across its one hundred and twentysix stores in new zealand and australia its current financial year will end next month in its

stags player scott eade is shining a spotlight on southland rugby as the skipper of a new podcast which has quickly attracted a strong fan following|southland stags player scott eade is the host of a new podcast that looks at all things rugby in southland stags player scott eade is shining a spotlight on southland rugby as the skipper of a new podcast which has quickly attracted a strong fan following the 27yearold has combined with fellow marist clubmen jeremy boyle and ukbased bryce morgan to create the brains trust rugby pod which describes itself as a look at all things rugby in the deep south “a mix of serious footy chat with a bit of banter thrown in” at a time when rugby has been little more than a romantic memory and there was even less certainty about when or even if the season would get underway the pod has scratched an itch and attracted about two thousand five hundred listeners after just eight episodes not bad for what is a reasonably niche subject read more  scott eade to make southland stags return  southland stags better against manawatu but win still eludes them  scott eade to bring up fifty game milestone for the southland stags “we thought wed just give it a crack and the first couple went alright and so weve just stuck at it” eade told southlandsportcom eade who combines his rugby with a role as a development officer with touch southland studied journalism after high school and has an interest in media generally hes also become a fan of the podcast medium and when lockdown provided him with a bit more spare time the gem of an idea which hed had for a while sprouted while working for rugby southland as the unions womens development officer eade had seen the decline in club rugby coverage and began thinking about ways the void could be filled “weve had a few messages from people who know us or have enjoyed hearing about club footy theres quite a few boys who are from southland but are living in aussie or the uk it gives them an idea of whats going on back here” eade said “i suppose thats given myself and now jeremy and bryce the motivation to keep going with it now that we are about to start the season it will be good to get into some weekly wraps and get some guys on from different clubs and teams” despite letting itself down somewhat with its unashamed greenandblack bias – full disclosure i am a blues supporter – the podcast has struck a delightful balance between the humourous eg the selection of a southland alltime under 85kg team and the serious eg the always contentious debate around the value of the easternnorthern barbarians concept another interesting recent debate centred around whether the standard of club rugby in southland had declined over the past twenty years “when we started we talked about the fact people dont just want to listen to serious stuff” eade said “we have a bit of a laugh about things but we dont shy away from polarising topics we had ben mckerchar on last week and hes never short of a word we knew that he would give his honest opinion” another strength of a longerform platform like a podcast is that it creates the time and space to develop a deeper story as the brains trust has done with indepth interviews with current and former stags players javaan faamoe ioane and liam howley its a chance to let the subject tell their own story something thats hard to encapsulate in five hundred words the podcast has also provided eade with a rugby outlet at a time when hes desperately needed one his two thousand and nineteen season came to an abrupt end at a stags training run when he dislocated his shoulder so badly he had to go to hospital to get it put back in surgery and then a long rehab followed with the club season beckoning covid19 stepped up and changed the game again “its felt like forever to be fair especially for me because i did my shoulder right back at the start of september last year i was just in the process of getting back into playing and then the pandemic happened” eade said “there was that period when we werent even sure if we were going to play club and there were murmurs that there might not be a mitre ten cup or that southland wouldnt be in it its exciting to be back with the marist boys and just chucking a ball around really” marist will take on woodlands in a preseason game this weekend another tangible sign that some sort of normality is returning to the southland way of life eade isnt expecting to take over the world with the brains trust but hes interested to see where it goes next “i dont really have any expectations of it getting too big or anything it was more just about entertaining people who have an interest in southland rugby want to listen to a few yarns and get an idea of whats going on” he said “well just keep plugging away and hopefully a few people tune in” • the brains trust – rugby pod can be found on apple podcasts and spotify|2020-06-10|0.9986|positive|0.08500514670514668|positive

oil prices have seen an unprecedented rebound in the past two months but the market isnt in the clear just yet|bullish sentiment appears to have returned to the stock markets with a vengeance in a historic rally that has taken even diehard bulls by surprise the sp five hundred has managed to claw back all of its two thousand and twenty losses taking just fiftythree sessions for the index to fully restore the nearly 10t in value it shed in an epic bear market the oil markets have been nearly as impressive after entering negative territory for the first time in history us wti prices have briefly touched 40bbl amid record production cuts and an uptick in global demand oil and gas stocks have doubled from their march twentythree nadir marking a sharp reversal from the precipitous drop that wiped out nearly two decades of gains theres no shortage of bottom fishing opportunities in this market with shares of bankrupt or nearbankrupt shale companies including whiting petroleum nysewll

recording tripledigit gains over the past week alone but analysts are now saying investors need to pump their brakes a crosssection of wall street has warned that theres too much irrational exuberance in the markets and the oil price rally is not fully supported by fundamentals source cnn money according to warren patterson head of commodities strategy at ing as well as analysts at goldman sachs refining margins aka crack spreads across different regions around the globe are still way off their norms portending continuing weak global demand for distillates us crack spreads clocked in at a mere 9bbl last week compared to 21 at the same time last year according to reuters while crack spreads for european diesel dropped to a record low of 290 related the true impact of covid19 on natural gas demand crack spreads are a good proxy for oil demand with falling spreads a sign of weak demand and viceversa the badly squeezed margins for refiners is a worrying sign that global demand remains way below normal levels with the ongoing pickup in crude prices only serving to worsen the margin contraction for the likes of valero energy corp nysevlo marathon petroleum corp nysempc and phillips sixtysix nyse psx wti and brent prices have staged a strong rally over the past few weeks after production cuts by opec and independent producers in the us and elsewhere helped ease a huge supply glut and storage buildup on saturday opec and its allies agreed to extend the cuts by an additional month with plans to review progress on a monthly basis global oil demand particularly in the giant markets of china and india appears to be recovering at a fasterthanexpected clip with crude imports in china surging 13 in may to a record 113 million barrels per day and demand back to 90 of precrisis levels meanwhile may sales in india were recorded at 76 of normal levels while us gasoline demand has seen a 7 uptick during the final week of may to clock in at 75 of precovid19 levels but analysts are now questioning whether the rebound in demand is the result of rising consumption or simply the result of refiners and traders stocking up on cheap crude ings patterson and ehsan khoman at japanese bank mufg say the surge in demand could partly be the result of opportunistic buying by refiners consequently goldman has predicted that brent prices will pull back to 35 per barrel in the coming weeks from a recent high of 43 according to bloomberg the united states largest refiner by capacity valero energy is currently running its two crude units at just 58 of their maximum rate of 424k bblday due to low demand and storage filling up the refinerys fluid catalytic converter as well as all the hydrotreaters except the distillate hydrotreaters are running at minimum rates while rates on the coker have also been lowered in a previous article we reported that giant oil traders have been storing millions of barrels of crude in the seas with a view to selling when prices improve in the coming months which could also be driving the surge in demand at this juncture its best for investors to adopt an attitude of cautious optimism on one hand the bulls argue that opec has curtailed production too fast with some oil executives eyeing the seemingly untouchable wti prices of 70 in the current year on the other hand poor refining margins are telling a different story while oil prices have worryingly been strongly pulling back from recent highs on fears that increased production by us shale producers and libya will offset the opec cuts as many analysts have pointed out the biggest wild card in this market remains the speed at which demand is going to bounce back in the coming months the current evidence though appears to lend support to the bull

the european central bank ecb is the central bank of the nineteen european union countries which have adopted the euro our main task is to maintain price stability in the euro area and so preserve the purchasing power of the single currency|interview with philip r lane member of the executive board of the ecb conducted by isabella bufacchi on eight june the ecb does not tolerate fragmentation yet the pandemic is making the eurozone more fragmented than ever because fiscal responses and economic and social damage are asymmetric italy is at the forefront as one of the hardesthit countries with less fiscal space and high public debt how will italys recovery out of the covid19 crisis be helped by the ecb and by being a member of the euro this pandemic is a severe shock for all countries it is a truly global shock italys gdp projections are a little bit below the average euro area baseline scenario the banca ditalia sees gdp contracting by 92 in italy this year compared to a euro area average of 87 but most importantly the whole euro area is going through a big recession this year and not only is the entire euro area severely affected but being part of the euro area also provides a lot of benefits in terms of responding to the shock we had a pandemic which is a common shock and a common response from the ecb as the common central bank this is very important since it is unlikely that individually all countries could have responded on the same scale when this big shock arrived in the middle of march the ecb responded decisively to stabilise financial markets because there was a huge dislocation the ecb showed it could be an anchor of stability and prevent selffulfilling dynamics that otherwise could have escalated in this respect the ecbs pandemic emergency purchase programme pepp has so far played two roles in the pandemic first it provides a market stabilisation tool and second it helps to make sure that the tightening of financial conditions was offset the ecb has stabilised the markets because conditions were getting tighter how severe was the tightening and do you see some signs of normalisation in the middle of march the world realised that covid19 was going to be a really very large shock and financial markets had to adjust to all this very quickly but when a shock is so large and uncertainty exceptionally high it is difficult to have adjustments that are orderly and smooth so it was very important for central banks in the world to step in to stabilise financial conditions however compared to before the crisis financial conditions are still tighter now the stock markets are lower and the average sovereign yield for euro area member states is higher than before the shock and these tighter financing conditions would be passed on to firms and households to address this we took the decision to expand the pepp last week we assessed those conditions and we decided we had to do more in the initial phase of the pepp market stabilisation was particularly important now we want to make sure that stability stays but also that financial conditions are sufficiently accommodative to support the economic recovery and counter the substantial negative shock to the inflation trajectory in just less than three months the pepp has become bigger and longer from €750 billion to €1350 billion and extended from december two thousand and twenty to june 2021 but now we have two purchase programmes running the app and the pepp what is the difference between these two programmes why do we need two before the pandemic the ecb had been on a sustained mission since two thousand and fifteen to strengthen inflation and to bring it closer to the governing councils inflation aim to this end we were using a package of instruments the asset purchase programme app the targeted longerterm refinancing operations tltro iii programme the level of our key policy rates and forward guidance then the pandemic arrived and our projections indicate that this shock is having a significant negative impact on inflation as regards the role of the app and the pepp we can draw a clear distinction in the background we have the traditional suite of policy instruments but to deal with the unique and severe pandemic shock we needed an additional and temporary tool so it made sense to have two purchase programmes the “traditional” app and the pandemic programme the pepp is here to make sure the downside shock from the pandemic is addressed however even after the coronavirus crisis phase is over inflation will still be far from our inflation aim so the app will still be needed by the way the horizon of the app is openended in a statecontingent fashion the horizon for app asset purchases is conditional on the ecbs governing council seeing a robust convergence of inflation to our aim the pepp is “more temporary” than the app yet the maturing principal payments from securities purchased under the pepp will be reinvested until at least the end of 2022 so it looks like a very long temporary period of time… at our meeting last week we extended the horizon of net purchases under the pepp to june 2021 although in any case we will conduct net asset purchases under the pepp until we judge that the coronavirus crisis phase is over the june two thousand and twentyone horizon broadly aligns the pepp net purchase horizon with the horizons of our other monetary policy measures taken in response to the pandemic such as our targeted lending programmes and collateral measures as regards the reinvestment of maturing principals under the pepp we indeed announced that we would make reinvestments until at least the end of 2022 we want to make sure that the reinvestment strategy avoids the risk of an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions at a time when the recovery from the pandemic shock remains incomplete it is also important that the management of the winddown phase will not interfere with the ongoing conduct of monetary policy at the same time it is appropriate that the reinvestment strategy for the pepp reflects its temporary nature and link to the pandemic emergency the end of two thousand and twentytwo is a reasonable guide to the horizon for this also as this horizon coincides with that of our macroeconomic projections the temporary nature of the pepp is clear but not so clear on reinvestments the reinvestments of the app a programme that started in march 2015 are still going on in italy there is a widespread wishful thinking that ecb reinvestments will go on forever becoming a proxy of debt monetisation even if the ecb cannot finance governments directly the interest rates needed for the world economy are much lower now than they were twentyfive years ago this is not unique to the ecb or the euro area the reason why interest rates are so low has to do with many factors such as demography and productivity among others right now these forces are putting downward pressure on inflation central banks globally are fighting against low inflation and are engaged in asset purchases to do that but our central bank actions are motivated by our monetary policy mandate if the inflation outlook changes then central bank policies will adjust as well we do not know where interest rates will be in the future because we do not know where inflation will be in the next three five or ten years the advocates of debt monetisation claim that central banks will keep public debt no matter what this is not the case and anyway the treaty does not allow us to undertake debt monetisation you refer to a world of very low interest rates tltro iii goes as low as 1 but does this mean that an interest rate cut is off the table now our key policy rate the deposit facility rate is at 05 for banks participating in our targeted lending programme that lend sufficiently the tltro iii operations offer a rate as low as 1 this provides an incentive to banks to keep the flow of credit to firms and households going when it comes to our policy rate we are ready to adjust it if necessary as is true for all our instruments we made our last cut of the policy rate in september of last year in the current environment of exceptional uncertainty and remaining stress in financial markets asset purchases within the pepp have proven a particularly effective tool so we focused on these in our most recent decision are you satisfied with tltros and more lending with pandemic emergency longerterm refinancing operations and bridge longerterm refinancing operations to avoid a credit crunch we have learnt a lot from previous crises an important part of our lending programmes is to incentivise banks to lend to households and firms this is especially important when risks go up and the revenues of firms are hit we have also revised our collateral framework we expanded the set of eligible collateral against which banks can borrow from the ecb this allows banks to lend more to the real economy as a modern central bank we recognise how important it is for households and small and mediumsized enterprises smes in europe to obtain credit and our decisions in march and april addressed this the highly attractive pricing of tltro iii will run until next year we are determined to make sure that this crisis is not made worse by an avoidable credit crunch liquidity is there for sure but does it go to smes or does it inflate financial bubbles what we have seen in the last weeks is a restoration of investor confidence in the european economy back in the middle of march global investors were asking themselves whether european policymakers would respond appropriately to the shock would the ecb response be enough how would the european institutions respond to the pandemic would there be enough solidarity at the ecb we have responded decisively not only with our monetary policy but also through supervisory measures moreover the response by national governments and at european level has also been centre stage i think now with all the various instruments in place global investors have improved their opinion of the european response so one thing we see in

policy and strategy relevant to the pandemic the journal has initiated the covid19 notes series the first person with confirmed covid19 in south africa was a traveler who had returned from italy and was diagnosed on march 5 2020 when four hundred and two cases had been identified after eighteen days the government announced a national lockdown which was implemented four days later when the doubling time was two days and there were one thousand one hundred and seventy identified cases figure 1a during thirtyfive days of strict lockdown the doubling time slowed to fifteen days and there were five thousand six hundred and fortyseven cases including one hundred and three deaths by april 30 as of may 19 when a less strict lockdown was in place south africa had recorded 17200 cases and three hundred and twelve deaths and had conducted 488609 tests wwwgovzacoronavirus south africas national covid19 response has comprised eight overlapping stages the first stage was focused on preparing for covid19 including establishing testing capacity stage two started when there were fiftyone cases ten days after the first south african patient was diagnosed the government declared a national state of disaster banning international travel closing schools restricting gatherings and promoting social distancing and hand hygiene a highlevel advisory committee with fiftyone clinicians virologists epidemiologists mathematical modelers public health practitioners and other experts is providing strategic advice to the minister of health and establishing evidencebased policy guidance stage three consisted of the national lockdown which is now being eased slowly the lockdown has caused substantial economic hardship especially among poor and vulnerable people the contraction of the economy could have important longterm consequences restrictions on movement and the risk of contracting covid19 in health care facilities has brought major reductions in the use of health services thereby compromising continuity of care for people with hiv tuberculosis tb and chronic noncommunicable diseases during stage 4 which was initiated on day 33 the government has deployed more than 28000 community health workers to the highestrisk communities to undertake active housetohouse case finding south africas community contacttracing teams established for tb control have been used for covid19 contact tracing and monitoring of compliance with quarantine with the highest hiv burden in the world the country has a network of providers including tens of thousands of trained community health workers experienced in conducting doortodoor visits in socially vulnerable communities this communitybased response has been used to screen 11114600 people almost 20 of the population for covid19 a mobilephone application is used to administer a symptom checklist and data for each household are uploaded along with mobilephone location coordinates to a central database to map screening coverage people with covid19 symptoms are referred to mobile testing stations or nearby health facilities stage five involves identification of hot spots and implementation of prevention measures in areas with localized outbreaks stage six is focused on providing medical care including constructing field hospitals — some in convention centers stage seven involves preparing for deaths burials and the mental health challenges associated with bereavement the final stage focuses on staying vigilant by engaging in casefinding activities and monitoring population immunity levels using serosurveys in preparation for subsequent epidemic waves several challenges may hinder epidemic control the country is trying to further scale up testing from the current cumulative rate of 96 tests per one thousand people initially restrictive criteria made it difficult for people to get tested in public clinics and hospitals with privatesector providers conducting about 80 of tests the criteria were changed after about one month and most testing now occurs in the public sector securing sufficient testing supplies and personal protective equipment for health care personnel has been challenging poverty and unemployment mean many people live in informal settlements where implementing preventive interventions such as hand washing and social distancing is difficult these vulnerable communities utilize public health care services more than 80 of south africans dont have medical insurance there were 79 million people living with hiv and about a quarter million incident cases of tb in south africa in 2018 covid19 could add severe strain to the already overburdened health care system particularly if people with hiv or tb are at higher risk of developing severe covid19 illness the potential for a double whammy looms as south africa prepares to enter its annual influenza season south africas early interventions have delayed the covid19 peak figure 1b its response is being

nevertheless as this column reveals the centre for macroeconomics panel was nearly unanimous that the treasury should not take any action to decrease the deficit in the upcoming budget the panel is split on when it would be wise to publicly announce longrun plans to address the deficit and the debt the majority of the panel supports a mix of financing options when action is taken with tax increases receiving strong support and not a single panellist supporting public spending cuts the uk government has supported the economy with a variety of measures in response to the covid19 crisis this has led to an unprecedented increase in public deficits in peacetime the office for budget responsibility forecasts a budget deficit of £300 billion this year more than 15 of uk gdp public debt is expected to exceed 100 of gdp by the end of the year despite this increased borrowing the uk government is borrowing at negative rates for horizons of up to three years and can currently borrow at 50year maturities for less than half a percent annually internal treasury documents indicate that the exchequer has begun planning measures to reduce the deficit in upcoming years goodhart and pradhan 2020 predict rising inflation if public and private debts arent addressed others have suggested that it is premature to take action or even commence planning for deficit reduction nick macpherson a former top treasury official said “you dont want to have a budget while the crisis is in full throttle” paul johnson of the institute of fiscal studies suggests waiting until the end of 2021 “once we have a better idea how well the economy has recovered” the economist has also opined that “richworld governments will make a big mistake if they succumb to premature and excessive worries about budgets” in this months cfm survey panellists were asked about the urgency of deficit reduction and how this deficit reduction should be achieved question one how urgently should the uk government address the rise in public debt thirty panellists responded to this question the panel was nearly unanimous one dissent that no measures should be taken in the upcoming budget the vast majority of the panel 63 stated that there was no need to take any action or announce budgetary changes to address public debt until the pandemic subsided the remaining panellists were split on whether the government should present concrete plans sooner rather than later 20 or that focus on the public debt was counterproductive 13 uncertainty on the scale and duration of the pandemic and its economic consequences was the main argument for postponing the discussion on public debt david cobham heriotwatt university thinks it “best to wait until some of the dust at least has settled otherwise we cant see what were doing” thorsten beck cass business school elaborated that at this stage “it is not even clear how long the pandemic will last and how many waves there will be and what the ultimate economic cost will be” panellists furthermore didnt see room for concern that requires immediate action wouter den haan london school of economics notes that “we know countries like the uk can deal with high debt levels and right now there are obviously more important concerns” some participants like john van reenen london school of economics views austerity during the global financial crisis as a mistake from which we should now learn those supporting longterm plans raised concerns that ignoring the deficit entirely would create uncertainty that might hamper the recovery ricardo reis london school of economics notes that “having a clear longterm plan for fiscal policy would anchor expectations it would remove one of the usually bigger sources of uncertainty for investment” kate barker british coal staff superannuation scheme suggests that instead of a plan “hmt should introduce a few measures but launch a consultation on the pace of deficit reduction and tax and spend measures” she also notes that this would be an opportunity to address some longerterm challenges “the national infrastructure statement is needed to help with recovery and the way forward on climate change and it would be very appropriate for a proper policy on social care finally to get the priority it deserves” while only 20 of panellists supported longterm plans to address the deficit a few supporters of the majority view implied in their comments that longterm fiscal plans would be wise the minority opposing plans to address the public debt in the foreseeable future instead expressed concern that excessive focus on the public debt would come at the expense of aiding the recovery simon wrenlewis university of oxford for example opposes any budgetary deficit reduction unless interest rates begin to rise wendy carlin university college london also asked that the discussion be shifted from public debt concerns to “minimizing the damage to education rd investment startups etc and on supporting incomes until economic activity can resume” a debate has emerged on financing methods for the massive increases in government debt worldwide the most direct way to reduce deficits is by cutting public spending or increasing tax revenues the treasurys internal estimates suggest that freezing public sector pay for two years would lead to savings of £65 billion by 202324 the social market foundation points to the generous indexing of public pensions the triple lock as an attractive target for spending reductions although the conservative party manifesto promised no increases in income vat or national insurance taxes the treasury is contemplating tax hikes the chancellor has indicated that the crisis might be an opportunity to increase selfemployment national insurance tax rates to better align with those of wage earners the labour manifesto called for wealth taxation even prior to the pandemic although support for such measures from labours new leadership is yet to be seen the financial times provides a useful summary and a podcast on the panoply of budgetary measures that could be used to reduce the public debt debt reduction efforts following wwii point to other debt reduction strategies public debts of highincome countries eroded through a combination of higher inflation and artificially low interest rates supported by regulatory measures such as capital controls financial repression a number of commentators have advocated a return to these practices adam tooze points to these historical experiences and proposes direct monetary financing of deficits “under ordinary circumstances one might worry about that causing inflation but given the recession we face that is a risk worth running indeed modest inflation would help us by taking a bite out of the real value of the debt” willem buiter has suggested that increasing inflation targets to 5 would do the trick but notes little appetite for such policies in highincome countries following the napoleonic wars the uk took a different approach of issuing consols or perpetual bonds the us took a similar approach following the civil war and the uk issued some consols following wwi these are bonds that never mature but whose coupons are serviced indefinitely george soros has advocated issuing consols to address covid19related public debt and the spanish government has proposed these debt instruments as a way to finance recovery efforts in the euro area see also giavazzi and tabellini two thousand and twenty and verhofstadt and garicanos april fifteen editorial corsetti et al two thousand and twenty argue against these instruments current yields on uk bonds are at unprecedented lows economic growth could reduce the deficit and debt as a share of gdp but it is unclear which policies would guarantee higher economic growth in current circumstances in this regard the cfm panel was asked question two what is the best way to eventually reduce public deficits and debt thirty panellists responded to this question many respondents supported a policy mix that involves more than one of the proposed policies several respondents expressed hopes that economic growth would do its share in reducing the effective size of the public debt in ranking individual policies respondents were nearly equally split between those supporting tax increases and those supporting the issuance of perpetual bonds with 30 support for each although supporters of tax increases expressed greater confidence a smaller share 13 supported higher inflation not a single panellist expressed support for public spending increases or financial repression supporters of tax increases noted that the uk public sector whose importance the covid19 crisis has further underlined has been stretched for some time tony yates university of birmingham argues that “a larger and more resilient state is likely to be needed to put us in a better position to fight future pandemics and also to redress some for the regressive aspects of them” jagjit chadha national institute of economic and social research notes that “we have a sustained increase in the demand for the provision of public goods” kate barker british coal staff superannuation scheme suggests that higher taxation might be necessary to support the economic recovery she writes “there is a high risk that the betteroff will continue to save more  taxing in order to support demand may be important  and in the longer run part of the deficit reduction” andrew mountford royal holloway suggested specific tax measures including “property tax as the most efficient way to do so and to use the revenues not only for debt reduction but also for substantial public investments” supporters of perpetuities pointed out that the uk

york today|following are un secretarygeneral antónio guterres remarks to the virtual highlevel meeting on the “impact of rapid technological change on the achievement of the sustainable development goals” in new york today managing rapid technological change is a defining challenge of our generation the digital revolution affects every country and territory and all areas of our lives the internet is a powerful and essential global public good that requires the highest possible level of international cooperation yet fundamental pillars of that cooperation are lacking as we address this gap we face a new global challenge the covid19 pandemic which is causing unprecedented human suffering and economic hardship around the world far from distracting us from the urgency of digital cooperation covid19 is making it more important than ever and demonstrating the interconnected nature of the challenges we face digital technology is central to almost every aspect of the response to the pandemic from vaccine research to online learning models ecommerce and tools that are enabling hundreds of millions of people to work and study from home but the digital divide is now a matter of life and death for people who are unable to access essential health‑care information it is threatening to become the new face of inequality reinforcing the social and economic disadvantages suffered by women and girls people with disabilities and minorities of all kinds in 2019 some eightyseven per cent of people in developed countries used the internet compared with just nineteen per cent in the least developed countries at the same time covid19 has provided dramatic evidence of the threats posed by the ungoverned use of digital technology from exclusion and inequality to surveillance human rights abuses and cybercrime the pandemic has ushered in some of the most intrusive surveillance technologies we have ever seen together with a significant increase in cynical ransomware attacks on hospitals and health‑care facilities meanwhile the danger of digital fragmentation is increasing exacerbated by geopolitical divides technological competition and polarization we are at a turning point we urgently need to harness the infinite opportunities offered by digital technology in order to scale up our efforts on health care on the climate crisis on eradicating poverty and across all the sustainable development goals but to realize these opportunities we must move forward in the digital age with increased international cooperation based on mutual trust two years ago i initiated a process to chart a way forward the overarching goal has been to increase international digital cooperation to optimize the use of digital technologies and mitigate the risks the report of the highlevel panel on digital cooperation cochaired by melinda gates and jack ma has guided the past year of consultations with member states the private sector civil society and academia i thank everyone involved the recommendations from the highlevel panel report emphasized the need to close the digital divide grow human and institutional capacity for the digital age uphold human rights in digital contexts build cybertrust and security and agree on a new global architecture for digital cooperation all these perspectives have contributed to the development of the road map for digital cooperation which i am pleased to present today the road map outlines concrete actions for member states the private sector civil society the technology community and the global public to connect respect and protect people in the digital age to connect — by providing universal safe inclusive affordable internet access by 2030 to respect — by putting human rights and human dignity at the centre of everything we do online as well as off to protect — by tackling the abuses and violations that threaten the security of people communities organizations and economies and by reducing the danger of fragmentation the road map sets out to achieve these aims through concrete steps in eight areas first achieving universal connectivity together we can ensure that every person has safe and affordable access to the internet by 2030 second recognizing and promoting digital public goods through common standards on open data we must halt and reverse the decline in the proportion of the internet that is opensource and publicly available while respecting privacy and confidentiality third making targeted efforts to include the most vulnerable who are at greatest risk of being left behind this includes addressing the digital gender gap which is growing fourth building digital capacity in every country through expanded training programmes and support fifth ensuring the protection of human rights in the digital era international human rights law must apply online and off sixth providing global vision and leadership on the development of artificial intelligence — an area that poses some of the greatest challenges to governance seventh promoting digital trust and security to advance the sustainable development goals finally building a more effective architecture for digital cooperation we are only beginning to understand the social implications of a post‑covid‑19 world but one thing is certain as we recover and rebuild digital technology will be more prominent and important than ever those without access will be left further behind we cannot reap the full benefits of the digital age without mobilizing global cooperation to close digital gaps and reduce potential harms we urgently need global vision and leadership for our digitally interdependent world the road map for digital cooperation calls on everyone — governments the private sector civil society the tech community academia and the global public — to take concrete action together to address the most pressing issues of the digital age i count on your strong support future generations

metrics that had caused alarm at intake were tachycardia and tachypnea but there was no fever or hypotension in this middleaged woman on exam she was indeed breathing quickly and had a rapid regular pulse but there were clues beyond the vital signs as to the cause of her distress her eyes were as wide as her dilated pupils her skin was diaphoretic and her feet tapped percussively on the tile floor after some questioning all evidence pointed to a hyperadrenergic response to extreme anxiety i am a medical oncologist with distressing frequency i tell people they have cancer adding a brutal coda for many that their condition is incurable a consultation with me is often accompanied by the tinnitus of terror — the patient hears the declarative confirmation of malignancy and then nothing else in my professional capacity i am used to witnessing primal fear but i have never seen such widespread panic in my patient population as during the advent of sarscov2 as an oncologist i am also accustomed to framing danger in terms of proportions in the calculus of difficult judgments i try to demonstrate to my patients that the wellknown side effects of chemotherapy are worth hazarding presenting a risk–benefit ratio that i hope will not seem unacceptably topheavy when administering cytotoxic drugs i carry in my head a repository of percentages — a 37 chance of neutropenia with a certain combination regimen versus only a 13 chance when a single agent is deployed for instance — whereas my patients are understandably less empirical their choices often stem from their amygdala their fear center more than any other part of their brain and so theirs becomes a relative assessment of threats to their person in the ledger of horrors for them to proceed with myelosuppressive treatment their natural revulsion to “poison” must be superseded by their dread of an unopposed cancer every patients balance sheet looks different for some no chance of therapeutic benefit is too slim to lose its seductiveness still enticing even when hope for a positive outcome looks razorthin in my career i have been astonished at how many patients have been willing to accept nearly inevitable toxicity for the vanishingly small possibility that they will be one of a select few “exceptional responders” at least that is until now while the worldwide health community grapples with the novel contagion the starkest end point in the outbreak has been the rising tally of lives claimed by covid19 as the deaths have mounted it has also been common for the case fatality rate to be reported to the public i have seen many patients under my care struggle to process that grim fraction in the context of all the other statistics i already cite to them chemotherapy hardly desirable at the best of times may never have been less appealing although this pandemic poses danger in the most global sense certain subgroups appear particularly vulnerable to critical illness and death chinese investigators reported that patients with cancer affected by covid19 had a risk of the composite end point of invasive ventilation admission to the intensive care unit or death as high as five times that among patients without cancer1 even a remote history of cancer seemed to multiply the risk of severe events possibly owing to protracted immunodeficiency2 although that association may be correlative at best and the increased risk might be more closely tied to older age3 confounding factors notwithstanding most people with cancer in comparing themselves with their healthy peers perceive themselves as at greater risk from covid19 especially if they are actively undergoing therapy “are we still friends” is the halfjoking question i have long asked any patient to whom ive administered chemotherapy for the first time the initial treatment is instructive and clarifying for both of us in the era of shared decision making we commence treatment only after the hazy prophesying required for obtaining informed consent in which i deliver a litany of potential outcomes before advising patients that all things considered and in my professional medical opinion they ought to sign on the dotted line for all the gathering darkness the future looks bright how different things can seem at our next encounter ideally during a scheduled office visit but sometimes in the emergency department on the hospital ward or in the icu that laundry list of possibilities with which i deluged them at our previous appointment has now been narrowed distilled into a present reality that might include intractable nausea choleralike diarrhea or febrile neutropenia clouds have intruded on a sunny forecast and its time for the meteorologist to accept blame infection is not a new worry for the medical oncologist to consider in this dangerous balancing act between competing threats one of my most indelibly tragic memories from fellowship was the admission of a young mother during her first cycle of dosedense chemotherapy for breast cancer although she could not have looked more robust embarking on treatment and despite prophylactic myeloid growthfactor support her white cells plummeted to nearagranulocytosis and she became truly septic she was admitted in multiorgan system failure and rapidly died while on vasopressors and a ventilator despite every best effort i could not in the end rescue her at her nadir it still haunts me each time i prescribe chemotherapy the ethics lessons from my first year of medical school resound accusingly in my head primum non nocere to a student it seemed a selfevident easy morality and didnt i sound sophisticated saying it in latin but it turns out to be a precept thats extremely hard if not impossible for a medical oncologist to follow i am a blunt instrument and i cause collateral damage even when i take careful aim at an often elusive target inside a human being people including physicians do not often stop to think how exactly cancer kills they are aware of its often mortal ultimatum without considering the means to its ends it is rare for instance that the primary tumor grows so large that its size alone proves fatal although such a direct outcome is certainly possible in cases of for example a colon cancer obstructing the bowel more often the cause of death is the downstream derangement of physiology or the exquisite vulnerabilities of immunosuppression whether intrinsic or iatrogenic my queasy conscience now wrestles with the possibility of a bimodal peak of cancer patients dying the imminent spike of those with decimated immunity falling victim to covid19 and the latent toll on those whose treatments were deintensified delayed or canceled altogether to survive sarscov2 only to then succumb to an undertreated cancer would be a pyrrhic victory the acuteness of infection and the chronicity of malignancy are the scylla and charybdis between which oncologists and their patients must now chart a very cautious course indeed when i ask a patient who is undergoing chemotherapy whether we remain friends it is a feint toward an admission of guilt i recognize that our therapeutic alliance mirrors an abusive relationship i inflict injury i ask for forgiveness i try to reestablish trust and then i do it all over again we even number the chemo treatments in cycles reminding ourselves of times circularity the notsomerry merrygoround along another axis their course can be seen as a roller coaster a plunge into toxic effects an ascent back to baseline and then another precipitous decline i learn each patients pattern as i go and i try to counsel accordingly but will covid19 deepen the troughs to unfathomable lows only time will

nevertheless the continent is still on a trajectory to meet up with global regions more affected by covid19 fig 3 on seven may 2020 the who regional office for africa announced that according to its projections twentynine million to fortyfour million africans could become infected in the first year of the pandemic27 of these an estimated 36 million to 55 million would require hospitalization with 82000 to 167000 severe cases requiring oxygen and 52000 to 107000 critical cases requiring breathing support furthermore the overall estimated covid19 fatality ratio 06628 much lower than the current casefatality rates within africa 31 would indicate that as many as 470000 people on the continent would be infected with the causative coronavirus sarscov2 with a gap of 370000 cases missed due to insufficient testing together these estimates are a stark reminder that vigilance remains compulsory and that complacency cannot be allowed africa needs to intensify its efforts to slow the spread of the pandemic and lay the foundation for accelerated socioeconomic recovery to ensure an effective and comprehensive response to covid nineteen on the continent africa cdc calls for action on the following three core areas au member states must limit transmission through systematic and widespread surveillance and testing the testtraceisolatetreat strategy needs to be intensified to achieve the pact target of testing ten million africans within six months existing testing platforms for human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculosis should be leveraged and countries should aim to fasttrack the

africa cdc african health volunteers corps will be deployed in affected au member states surveillance for severe acute respiratory illnesses and influenzalike illness in healthcare facilities should also be enhanced29 ultimately these efforts will contribute to slowing transmission will help reduce hospitalizations and will avoid overwhelming of the healthcare system au member states must limit severe illness and death from covid19 countries must ensure sustained access to essential acutecare equipment and supplies in health facilities including triage protocols staff recruitment plans intensive care units oxygen ventilators and criticalcare medications forecasting28 is needed to inform efficient procurement and allocation of resources community outreach will be necessary to engage

salt lake city  thursday eleven june two thousand and twenty  thousands of reassigned missionaries of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints are heading out to new assignments in their home countries following disruptions due to the coronavirus pandemic|thousands of reassigned missionaries of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints are heading out to new assignments in their home countries following disruptions due to the coronavirus pandemic young missionaries across the world returned home from their international assignments in waves this spring when church leaders became concerned for their health and safety when the pandemic hit “we have moved about 26000 missionaries all of them to their home countries” said elder brent nielson a general authority seventy and executive director of the churchs missionary department church travel employees around the globe spent sleepless nights in their offices booking flights and chartering planes to bring the elders and sisters home many missionaries were not given much notice before having to pack their belongings and head to the nearest airport some left their missions without their luggage “this involved many weeks of very little sleep as we coordinated flights whether those be commercial or charter flights wherever the missionaries needed to go” said nanette sorensen global travel services manager for the churchs materials management department mmd “between our staff here and the staff in the area offices we saw miracles happen as borders opened up and we all worked together for this common good” “in addition to the sacrifice and the dedication it was amazing how unified we were as a team” said russell harrington missionary travel manager for global travel services who slept by his desk some nights while working to help bring all of the missionaries home “and if that took staying up for thirtysix hours and working at our desk the entire time we did it and everyone did it the unity that played into that was pretty phenomenal” thankyou notes from the families of missionaries and others hang in the travel office in the church office building in salt lake city in utah where many neighborhoods are predominantly latterday saint congregations organized driveby parades to welcome home the missionaries whose missions were cut short “i was so happy that made me feel so loved that was so sweet” expressed sister katie telford who returned to her south jordan home following fifteen months of service in the philippines those missionaries who had just a few months left to serve were released those with more time on their missions were given two options depart for new assignments as soon as possible or delay for twelve to eighteen months most missionaries opted to leave right away “that was a great moment for me to see how many of them wanted to go back” remarked elder nielson in the united states reassigned missionaries are going to nearly every mission in the country except “where the virus seems to be hot right now” according to elder nielson including locations such as new york and new jersey “every missionary whos assigned either to their permanent assignment or to a temporary assignment is made by a member of the quorum of the twelve apostles so theyve been very busy lately as they reassigned missionaries” said elder nielson there are many opportunities to serve but not enough apartments in some locations to house the influx of additional missionaries in highdemand areas such as the united states church housing staff contacted hotel chains to help solve the apartment shortage many of the hotel properties had available rooms as occupancy decreased when business and leisure travel dropped during the pandemic “we decided to reach out to hotels to see if they might be able to help us” said brent elliott a purchasing manager for mmd “and since there arent a lot of people traveling it was a good time to do that and so hotels reached out and theyre helping us” “it is a privilege for the materials management department to support the missionary department in helping our beloved missionaries” said peggy cowherd managing director of the materials management department “we are grateful for the wonderful collaboration with the missionary department the dedicated teamwork around the world and the countless miracles that have made all of this possible” when the churchs ten missionary training centers mtcs closed due to the pandemic several thousand newly called missionaries found themselves online in a virtual classroom the missionaries spend six hours a day online in a teleconference with a trainer and their class including about five hundred missionaries who are learning a new language “we teach them the same things we practice the same things with them and hopefully theyre just as prepared as the ones that come to the center” said bryce tripp an mtc instructor from mesa arizona brother tripp spends several weeks with each class of missionaries who are assigned to englishspeaking missions “as long as the missionaries are there to learn and the teacher is here to teach i think the same learning occurs” he said “i was worried the feeling would be different but its not” said maegan hendrix an mtc instructor who teaches missionaries going to mandarinspeaking missions “in regard to things like the language theres a lot more responsibility on them obviously to be practicing at home” elder nielson says the families of missionaries also benefit from virtual mtcs “i think weve learned some great lessons about the spirit that brings to a home when theres a child there whos actually studying how to be a missionary and learning a new language” sister sydney leiseth a mandarinspeaking missionary called to serve in the england leeds mission has enjoyed being with her family in herriman utah during her training “its been really cool to be able to share those experiences with them every single day as those experiences are happening” said sister leiseth who will begin her mission this summer in the florida tampa mission until it is safe to travel to england “theyve been so great about keeping the spirit in our home and following along with my mission protocols and the procedures that can help me be the best missionary here” sister leiseth and sister azoa price of midvale utah have both been in sister hendrixs mandarinspeaking virtual classroom “this is a really cool experience” shared sister price who will serve in the canada vancouver mission “i dont regret it and despite some of the hiccups that happened because of internet it works” sister price spends time with her mother practicing her chinese vocabulary “my mom is actually really cool shes willing to help me learn my language” most of the 4000 senior missionaries who are at higher risk for covid19 returned home a few did stay in the mission field and are in selfisolation “we have some that are serving from home” said elder nielson “they had an office assignment in their mission but they can still do it at home and well gradually begin to start having them go out if they can be safe” the missionary department reports that senior couples are still applying to serve missions “we still have some that are ready to go whenever we can send them” added elder nielson who said senior couples serving on a church farm can leave now “it just depends on what the assignment is … they can social distance they can wear masks and they can serve in an office” despite the pandemic fulltime missionaries are still teaching thousands of lessons every week from their apartments using technology they are also allowed to leave their apartments at certain times and provide meaningful community service in ways that are safe which includes wearing masks and social distancing around others two sisters who were serving in brazil have been reassigned to a portuguesespeaking congregation in salt lake city “i knew id be with brazilian people again i would be speaking portuguese and that would add this element of familiarity” said sister mauri dobbs a native of santa clarita california who served for a year in brazil “and here its so nice because we have smartphones and we can text people and … theres facebook that we can use” said her companion sister hannah davidson of sandpoint idaho “were learning new ways to do missionary work and i think people are actually more receptive online than they are with someone knocking on their door or trying to stop them on the street” said elder nielson “we teach from our home or sometimes we go to the church and teach but we can do it from the apartment just the same” said sister dobbs “we hear from almost every mission that they have a really long list of people who are waiting to be baptized as soon as the chapel can open” concluded elder nielson “were excited for that moment to happen and its starting to happen right now”|2020-06-11|0.9993|positive|0.217932951005381|positive

dublin must make an effort to work with the northern executive as lockdown eases|northern irelands health minister robin swann has criticised the government in dublin for its failure to keep the executive in belfast informed of its plan for easing lockdown restrictions he has a point this has been a recurring problem after first minister arlene foster complained rather justifiably that she and her colleagues had learned of the republics lockdown plans through the media and amidst concerns about the divergent approaches to the pandemic on both sides of the border the authorities in dublin and belfast were eager to show determination to coordinate better in april a memorandum of understanding was agreed between north and south which recognised a “compelling case for strong cooperation including informationsharing and where appropriate a common approach” when the government announced its accelerated roadmap last friday it said the executive was informed in advance but this appears to have been no more than a courtesy call the authorities in northern ireland made serious errors early on in the pandemic some such as the failure to carry out community testing and set up a contact tracing system were the result of a policy reliance on london whose approach to the pandemic has been muddled and chaotic but important strides have been made since then a rapprochement between foster and deputy first minister michelle oneill produced a useful model that reflected northern irelands own needs the compromise was that the dup accepted a plan closer to the republic than to britain while sinn féin accepted the principle of a bespoke plan for the north no deaths from coronavirus have been reported in the north in four days we are in a dangerous moment reopening society while the virus still circulates among us radically differing approaches north and south would leave everyone on the island more vulnerable if the government means what it says about the importance of crossborder coordination then it should make a genuine effort to work with the executive|2020-06-11|-0.7485|negative|0.07348484848484849|positive

central africa are now battling the covid19 pandemic the senior united nations official in the region told the security council during a twelve june videoconference meeting noting that 22000 cases of the virus have already been confirmed across eleven countries françois louncény fall special representative of the secretarygeneral and head of the united nations regional office for central africa unoca said covid19 has disrupted lives and the functioning of institutions across countries that already suffer a range of serious security and development challenges the first case of the virus was recorded on six march and since then members of the economic community of central african states eccas have been responding quickly the pandemic has also resulted in an economic crisis he said citing new projections that central africa is likely to experience a 23 per cent contraction in growth “the slowdown in economic activities due to covid19 deprives states of the resources they need to address the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic with the risk of creating social unrest” he warned governments are being forced to choose between urgent public health expenditures and other priorities such as the smooth functioning of institutions and the financing of reforms as central africas governments and regional instruments adapt to the new crisis context eccas is also pushing forward several crucial reforms recalling that the economic community held a highlevel meeting on three and four june he said ministers adopted a fourpronged regional response strategy to combat covid19 and its implications in central africa they spotlighted the need to prevent the spread of the virus limit the death rate and manage positive cases tackle the virus socioeconomic impact and respond to crossborder security issues resulting from the pandemic unoca continues to mobilize the relevant united nations entities to support eccas as it evolves drawing attention to the creation of a new unocaeccas working group he cited two virtual meetings with united nations resident coordinators to ensure their countrylevel coordination with regional initiatives he noted that states across the subregion have worked to limit the pandemics impact on economic and social rights assisting businesses and vulnerable populations and responding to calls from the united nations high commissioner for human rights for the decongestion of prisons noting that some of the restrictive measures imposed to combat covid19 have been viewed as impediments to the exercise of fundamental freedoms he urged countries to ensure that law enforcement agents apply restrictions carefully and proportionately and to abide by human rights principles and standards “the persistence of armed conflicts in some parts of central africa undermines our efforts to respond to challenges posed by covid19” he said despite the secretarygenerals appeal for a global ceasefire amid the pandemic conflicts continue and terrorists and armed groups are destabilizing the subregion in that vein he welcomed the launch by cameroon and chad of “operation wrath of boma” to fight terrorism in the lake chad basin which seems to have weakened boko haram however experience shows that the group can only be eradicated through a wellcoordinated strategy combining both military and nonmilitary approaches tackling root drivers of conflict and strengthening the multinational joint task force noting that the lords resistance army has also been weakened he said the group nevertheless continues to kill loot and abduct civilians and children regional actors and their international partners should strengthen their cooperation and mobilize the resources against it meanwhile central african states continue to grapple with other major challenges — including the impacts of climate change and the mounting threat of maritime insecurity in the gulf of guinea — all while trying to improve good governance and respond to challenging internal situations for example several countries have launched legal proceedings against prominent persons accused of embezzling public resources turning to cameroon he said three military officers have now been charged with murder following their involvement in a february attack on the village of ngarbuh an independent commission of inquiry has also been called for in the death of the journalist samuel ajiekah abuwe outlining progress in implementing the recommendations of cameroons two thousand and nineteen national dialogue he spotlighted initiatives to reconstruct and develop the countrys northwest and southwest while calling for the protection of civilians and more dialogue meanwhile in the democratic republic of the congo steps are needed to build confidence in the dialogue platforms set out in the constitution following the briefing the representative of france council president for june said in his national capacity that central africa remains fragile despite some progress spotlighting the central african republics volatile situation he said its peace agreement is being threatened by armed groups and the preelection period is fuelling tensions the lake chad basin faces the persistent threat of boko haram and the gulf of guinea remains the epicentre of global piracy those situations are even more delicate against the backdrop of covid19 he stressed noting that france has pledged €12 billion to support africas fight against the virus advocated for a moratorium on debt servicing and is contributing to a humanitarian “air bridge” between europe and african countries the russian federations delegate expressed support for unocas good offices preventive diplomacy and other activities which are in high demand across the subregion welcoming timely measures taken by central african countries to curb the spread of covid19 and finalize eccas reforms he spotlighted political developments in the central african republic welcoming president faustinarchange touadéras efforts to stabilize the situation and promote reconciliation noting that the conflict in cameroons anglophone provinces has deep historical roots and can only be resolved at the negotiating table he urged all cameroonian parties to exercise maximum restraint and abandon violence the representative of the dominican republic also drew attention to security challenges and human rights violations in cameroon expressing hope that those responsible for the death of the journalist samuel wazizi will be brought to justice “it is highly important that the cameroonian authorities can ensure that national and international human rights organizations and the media can work in the country unhindered” he said also spotlighting the impacts of attacks by boko haram and the lords resistance army sexual violence and climate change he noted that severe floods have caused displacement and exacerbated the challenges of the covid19 response he welcomed that mitigating those adverse effects remains a priority for unoca estonias representative echoed concerns about covid19 as well as existing threats to regional peace and security in central africa “targeting civilians and taking advantage of the pandemic by intensifying attacks is especially deplorable” he stressed also condemning attacks against humanitarian and medical personnel he welcomed steps taken by the government of cameroon to implement the recommendations of the national dialogue however the countrys deteriorating humanitarian situation and reports of human rights abuses committed against women and children remain a source of concern voicing support for unocas efforts to support cameroons political momentum he also expressed hope that political strides will be promptly translated into security and human rights improvements the representative of the united kingdom called on countries to work together to mitigate the spread of covid19 in ways that will strengthen and not undermine peace and security echoing the secretarygenerals call for an end to all attacks on civilians he urged united nations agencies to scale up their rapid response mechanisms with an increased focus on genderbased violence he also encouraged cameroons international partners — including the african union unoca and the peacebuilding commission — to support efforts to restore peace stressing the importance of regional cooperation through the multinational joint task force in the lake chad basin he also reiterated the importance of preserving a peaceful climate in burundi during its current period of transition also participating were the representatives of belgium china germany tunisia also on behalf of niger saint vincent and the grenadines and south africa united states and viet nam

social distancing and slowing down the spread of covid19 yet such measures are often blamed for downturns in the economy this column argues that the lockdowns in the us are in fact efficient in minimising the costs of the epidemic once both the economic and medical burden that would arise in the absence of such policies are considered estimates from a controlled sir model which includes the possibility for changes in behaviour suggest that lockdowns reduce the costs of the pandemic by at least 17 of annual gdp compared to a nolockdown scenario with few exceptions governments around the world have implemented lockdown policies in order to combat the covid19 pandemic public debates over the costs of such measures have typically assumed that the extent to which populations socially distance and the associated economic costs are mostly within the governments control what is largely missing in these debates however is the recognition that the economic costs of the pandemic will be substantial even in the absence of lockdowns since the spread of the virus causes a significant increase in voluntary social distancing chudik et al 2020 brzezinski et al 2020a this suggests that the counterfactual additional costs of a lockdown might be lower than commonly assumed indeed in a recent paper brzezinski et al 2020b we find that lockdown policies have been economically more efficient than staying open in the us to obtain these results we combine microeconometric methods with an epidemiological model that allows for societal and political response to the virus in order to estimate the costs and benefits of lockdown policies our argument builds on two pillars • first we find that the additional economic costs due to lockdowns are relatively low once accounting for the voluntary response that would occur in the absence of such policies this is in line with forecasts for 2020 which predict similar contractions in most developed countries european commission 2020 even if they did not impose lockdown measures like sweden it also aligns with earlier research that showed credit card consumption only marginally less in sweden than in neighbouring denmark which did lock down andersen et al 2020 research on unemployment data from the us further suggests that only one fourth of the claims has been caused by lockdowns baek et al 2020 • second the medical benefits of a lockdown are high because of the high hospitalisation rate of covid19 taken together our findings indicate that lockdown measures generate efficiency gains in terms of medical expenditures that offset the comparatively small economic losses caused by lockdown policies we leverage daily countylevel mobile phone data on movement patterns to study the impact of local outbreaks and lockdown policies on mobility these data are considered crucial in mitigating the spread of covid19 oliver et al 2020 and have been used in a wide range of applications allcott et al 2020 andersen 2020 our events of interest are the first countylevel case and statelevel stayathome orders issued over the course of march and april 2020 these allow us to estimate the voluntary and lockdown responses to an outbreak respectively1 due to the gradual occurrence of these events across the us we are able to construct viable counterfactual scenarios using differenceindifferences designs our outcome variable of interest is the percentage of devices that stay home all day figure one shows the estimated uptake in social distancing following the first covid19 case by state the horizontal line indicates the estimated coefficient for the us as a whole while the points correspond to statespecific estimates overall the share of people that stayed home all day increased by around 18 percentage points in the us this constitutes an increase of 51 compared to february 2020 as reduced mobility maps into lower economic activity this implies that economic costs are inevitable even in the absence of lockdown measures notes the figure plots the differenceindifferences estimate for the change in the percentage of devices that stay completely at home following the first case in a county blue red lines correspond to democratic republican states as per the two thousand and sixteen presidential election dashed lines indicate parameters that are insignificant at p005 confidence level 95 this substantial uptake in social distancing is comparable in magnitude to citizens response to lockdown orders using a similar approach our results show that the additional lockdowninduced impact on social distancing is 53 thus governments that rely solely on voluntary social distancing need to take into account that the behavioural change will be significantly smaller without a lockdown policy in place but will nonetheless still lead to sizeable decreases in activity how do these patterns in social distancing map into medical and economic costs we answer this question by studying a controlled sir model gros et al 2020 the acronym stands for susceptible – infected – recovered in addition to the standard epidemiological sir model this framework introduces the possibility for changes in behaviour such as social distancing which influence the rate at which the virus reproduces this additional parameter can be interpreted as the joint social and political effort to promote social distancing and therefore to mitigate the spread of the virus in the context of the covid19 pandemic the model allows us to split the reaction strength into the components related to voluntary and mandated social distancing then based on the previously estimated coefficients we simulate the outbreak for both a lockdown and a nolockdown scenario based on these simulations we separately estimate the economic and medical costs arising from the pandemic the medical costs are composed of the production loss due to infected workers going on sick leave and the medical expenses associated with infections these costs are directly proportional to the number of infections over the course of the pandemic2 the economic costs depend negatively on the degree of social distancing which can be measured by the relative decrease in the reproduction number overall the model reflects the tradeoff faced by governments between balancing medical and economic costs lessrestrictive policies increase medical costs through the total number of infected individuals while lowering the burden from reduced economic activity the medical and economic cost estimates are presented in figure two for a selection of us states that imposed lockdowns it shows the costs in terms of gdp per capita associated with the estimated total containment response t and the counterfactual voluntary response v3 for the us as a whole we estimate that covid19 generates costs of around 139 of annual gdp per capita under a laissezfaire scenario compared to 122 if a lockdown is imposed4 in other words imposing a countrywide lockdown would reduce the loss incurred by as much as 17 over the course of the pandemic compared to a nolockdown scenario the finding that lockdowns are efficient in lowering the overall costs holds consistently across all states considered5 decreasing the measured containment response by lifting a lockdown would only marginally increase the economic costs while at the same time drastically increasing the medical costs this pattern is more pronounced in states where the overall containment response was insufficiently effective such as new york delaware and massachusetts in these states voluntary social distancing leads to relatively larger decreases in economic costs compared to states with more efficient containment responses such as vermont and new mexico yet the small reductions in economic activity are more than outweighed by the much larger relative increases in medical costs notes the figure shows estimated costs under voluntary social distancing v compared to total social distancing t – which includes voluntary v and lockdowninduced reductions l in movement estimated costs for t are based on simulations of the discretized csir model costs for v are reestimated with α scaled by the estimated ratio vvl  vt costs are in terms of gdp per capita costs for both v and t are broken down into economic red and medical blue we provide evidence for the efficiency of lockdown policies in mitigating both the overall costs to the economy as well as the spread of covid19 the reason for this is that individuals engage in voluntary social distancing even in the absence of lockdowns once the virus takes hold in their area hence substantial economic costs are unavoidable even when not locking down yet the additional lockdowninduced social distancing plays an important role in preventing further medical costs indeed for our estimates of the voluntary and mandated social distancing responses all us states that imposed a lockdown would have incurred larger overall costs had they stayed open considering the correct counterfactual costs is therefore key in informing policy decisions during potential future waves of covid19 allcott h l boxell j

john tregoning ponders a staged reopening of his lab on campus|after my grant application was rejected i needed something to cheer me up i found it in three crucial words in the ‘going to work section of the uk governments catchily titled document ‘staying alert and safe social distancing published on eleven may the words in question were “and scientific research” they signalled the phased lifting of some aspects of lockdown in england specifically they paved the way for a limited return to work for scientists who work in wet laboratories and cannot work from home the priority for reopening the laboratory is ensuring that it is safe for everyone my lab is lucky to have experience in assessing the risk of infection from viral pathogens because we work with them routinely — admittedly from a safety cabinet and in full personal protective equipment importantly each persons final decision on whether to go into the lab is down to that individual and no one is under any pressure to return the riskiest part of reopening isnt found in the lab at all it is the use of public transport where people are in much closer contact to get to the lab coronavirus and covid19 keep up to date im excited about the prospect of the lab reopening even at reduced capacity i would very much like to return to doing new science now we have exciting questions that i want to answer does sophies vaccine work will emilys wonderdrug kill all microbes will davids dna do the deal is katies rna stable and there are numerous side projects and collaborations that if i had some time i could restart however not every research scientist across the country will be able to come back immediately for parents and caregivers in the united kingdom until schools and nurseries reopen for all children it is going to be extremely difficult to physically return to work getting labs up and running again will not be immediate especially for those that were completely shuttered experiments take time to coax back to life in this respect my group is in a slightly different situation because we are not returning to an empty lab we share space with robin shattock an immunologist at imperial college london and his amazing team who have been leading the charge on one of the united kingdoms covid19 vaccine candidates people have been in the lab continually working at a sensible safe distance from each other on the two occasions that i have been back the lab looked more or less the same as it did before even more importantly charlie in the moleculardiagnostics lab has between developing and running covid19 detection tests coaxed my lemon tree back to life what does reopening more of the lab mean for me personally as someone who didnt spend a significant proportion of their time in the lab it will not lead to much change i can do most of my job from home so am condemned to do so it certainly doesnt mean an instant return to pre2020 work practices as evidenced by the fact that i wrote the first draft of this from my allotment while loosely childminding and not from my office at imperial while loosely supervising getting back to normal will be a very long process for those of you returning imminently i can share some of my experiences of the limited return to work i have made on the occasions ive returned to the lab one of the things i have noticed is anxiety it is like the beginning of the school year after a long summer holiday will i still know what i am doing will people still like me will i still like them will i remember not to call the teacher mummy the easiest way around this anxiety is to jump straight in and get to grips with the matter in hand being busy is one of the best ways to stop overthinking if need be do a small simple experiment just to blow away the cobwebs of imposter syndrome the reopening of some lab activity does mean that in the united kingdom we are moving to a different phase we are in the end of the beginning i am not a modeller so i have no inkling of where this path leads us there is the distinct possibility that infections will rise again and we will enter a second cycle of lockdown i need to manage my own expectations as much as my teams that no sooner than picking them up we might have to down our pipettes again|2020-06-12|0.9932|positive|0.12022551386521976|positive

beyond its human toll covid19 has wrought upon us a daunting economic toll in a matter of just two weeks in midmarch 2020 entire industries and sectors were brought to an abrupt halt in the uk for instance car manufacturing fell from more than 70000 …|prudent accounting balances the forces that drive a business to be efficient and resilient by helping a company stay asset light and forcing it to write off dud projects as their losses become apparent even in otherwise good times such a company is thus less likely to throw good money after bad lowering waste in the company and in the economy and when bad times hit the company is less prone to be carrying unwanted costs a huge relief for everyone including the taxpayer likewise when a prudent company raises debt it does so despite the downward bias in its accounts — so that debt is safer in that it sits on a more conservative cushion this makes the company and its creditor less likely to fail when a crisis hits and finally by being prudent in good times the company has recognized losses earlier and attenuated the scale of its dividend and bonus payouts this means theres more of buffer in retained capital to weather it through a crisis beyond its human toll covid19 has wrought upon us a daunting economic toll in a matter of just two weeks in midmarch 2020 entire industries and sectors were brought to an abrupt halt in the uk for instance car manufacturing fell from more than 70000 cars in april two thousand and nineteen to just one hundred and ninetyseven cars in april 2020 for further contrast the uk made more than 120000 units during february 2020 to survive a crisis like this a business must be both efficient and resilient prudent accounting — the commonsense accounting concept that there should be a higher threshold to recognizing anticipated gains relative to recognizing anticipated losses — had for generations helped businesses balance these two pulls in turn businesses were better prepared for an unpredictable blow then at about the turn of the 21st century accounting rulemakers did away with prudence we are living the consequence today the economy is teeming with crappy balancesheets that necessitate gargantuan bailouts when crises hit now concerned about anemic bank lending to industrial companies regulators have further curtailed prudence the fed recently eased a key accounting restriction that encouraged more responsible lending and ensured that banks had a robust cushion against crisisinduced losses in the uk the central bank is so alarmed by weak lending to corporations that it is urging financial institutions not to book big charges on potentially souring loans these practices constitute the opposite of prudence a financial crisis like our current one was not unimaginable it has only been slightly more than a decade since the world last experienced a sudden shock to global industrial solvency and the idea that such a shock could come from disease was made very real by the nearmiss ebola and zika outbreaks of two thousand and fourteen and 2016 so the real question is how do we avoid finding ourselves here again when we face the next major economic shock one answer is to bring “prudence” back to corporate accounting resilience is the ability to withstand and recover from negative shocks resilience is slack — the capacity to absorb failure and continue onward you are not resilient if youve continued to hold on to that lossmaking division instead of shutting it down you are also not resilient if you have underused debt in growing your business because it likely means you have not diversified to a level where you can now afford a few failures efficiency simply means greater output and lesser waste for a given quantity of input efficient organizations are asset light and more leveraged relative to peers — features that seemingly make them less resilient they appear to have fewer reserves to draw on when the rains fail but being asset light really means you are carrying less excess baggage when you need to move quickly it does not mean that you have shed yourself of the essential baggage companies like wouldbe dieters often get this wrong in their quest to being lean similarly being more leveraged than your peers means you can do more with less capital which can be hugely advantageous when capital is scarce as during a crisis the key is to assume only as much leverage as you need to operate at efficient scale and scope and not to assume leverage to pay out dividends or bonuses as several banks did before the last financial crisis prudent accounting balances the forces that drive a business to be efficient and resilient by helping a company stay asset light and forcing it to write off dud projects as their losses become apparent even in otherwise good times such a company is thus less likely to throw good money after bad lowering waste in the company and in the economy and when bad times hit the company is less prone to be carrying unwanted costs a huge relief for everyone including the taxpayer likewise when a prudent company raises debt it does so despite the downward bias in its accounts — so that debt is safer in that it sits on a more conservative cushion this makes the company and its creditor less likely to fail when a crisis hits and finally by being prudent in good times the company has recognized losses earlier and attenuated the scale of its dividend and bonus payouts this means theres more of buffer in retained capital to weather it through a crisis prudence is both a regulatory principle and a managerial state of mind to bring back prudence into accounting thus requires two layers of action first the us securities  exchange commission and its equivalents worldwide should mandate that any new accounting standards — and indeed any accounting standards issued since about two thousand — meet the prudence test put differently those standards should require objective evidence before companies can book gains or avoid losses on the basis of expected future profits second boards and auditors should exercise greater skepticism when approving ceo and cfo judgments on highly discretionary items such as capitalizing intangibles and avoiding goodwill chargeoffs in anticipating such pushback senior management will then impose their own higher standards in making these decisions resulting in higher quality balancesheets prudence in accounting practice has been around since at least the 1400s and by the late 19th century and the advent of modern capitalism it was already a welldeveloped and widely regarded principle we foolishly abandoned this history quite recently but two major financial crises and trillions in bailouts later we must reclaim

researchers fear that breakthroughs from abroad will be too slow or inequitably shared to benefit the global south|gustavo cabral de miranda is used to people doubting him as a child he often had to put his schoolwork on hold to help his family selling ice cream and mangoes at fairs or working at a butchers shop in bahia in northeastern brazil by the time he decided at twentytwo years old to stop this work and study to become a scientist others were telling him that academic life would not suit him “it wasnt for people like me” he remembers them saying now cabral an immunologist at the university of são paulo is one of a number of ambitious latin american scientists who are forging ahead with vaccine research programmes to fight covid19 right now there is no vaccine for the coronavirus that causes the disease a select group of candidates most of them supported by pharmaceutical companies in china the united states and europe have entered trials in humans but researchers such as cabral want a backup plan in case these wellresourced front runners are not successful or hoarding or international dealmaking prevents them from reaching low and middleincome countries their goals echo longstanding efforts throughout latin america to capitalize on national knowledge and establish — or reestablish — scientific independence from overseas pharmaceutical companies on the front lines of the coronavirusvaccine battle as latin america becomes the new epicentre of covid19 concerns are flaring about the prospect of relying on a vaccine developed and manufactured elsewhere especially given that rich countries have had better access to vaccines in the past1 “weve already seen some monopoly behaviour even though we dont have a covid19 vaccine yet” says gavin yamey a globalhealth researcher at duke university in durham north carolina some governments of highincome countries have reportedly tried to buy vaccinemanufacturing companies or acquire a percentage of their supply “the only ones who are going to solve the problems in latin america are going to be us latin americans no ones coming to rescue us” says maría elena bottazzi a honduran microbiologist at baylor college of medicine in houston texas whos developing a covid19 vaccine that she plans to distribute throughout the region by partnering with local vaccineproducing hubs such as mexico brazil and argentina some groups are working on ensuring equitable access but billions of doses will be needed worldwide and no single provider can supply that amount says fernando lobos a director at sinergium biotech a vaccine maker in buenos aires instead of waiting to see what happens researchers across latin america are working to find their own way out of the pandemic “it does not matter if we start with less funds but rather that we start” says cabral cabral returned to brazil in november 2019 after five years in europe learning about new vaccine technologies he was working on vaccines against the bacterium streptococcus pyogenes and the chikungunya virus which both cause a lot of illness in brazil – when covid19 began spreading rapidly across the globe “i had to quickly adapt the project” he says his team uses harmless hollow viruslike particles created in the lab the researchers stud the surfaces of these particles with fragments of the proteins that the coronavirus uses to enter human cells the idea is to trick the immune system into producing antibodies that would block the coronavirus during an infection because these particles cant replicate inside the human body theyre considered safer than vaccines made from weakened viruses and the technology has been used to create commercially available vaccines for hepatitis b and human papillomavirus cabrals group is starting animal testing and some other covid19 vaccine candidates in preclinical evaluation are following a similar approach cabral thinks brazil would be able to produce a safe and effective vaccine on a large scale and distribute it throughout the nation and to neighbouring countries the country is one of the largest vaccine producers in latin america over the past several decades it has introduced improved technologies trained pioneering scientists and developed the most diverse vaccine portfolio in the region — even exporting to other nations luciana leite a vaccinologist at the butantan institute in são paulo says that innovation is key the world will need alternatives if vaccine candidates using conventional approaches fail “if you have an idea thats different from whats out there i think its worthwhile contributing with that” she says if a coronavirus vaccine arrives can the world make enough her own approach is based on a property of some bacteria that release tiny bubbles or vesicles from their membranes to mislead a hosts immune system researchers have tried to harness these vesicles to carry viral proteins — antigens that the immune system can recognize and make antibodies against — mixing them together to trigger a response in asyet unpublished research leite and her students have found a way to attach large amounts of antigens to the bubbles inducing a strongerthanusual immune response they are now using the same technique with proteins from the coronavirus sarscov2 cabral hopes that all these efforts will showbrazilians that the government should invest more in research which has been hit by budget cuts in recent years sparking an exodus of young scientists the covid19 pandemic is the right moment he says “this is the best time to open our eyes” cabral says “when the dust settles priorities change” a few weeks ago laura palomares reached out to a colleague for help with a covid19 vaccine she is developing using viruslike particles palomares a biotechnologist at the national autonomous university of mexico in cuernavaca was shocked by his response “he says ‘laura all right im going to help you but i dont know why youre wasting your time doing this” why bother creating a vaccine when the first successful vaccines will come from abroad she remembers him asking its an argument she has heard many times — but it ignores mexicos history of vaccine production for about four decades mexico manufactured most of the vaccines needed for its national immunization programme but the government dismantled the institutes responsible for producing vaccines and in the late 1990s replaced them with birmex a stateowned company since then national vaccine production has plummeted now palomares says mexico produces only two vaccines against influenza and hepatitis b if her vaccine works against sarscov2 she might be able to partner with birmex to get it produced palomares hopes that manufacturing a domestically developed covid19 vaccine will push the company to resume the production of other vaccines needed for the national immunization programme but another option might be seeking help from abroad says josé manuel aguilar a biotechnologist at the monterrey institute of technology and higher education in mexico he and his colleagues have already contacted a canadian company that could manufacture enough doses for them to start evaluating their own vaccine in humans once they finish animal testing what a us exit from the who means for covid19 and global health their vaccine uses rings of dna called nanoplasmids which are taken up by cells the dna encodes a specific region of the protein that sarscov2 uses to infect a host this allows the cells to produce the antigen and display it on their surface alerting the hosts immune system aguilar says that if the groups clinical results are promising and if the researchers can find enough funds they could ramp up production in three months to fabricate millions of doses “we could put mexico in the vaccine race” he says in the 1960s chile developed a vaccine that soon became key to controlling rabies throughout latin america since then however the country has lost its production capacity today “all human vaccines used in chile are obtained from foreign laboratories” says alexis kalergis an immunologist at the pontifical catholic university of chile in santiago but that hasnt stopped chilean researchers from trying to tame other viral diseases kalergis himself has become well known since he and his team developed a vaccine candidate that might one day protect newborn babies against the respiratory syncytial virus a major cause of pneumonia and bronchitis in young children coronavirus vaccine trials have delivered their first results — but their promise is still unclear now his laboratory is rushing to create four prototype vaccines against sarscov2 using protein fragments genetic material and live but harmless bacteria that can express some of the coronaviruss components if everything goes to plan studies in humans could begin as soon as next year and if any of his prototypes shows promise kalergis says he will reach out to vaccineproducing companies outside chile to help manufacture it “our plan is to distribute this vaccine against sarscov2 to all countries that need it” he says “but with emphasis in our region” a visit to the vet in peru as cases of the new coronavirus disease climbed in china in early january mirko zimic had a hunch “i had a very strong suspicion that it would cross borders and affect many nations in particular peru” he says zimic a biophysicist at cayetano heredia university in lima had worked on vaccines for use in chickens and pigs he called colleagues at farvet a veterinary pharmaceutical company in chincha and proposed that they work together on something neither had done before making a human vaccine the researchers used insect cells to manufacture coronavirus spike proteins to provoke an immune response zimic and his colleagues will inject these into mice to test them but theres an issue if those tests are successful|2020-06-12|0.9955|positive|0.13291525974025967|positive
military leaders share their experience in making critical decisions during a time of crisis|the challenge of navigating a vast publichealth and economic crisis shares some important parallels with leadership during military conflicts in this episode of the inside the strategy room podcast mckinsey senior partner yuval atsmon talks with three top us air force and navy leaders about what corporate executives can learn from the practices of military commanders michael b donley served as the 22nd secretary of the us air force he has thirty years of experience in the national security community including service on the staffs of the united states senate white house and pentagon c robert kehler is a retired us air force general who served as commander of the us strategic command and of air force space command among other positions eric olson is a retired us navy admiral who headed the us special operations command he is also the first navy seal to be appointed to threestar and fourstar flag rank yuval atsmon—himself a former tank commander—is a coauthor of the recent article “lessons from the generals decisive action amid the chaos of crisis” this is an edited transcript for more conversations on the strategy issues that matter subscribe to the series on apple podcasts or google play yuval atsmon the coronavirus is a major global crisis that has imposed lockdowns on many communities it threatens our lives and our economies a double front thats moving rapidly the three of you know better than most about how to take decisive action in a crisis but let me first ask you do you think the analogy with war is apt c robert kehler well we have used the wartime analogy for other major publicpolicy issues the war on crime the war on drugs the war on poverty i think there are many features of the covid19 crisis that lend themselves to this analogy as well the demands it places on leaders are very much like wartime demands in terms of the need to articulate objectives and priorities and rally the public behind them certainly this requires major national and intelligence organization it requires planning and mobilization it requires communication and innovation a commitment of resources—all the same kinds of things you would talk about during war it is also warlike in the need for allies for maybe the first time the entire world needs to be viewed as an ally in this crisis on the other hand there are significant differences between a war and a global pandemic maybe most important a war is a clash between human beings and this enemy does not react in a human way it has no fear it has no passion factors that influence a human enemy have no effect on covid19 it doesnt get deterred by anything we do and it is not going to surrender secondly all the sacrifice is on the human side everybody is at risk there is no sanctuary so covid19 will have to be defeated in the laboratory before it can be defeated in the field and that may take a very long time which requires patience that will be difficult for our leaders to keep insisting on—especially since there likely wont be any psychological equivalent of victory eric olson i think bob is fundamentally right there are features that make the comparison to war appropriate the difference is that the weapon against this enemy is science and its success will depend on how policy makers use the data that scientists provide this enemy is more predictable it can change and morph of course but it cannot consciously adapt its strategies based on our actions and as bob said this is not about geopolitical advantage the whole world is facing the same threat there is a challenge and an opportunity in that and then almost unique for us as americans is that we are fighting this on our home front michael b donley i would focus on the similarities from the csuite perspective the ceo in this context is very much like a commander and the csuite staff are like the headquarters staff in a military in the military many teams support frontline fighters here we are reminded of what is critical infrastructure in a publichealth crisis were not only thinking about health and safety issues but also building maintenance food service it teamwork across the full capabilities of a corporate staff is vital to keeping the leadership team informed to formulate and execute decisions and you need to use all of the tools in the toolbox i used to use a golf analogy you dont leave any club unused yuval atsmon in terms of the similarity between commanders and executives im hearing from many clients that this is the first time they are facing a crisis where theyre responsible for workforces that are scared about both the immediate health risks and the economic risk what military practices would apply to this situation eric olson former secretary of defense donald rumsfeld used to talk about the knowns the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns i think we are in the realm of the unknown unknowns it requires a different kind of leader this goes beyond uncertainty and into ambiguity leaders have to accept more risk because they must make decisions with less knowledge there is no doctrine or master plan that applies to this it is very important that leaders communicate clearly and authentically they will have to be more comfortable with flattened organizations but delegating effectively and leading a more empowered organization requires a level of trust that may not exist in many organizations now leaders also have to be more tolerant of mistakes that will inevitably occur amid a lack of knowledge and they will have to apply more imagination in problem solving the solutions to this crisis will be outside of most leaders experience so leaders will need to have bigger ears to hear more—and more diverse—approaches michael b donley keeping communications open across the csuite staff is obviously vital there needs to be a battle rhythm if you will that keeps a full flow of information coming into the leadership an assessment process that the ceo leads and the development of options for the way forward but on the health and safety aspects some corporations have had to call in outside help it is a reminder that sometimes you dont have all the expertise you need on your staff and when you dont have it you need to find it c robert kehler there is an old saying in the us air force flexibility is the key to air and space power i think that applies here leaders have to be flexible in much more uncomfortable ways than they have ever had to be in the past and i would pick up on erics point about delegating you have to be uncomfortable in the amount of delegation that you are willing to do also of critical importance for leaders is being able to set a direction and then adjust we have another saying in the us military our members act with disciplined initiative commanders transmit what we call “commanders intent” and then rely on their people to make the right judgments based on the information they have thats not always something executives are comfortable doing but it is critically important now eric olson an old mentor of mine used to say “when the map differs from the terrain youve got to go with the terrain” that makes many corporate leaders uncomfortable they like to have guidance but there is just a lack of guidance here people will have to adjust to the terrain as they walk it yuval atsmon you all mentioned the need for empowerment and the ability to respond to new information one emphasis embedded in mckinsey by our early managing director marvin bower is to help our clients make factbased decisions military organizations are good at doing that even during very intense times whereas companies even during relaxed times do not always consider all the facts how do you make sure you have the right information michael b donley part of this challenge is the necessity of making decisions without complete information facts change things become clearer some things become less clear but you put yourself in an iterative decisionmaking process in which you can make course corrections in an incremental way eric olson absolutely there has to be recognition up front that the facts are only facts for a while we are learning more every day and that alters what we believed to be facts about the coronavirus one idea i have seen used with some success is crowdsourcing your network of experts to verify observations and help determine which facts are more real than others a doctor sees something in a patient and goes online to say “has anybody else seen this” this has been very helpful in sorting some of the facts from the rumors yuval atsmon we are also seeing collaboration in the medical community between not just academics and companies but also competitors to form consortia that can bring solutions quickly which is an example of the type of crowdsourcing you are talking about c robert kehler csuites face an interesting dilemma they are accustomed to operating in a highly competitive environment and yet success in this environment is going to depend on sharing there will still be a tension between a companys need to be competitive and its need to share information we face a similar tension in the military with the need to protect classified information but have everybody sufficiently informed to be successful on the battlefield ceos and corporate leaders will have to be comfortable with getting information from different sources than before and sharing their information in return the other tension is between ambiguity and risk military commanders deal with those two factors constantly you never have perfect information and you can never eliminate risk you can operate with the information you have you can seek more and you can manage risk but you can never eliminate it military commanders eventually accept that this is

consumergoods companies in asian emerging markets are turning to data analytics and digital solutions to realize value in traditional trade|in emerging asia independent grocery stores remain not only a vital channel for consumerpackagedgoods cpg companies but also for the economy supporting millions of households given the scale and proximity of these stores to endconsumers and despite the inefficiencies emerging from a fragmented system manufacturers must continue crafting approaches to reach these stores while reacting to intermediary systems that are becoming increasingly digitized in 2017 nielsen reported more than thirteen million small grocers in four asian countries—india china indonesia and the philippines—with india alone hosting a staggering 66 million exhibit 1 the number of small grocers in the region has continued to grow over the past decade albeit at a much slower pace than the overall consumer food market while modern retail formats are gaining market share in emerging asian economies a fragmented market system is likely to remain convenient and hence competitive as long as these small shops continue to serve their shoppers needs the covid19 pandemic will likely impact these trends for instance pushing more consumers to modern online channels and creating shortterm supplychain problems but the role small shops play in local commerce and social networks assures they will remain relevant even after the crisis passes while traditional retail environments continue to offer benefits inefficiencies along the value chain are likely to trigger a digitalled disruption that large packagedgoods companies should track and indeed plan to benefit from there are inherent complexities stemming from multiple small intermediaries servicing the same routes and the same retailers often making runs with trucks only partially loaded the system also leans toward manual processes which are slower and more prone to inconsistency and inefficiency compared to digital and automated processes in addition some small outlets are cash constrained rely on credit and are limited in the assortment they can offer compared to the expansive selection at modern retail stores leading to shopper shift a fragmented route to market also has had an inflexible supply chain everything from sales plans to delivery routes is difficult to alter dynamically and even large companies change their plans only once or twice a year leaving no room for agile reallocation of resources depending on the maturity of modern retail outlets in a specific market small shops can also burden consumergoods companies with higher costs to serve in addition consumergoods companies are hard pressed to use their own digital capabilities to analyze and improve sales at small outlets while valuable data is available to these companies it requires consistency transparency and atscale investment in advancedanalytics capabilities as an illustration some distributors offer outletlevel information and others dont these challenges make it hard if not impossible for companies to produce clear realtime insights on market trends that can inform their strategy improving the efficiency of traditional trade in emerging markets also helps preserve the smallshop culture it constitutes an essential element of local livelihoods provides employment maintains a social hub for communities and can be a valuable source of knowledge about micromarkets while the disruptions brought by technology can address inefficiencies they can also help small trade outlets thrive a preview of whats ahead for smaller emerging asian markets can be seen in china empowered by alibabas ling shou tong lst platform small shops and their suppliers are using data analytics and digital solutions in the following ways • accelerate the shift to digital models and remote interactions a move made more urgent by the covid19 pandemic • aggregate orders creating lower costs to serve for individual consumergoods manufacturers and as a result allowing lower prices at outlets • provide convenience in ordering stock reducing the chances of items being out of stock • increase transparency into the flow of goods allowing suppliers to be more active in these traditional channels for instance by using targeted promotions companies in india are also experimenting with disruptive digitization the b2b trading platform udaan for example is linking the wholesaledominant distribution system by connecting sellers and buyers jio is building a “new commerce” platform that offers pointofsale pos billing services digitized inventory control digitized order placement among other benefits and jio platforms has recently seen an investment of about 12 billion from facebook and private equity companies across china india and some economies in southeast asia a pattern of solutions emerges driven by entrepreneurs and ecosystems the services are typically anchored on four elements with various levels of valueadd services on top a digital ordering application connecting retailers and suppliers a logistics offering to increase reach and reduce cost to serve digitized pos systems to improve data collection and usage and finally a consumer interface to reach and retain shoppers exhibit 2 while china and india are among the leaders in digitization in asia similar efforts will inevitably find their way into the value chains feeding traditional retail in emerging asian economies already in indonesia for example warung pintar and grabkios are working toward connecting kiosk operators to a centralized supply platform while digitizing and standardizing some of the retail processes through their competing b2b platforms four tiers of response for cpg players the disruptions underway in the traditional trade in emerging asian economies present a significant opportunity to realize value established cpg companies active in these markets must track these developments and prepare an appropriate response through four tiers of rising complexity from noregret moves to total engagement the right level of strategic response can be determined by a companys network size maturity and “bulkiness” of the category without question companies should defend their core business by working with distributors to identify and resolve gaps that are already being addressed by digital disruptors using technology among the measures that can be taken is helping digitize intermediaries to gain access to secondary sales for instance by establishing a distributormanagement system dms helping distributors to build internal capabilities and teaching them to use data appropriately companies can also shift from traditional outlet segmentation which is often based on scale or region to a more sophisticated approach such as grouping outlets based on characteristics of the micromarkets and overall growth potential this would allow companies to create a more relevant assortment across price points and packaging types for different types of outlets increasing throughput it would also ensure the right service level and delivery frequencies improving share of shelf a more proactive approach includes experimenting with smart partnerships consumergoods companies can engage in targeted partnerships that bolster core businesses with minimal channel conflict and complement existing distribution systems for example these alliances can open new micromarkets such as underserved geographies can drive access to new channels such as chemists restaurants and cafes and hotels and can accelerate new product launches and targeted efforts such as premium product sales often these alliances can be tested on a small scale with a range of partners and once the potential of a particular alliance is proven the initiative can be rapidly expanded the current global health crisis may also accelerate the growth in online channels and home delivery services consumergoods companies should watch these trends closely to ensure that they are not left out of these emerging channels at the next level consumergoods companies can create their own proprietary platforms to serve their route to market for traditional trade leading the disruption for most companies the task would require true transformative change but building a digital platform linking small retailers can enhance loyalty and produce significant efficiencies for example the platform could offer retailers immediate ordering options at any time and include benefits such as same or nextday delivery financial solutions loyalty programs and realtime data analytics that support smarter promotions and offer advice on stock replenishment or assortment among other benefits depending on the expected scale and market context companies can create their own platforms or team up with other consumergoods companies for deeper reach and potentially better adherence because of the increased convenience for the retailer as multiple apps will compete for their attention of course companies working together from such a platform cannot offer products that compete with one another the most aggressive option is to build a fullscale ecosystem offering a wide range of products and services similar to those run by alibaba lst in china though similar to a proprietary platform an ecosystem looks at serving the market from a broader retail perspective rather than a narrower consumergoods perspective this option is more scalable but also leaves important elements such as the relationship with retailers or the control of the data in the hands of a third party when to join the platforms and under which conditions the urgency differs by company and category depending on a companys category and current distribution model the incentives to join these platforms and their benefits can vary exhibit 3 for example companies with marginal coverage to traditional trade networks can gain additional reach and there|2020-06-12|0.9996|positive|0.07311389268626112|positive

the future of the threeparty coalition struggling to be born the decision of green party deputy leader catherine martin to challenge eamon ryan for the leadership has added another layer of confusion and distrust to a process that was already being regarded with suspicion by a significant number of people in all of the three parties taking part in the process there is still some doubt about whether the talks will finally conclude with an agreement this weekend although the general expectation is that they have gone too far to end in failure even if there is agreement there is no guarantee that it will be ratified by a twothirds majority of green party members that will depend to a large degree on whether the partys twelve tds give it their enthusiastic backing so far a number of them have given the impression that being in coalition with fine gael and fianna fáil is the last place they want to be and a number of people in the other two parties share that sentiment with regard to the greens “even if eamon ryan manages to drag the greens to the altar this has all the signs of a loveless marriage in the making you have to ask how long it is going to last” remarked one fine gael politician the scale of the problems facing the country in the post covid19 world will require a government that has the ability to take decisive action which will inevitably generate vociferous opposition from political opponents and constant media criticism surviving the pressure will require strong nerves and strong personal bonds between the party leaders as well as a mood of trust among ministers unless a new cabinet is able to unite in a spirit of solidarity behind a programme for government the tensions which have characterised the negotiating process are likely to reemerge that is why a bad start will undermine any chance of dealing successfully with the countrys problems however long the government lasts the record of past coalitions may be some guide to the pitfalls that await if one of the parties lacks wholehearted commitment a classic example is the fine gaellabour coalition of the 1980s led by garret fitzgerald and dick spring which took over the country after the appalling mismanagement of the public finances by charles haughey from the beginning a significant element of the labour party most notably current president michael d higgins and kildare td emmet stagg opposed going into coalition and subsequently did everything possible to make life difficult for spring and his colleagues in government just eighteen months into the lifetime of the government spring almost lost control of his party at its annual conference when he only defeated the anticoalition faction by three hundred and sixtythree votes to 324 higgins then party chairman led the frontal assault denouncing coalition with “the redneck fundamentalists” of fine gael having to deal with such inveterate opponents of coalition meant that spring effectively had one hand tied behind his back and could not agree to the kind of difficult measures that were needed to drag the country out of recession the diary of fine gael minister for education gemma hussey gives a flavour of the kind of tensions that beset that government when the worsening state of the public finances prompted cuts in food subsidies in the summer of one thousand nine hundred and eightyfour there was a political storm “appalling flack going on about the food subsidies the hysteria from michael d higgins joe higgins of the labour left john carroll trade union leader the housewives you name it as well as fianna fáils michael okennedy being extremely rude on radio the media are totally gone off mad” the miracle of that government was that it managed to survive four years and did have some notable achievements to its credit but it was unable to do what ministers knew needed to be done about the economy the lesson is that if the greens go into coalition divided from the start the government will be distracted by interminable internal party wrangling a more hopeful example of how a coalition can work well was the threeparty coalition of fine gael labour and democratic left that held office from late one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfour until one thousand nine hundred and ninetyseven after the tumultuous events that brought albert reynolds crashing down many forecast disaster for the only government formed without an election particularly because of past tensions between taoiseach john bruton tánaiste dick spring and democratic left leader proinsias de rossa in the event it was a reasonably happy and a successful government which left the country it a better position than it found it with the first budget surplus in a generation the key to its success was the level of trust between the party leaders and the discipline shown by the tds of the three parties in keeping the focus on the big issues and refusing to be panicked by every passing storm if the new government can follow that example it might succeed but it will need to put the difficult birth behind it as quickly as possible|2020-06-12|0.9732|positive|0.0610895490205835|positive

european philanthropic foundations have an opportunity to step up and address the needs arising from or exacerbated by coronavirus|we are facing an irreversible humanitarian and economic crisis that will permanently change our world as societies around the world near a standstill the covid19 pandemic has magnified the preexisting vulnerabilities and inequalities of our social systems although governments have put a sweeping range of policies and programs in place to combat the pandemics impact on public health and the economy the scale of the challenge requires more the coronavirus crisis has mobilized an unprecedented response by the philanthropic community our analysis identified combined commitments by european philanthropy of more than €11 billion by may 2020 most geared toward emergency relief to the healthcare crisis as well as general support for struggling nonprofit partners now with the number of acute cases of covid19 going down focus is shifting to the secondary effects of the crisis on the other programmatic areas of foundations now is when we need the greatest possible support and a concerted effort by all actors in society to ensure we not only survive but emerge stronger and better from this crisis european foundations have a unique window of opportunity to step up their actions and play an essential role in the rebuilding and recovery efforts of our countries foundations areas of work are undergoing fundamental changes as key players of recovery efforts foundations need to create and continuously update their knowledge base on the changing environment they operate in to provide foundation leaders with a starting point we have analyzed the underlying challenges and changes brought about by covid19 in six exemplary program areas we offer some key insights here despite having relatively extensive and wellfunctioning publicsafety nets in place europe faces growing issues with universal access to basic needs such as housing food and personal safety even before the covid19 crisis more than 93 million people depended on food banks organizations across europe have reported an increase in demand for food support since the pandemic began—by twenty to twentyfive percent on a national level and by thirty to forty percent in some urban centers such as amsterdam geneva and madrid the looming economic crisis will only worsen the basicneeds emergency in the longer term by threatening the livelihoods of many european families almost fiftynine million people in europe are at risk of unemployment with single parents being three to four times more likely to lose their jobs overall unemployment in europe could almost double to eleven percent seventy million primary and secondaryschool students in europe have been affected by school closures and interruptions although most teachers expect learning loss to be limited some vulnerable students will fall further behind as home schooling amplifies social disadvantages while student access to digital devices and internet is a matter of public debate data shows that ninetyeight percent of students have access to the internet at home and ninety percent of european students have access to a computer they can use for schoolwork the crisis reveals that teachers are in fact the biggest bottleneck to using digital learning with around sixty percent of european students attending schools whose teachers do not have the necessary technical and pedagogical skills to integrate digital devices in instruction once the need for intensivecareunit beds ventilators and protective equipment subsides another health crisis will take center caring for the european population suffering from mentalhealth issues half of frontline healthcare workers are already experiencing ptsd symptoms and more than sixtythree percent of the general population report feeling depressed or anxious because of covid19 the pandemic will significantly increase the prevalence of mental disorders from the current rate of twelve percent of the european population while the effects of covid19 on europe are daunting the international impact could be devastating a total of fiftyfive percent of the global population lacks access to any social safety net jobs and incomes of one hundred and fifty million africans and thirty million indians are vulnerable in the crisis alreadyfragile healthcare systems could collapse from the stress of treating covid19 patients and diverting scarce health resources away from other issues such as malaria and hiv treatment the result could be the death of an additional 24 million children below the age of five to preventable diseases climate change and the environmental crisis is and will remain an emergency for humanity to address the coronavirus crisis has shown us the scale of the response needed to address climate change the slowdown in activity could reduce global greenhousegas emissions by eight percent in 2020 in line with the annual reduction of 76 percent required for the next ten years to keep temperature increases under 15°c by 2050 while the positive effects on emissions will be temporary and have come at an unsustainably high cost to societies the more than 11 trillion of stimulus measures announced by governments across the world represent a unique window of opportunity to promote green measures in the economic recovery this highlevel analysis already shows that foundations are facing significant challenges in all the areas they traditionally work in now more than ever society needs innovation risktaking unconditional funding and fast deployment of private philanthropic resources decisive and bold initiatives for systematic change by foundations could turn this crisis into an opportunity foundations need to reevaluate their portfolio of initiatives foundations should critically review their individual initiatives on how wellsuited each is to implement the foundations overall mission in the current environment such an assessment can serve as a forwardlooking exercise for the foundations new grants or projects though some ongoing grants could shift in mutual agreement with the grantee by reevaluating their portfolio of initiatives foundations can focus their future resources toward the endeavors with the greatest impact in our changing world—taking into account the feasibility and relevance of their projects in light of the new circumstances exhibit the initiatives could then be grouped into the following categories • prioritize when initiatives respond to the needs of the moment and are highly feasible they will naturally become a priority foundations should strongly push the scale of these activities • adapt when an initiative can have high tangible impact for communities yet presents logistical or capacity challenges foundations should try to adapt the delivery model where possible to overcome obstacles • examine once preexisting contractual obligations have ceased initiatives that may now have lower potential impact can be postponed or redirected in mutual agreement with the implementing partner • reassess some initiatives might be less relevant for current needs as well as technically difficult to accomplish in future rounds of grant making and contract renewals foundations need to question any additional attention and resources invested in these activities we hope to see more signature initiatives being rolled out broadly to address some of the emerging opportunities foundations can reimagine their future work now foundations need a higher level of flexibility and speed to respond to the ongoing shifts and challenges in their programmatic areas our interviews with twentysix foundation executives across eight european countries confirmed their organizations have fundamentally changed their internal operations since march 2020 all twentysix shifted their entire office staff to remote work—several adopted workfromhome policies for the first time ever many more foundations implemented new ways of working during the crisis including reducing the burden of and increasing flexibility for implementing partners and accelerating the pace of giving several foundations also deployed rapidresponse grants that cut the approvalprocess time in some cases from several months to less than a day the universal feedback from our interviews was that foundation leaders across europe clearly understand the need to be nimble in a time of crisis and are planning to sustain some of that newfound flexibility and decisionmaking speed in the future several foundations have already decided to keep some level of remote or flexible work arrangements as well as reduce their travel and inperson meetings to an essential level—even when restrictions are lifted the outlook around grant making and project management is less clear while many foundation executives state a desire to maintain the new agility they also voice questions on how to reconcile this approach with the necessary rigor to review projects and provide stability to their implementing partners lessons from agile transformations can help foundations find the right balance our experience and research demonstrate that truly agile organizations master an apparent paradox—they are simultaneously stable resilient reliable and efficient and dynamic fast nimble and adaptive foundations could react quickly to new information adapt their approach in real time and multiply their impact to secure a more stable future by implementing these three agile principles • break down core processes into smaller increments over two to fourweek sprints and involve the end user in the development process early and frequently foundations can segment the grantmaking or projectdevelopment processes that focus on achieving the outlined end product for example an assessment of the implementing partner or a “user test” of the proposed method trying out several small experimental grants while also investigating the issue landscape before committing to the full desired scope can also enhance speed and accuracy agile

on friday during pride month the trump administration finalized a rule that overturns obamaera protections for transgender people against sex discrimination in health care|washington  in a move applauded by president donald trumps conservative religious base his administration on friday finalized a rule that overturns obamaera protections for transgender people against sex discrimination in health care the department of health and human services said it will enforce sex discrimination protections “according to the plain meaning of the word ‘sex as male or female and as determined by biology” this rewrites an obamaera regulation that sought a broader understanding shaped by a persons internal sense of being male female neither or a combination lgbtq groups say explicit protections are needed for people seeking sexreassignment treatment and even for transgender people who need care for common illnesses such as diabetes or heart problems but conservatives say the obama administration exceeded its legal authority in broadly interpreting gender the reversal comes in the middle of lgbtq pride month activists and democratic lawmakers noted that friday was also the fouryear anniversary of the mass shooting at the pulse gay nightclub in orlando florida in which fortynine people were killed behind the dispute over legal rights is a medically recognized condition called “gender dysphoria” — discomfort or distress caused by a discrepancy between the gender that a person identifies as and the gender at birth consequences can include severe depression treatment can range from sexreassignment surgery and hormones to people changing their outward appearance by adopting a different hairstyle or clothing many social conservatives disagree with the concept “under the old obama rule medical professionals could have been forced to facilitate gender reassignment surgeries and abortions — even if they believed this was a violation of their conscience or believed it harmful to the patient” said mary beth waddell of the religious conservative family research council but house speaker nancy pelosi said “religious freedom is no justification for hatred or bigotry and every american has the right to seek and receive care without intimidation or fear” the american medical association strongly criticized the trump administrations action “the federal government should never make it more difficult for individuals to access health care — during a pandemic or any other time“ said dr susan bailey the groups president under the obamaera rule a hospital could be required to perform gendertransition procedures such as hysterectomies if the facility provided that kind of treatment for other medical conditions the rule was meant to carry out the antidiscrimination section of the affordable care act which bars sex discrimination in health care but does not use the term “gender identity” womens groups say the new regulations also undermine access to abortion which is a legal medical procedure “no one should fear being turned away by a medical provider because of who they are or the personal health decisions they have made” said fatima goss graves president of the national womens law center the aclu says it has already moved to try to prevent the rollback of protections for transgender people the lgbtq civil rights group lambda legal said it will sue more than 15 million americans identify as transgender according to the williams institute a thinktank focusing on lgbt policy at the ucla school of law a bigger number — 45 of the population— identify as lesbian gay bisexual or transgender according to gallup roger severino head of the hhs unit that enforces civil rights laws said transgender people continue to be protected by other statutes that bar discrimination in health care on account of race colour national origin age disability and other factors “everyone deserves to be treated with respect and according to the law” said severino “our dedication to our civil rights laws is as strong as ever” he cited recent actions to safeguard access to treatment for disabled people in the coronavirus pandemic for the trump administration its the latest in a series of steps to revoke newly won protections for lgbtq people in areas ranging from the military to housing and education the administration also has moved to restrict military service by transgender men and women proposed allowing certain homeless shelters to take gender identity into account in offering someone a bed for the night and concluded in a two thousand and seventeen justice department memo that federal civil rights law does not protect transgender people from discrimination at work the new rule would also affect the notices that millions of patients get in multiple languages about their rights to translation services such notices often come with insurer “explanation of benefits” forms the trump administration says the notice requirement has become a needless burden on health care providers requiring billions of paper notices to be mailed annually at an estimated fiveyear cost of 29

august while everyone is anxious to facilitate a return to faceto face teaching the logistics are challenging meanwhile the recent reopening of uk primary schools was a shambles in the first week only fiftytwo per cent managed to reopen and only eleven per cent of pupils attended several schools reopened and had to close again immediately for deep cleaning because a pupil or teacher was infected irish principals and deputy principals have been working flat out since the lockdown and there is no end in sight they are currently supervising calculated grades for leaving certs which is an unprecedented pressure even if few parents are attempting to lobby many of them would in other years have the timetable for next year done or mostly done a normal timetable makes threedimensional sudoku look like a snap not only is the timetable not ready but principals have no idea what kind of timetable to formulate for example while it will be very very difficult for primary schools to reopen there is one teacher and perhaps a special needs assistant or two per class in secondary schools with 40minute class periods pupils can have nine different teachers in a single day and no two days of the week are alike even in schools with onehour periods students will have up to six teachers experts currently believe that under existing guidelines schools will only be able to have fifty per cent of their student body in the building at one time some subjects have three periods a week like history it is conceivable that if one half of a year is in the school on alternate days a class might end up with one period in a subject the complications do not end there what about the other half who are at home there has been vague talk of teachers broadcasting or more accurately narrowcasting their classes as they teach how teaching is not lecturing in theory you could set a camera in a lecture theatre and the lecture could be delivered from one point at second level a teacher talking for forty minutes or an hour is a very bad class students should be active interacting with the material each other and the teacher good luck with capturing that with one ipad perched on the teachers desk schools are not set up to work in this way they do not have the necessary equipment and some do not even have decent broadband while online teaching was very demanding and no one wants to go back to it at least it did not involve engaging with pupils in the classroom while also teaching remotely one of the key reasons for going back is to resume productive interaction social distancing will make standard classroom strategies like pair work and group work almost impossible imagine a migraineinducing situation where students are merrily yelling at each other from a twometre distance in the classroom obviously the fifty per cent who will apparently be at home watching on devices will be very disadvantaged and the pace at which material can be covered will slow to a crawl for those in school what happens at break and lunchtime do students stay in a classroom how do they visit the toilets most schools do not have sufficient toilets to allow for queuing in a socially distanced fashion i know schools where heating is rationed in the depths of winter because the school cannot afford it how will they pay for all the additional costs of hand sanitiser soap hot water and face masks for staff and so on what happens if a teacher or student contracts covid19 teachers and students have underlying conditions too testing and tracing are still not up to speed after months of undelivered promises when i wrote recently about my fears for incoming first years third years and most importantly sixth years i was inundated with comments from people annoyed that i had forgotten the particular difficulties facing transition years and second years transition year normally involves extensive interaction with the community for example while it is a concession that classroombased assessments have been modified for third years much more certainty is needed about what accommodations will be provided for sixth years in terms of adjusted exams and course work it already looks like twometre social distancing is unsustainable for the retail and hospitality industries i suspect it will be rapidly reduced to one metre and then disappear altogether whether or not that will lead to a second wave of covid19 is another days work yet principals and deputies in schools who are already exhausted will spend weeks preparing plans on the basis that social distancing will still exist are they supposed to prepare plan a plan b and plan c for various contingencies ranging from full social distancing to one metre to none they will get no break whatsoever it is poor

a billings business has made a national name for itself after food  wine magazine placed the boutique french bakery le fournil on the list of the one hundred best bakeries in the nation|“it was a good boost to the morale because the last few months have been pretty difficult” morin said while covid19 restrictions have shut down many restaurants and bars in downtown billings le fournil was able to operate as a food producer through the closures the small entryway into the bakery forced morin to limit one person in the business at a time the bread is now wrapped in paper sacks and a plexiglass barrier separates customers and staff morin said delivery and curbside pickup have also been available to customers but while the new coronavirus added some stress in business operations the road construction on first avenue north has been a bigger issue curbside pickup hasnt been available for the past two months as the city of billings reconstructs parts of the roadway in the area “it has affected our business much more than the covid” morin said morin didnt have much luck when he applied to a few grants to help with operating costs but he said that its better that the money goes to restaurants and other businesses that couldnt stay open hes seen fewer customers compared to the last two years but the bakery was able to continue operating|2020-06-13|0.5544|positive|0.11899200336700337|positive
the european central bank ecb is the central bank of the nineteen european union countries which have adopted the euro our main task is to maintain price stability in the euro area and so preserve the purchasing power of the single currency|the path out of uncertainty remarks by christine lagarde president of the ecb via videoconference at the inaugural session of the italian national consultation there is no doubt that the economic situation we face today is characterised by profound uncertainty looking into the future has rarely been harder but as abraham lincoln said “the best way to predict your future is to create it” and this is the theme that i want to emphasise in my remarks today obviously there are some major unknowns that we cannot do much about such as possible second waves of the virus or when exactly vaccines will arrive but there are steps we can take to help navigate out of the fog of uncertainty most importantly we need to elaborate and propose a reliable compass – that is a positive vision of what our economy will look like after our economies are entering an inevitable phase of transformation but if policymakers can demonstrate that we will emerge together from the crisis stronger – with more agile more modern and more equal economies than before – we can ensure a more resilient recovery today and more sustainable growth in the future the crisis is weighing heavily on the euro area economy business investment looks to have collapsed in the first quarter even more strongly than gdp measures of consumers propensity to save have surged to historical levels far above what we saw after the lehman crash some of this reflects “forced saving” because people have been unable to spend and will therefore reverse naturally but we are also seeing significant precautionary saving which is a sign that households are preparing for an uncertain future and uncertainty is likewise a key factor in weak business investment there are two main sources of uncertainty today the first source is uncertainty about how the economy will recover from the coronavirus covid19 which is evident in the eurosystems latest macroeconomic projections our baseline projection sees gdp falling by 87 this year but this is surrounded by a wide range of potential scenarios in our mild scenario the drop in gdp would be 59 this year and in our severe scenario it would be 126 in this latter case output would still be well below its precrisis level at the end of 2022 faced with such an outlook it is understandable that households are anxious about their future incomes and firms are hesitant about making irreversible decisions in particular many citizens fear that in a slow recovery some jobs will be lost once government support schemes are phased out this underlines why it is so important that the recovery is properly managed and that the economy is adequately stimulated confidence in government policies is critical to reducing uncertainty which is itself a form of stimulus in fact results of a survey conducted at the ecb show that households that assess government policies as adequate have lower uncertainty about their future income the second source is uncertainty about how the economy will change in response to covid19 it is becoming increasingly clear that the crisis will restructure our economies in fundamental ways in the manufacturing sector we are likely to see a push to make supply chains more resilient which will likely lead to a greater focus on “proximity” ie onshoring of production and reinforcing of strategic value chains in the services sectors by contrast the pandemic is likely to shift the economy towards more “distancing” via more digitalisation we are already seeing this transition accelerate as retail trade gravitates towards ecommerce services that we previously thought were “nontradeable” start being traded online and more remote working becomes possible as the workplace changes profoundly it will take time for the new equilibrium in the economy to appear some sectors will grow and create more jobs as their reach increases – think of communication or education and training for example but other sectors could undergo significant changes if say people no longer need to commute into work to the same extent or to make as many business trips or attend as many conferences where they consume hospitality services this rebalancing should lead to higher investment in intangible capital but part of the capital stock related to tangibles could be superseded if such changes happen too rapidly they can lead to temporary disruptions in the labour market1 so it is natural for people to wonder what the economy will look like in the future and how we will ensure sustainable growth our task today – if we want to prevent a persistent increase in precautionary saving and instead to direct such saving towards needed investment – is to provide them with credible answers dealing with uncertainty about the outlook is the task of stabilisation policies and here the ecb will continue to take all necessary steps within our mandate of price stability – for all euro area citizens in all parts of the euro area already our policies have dispelled tail risks in financial markets that could have led to selfreinforcing vicious circles we are now orienting our measures to ensure that the right financial conditions are in place to support a recovery from the crisis this was the motivation behind our recent decision to expand our pandemic emergency purchase programme to €135 trillion coupled with the up to €3 trillion we are making available to banks that lend to the real economy but monetary policy cannot address the more profound questions about how the economy will look in the future historical experience suggests that major economic shifts like the one we are going through today require government action to foster change and smooth the transition to the new normal in particular governments need to foster innovation by providing the right framework to encourage experimentation and risktaking in new and growing sectors and to support the transition to new jobs for people working in “sunset” sectors in parallel they need to ensure that the conditions are in place to direct investment towards the technologies and sectors of the future this requires sufficient financing the european commission estimates that the investment needs for delivering the digital transformation as well as the green transition will be at least €12 trillion over the next two years2 but in a number of countries – italy among them – mobilising investment requires above all a businessfriendly economic environment with efficient and agile public and private services adequate physical and digital infrastructures a wellfunctioning judicial system and a strong financial sector if such actions are taken this crisis can engender a period of positive transformation it offers an opportunity to policymakers to take a decisive step forward towards more inclusive greener and more digital growth a renewed focus on the digital economy for example can help break the negative feedback loop we see in europe between fragmented markets low economies of scale and weak investment in digital capacities which has at times resulted in the knowledge economy in the euro area contributing only about half as much to productivity growth as in the united states3 greater digitalisation would in turn help accelerate the shift in europe towards what the economist carlota perez has termed “smart green growth” which is not only about renewables and sustainable goods but also about innovation in the productivity of resources and the shift from tangibles to intangibles4 europe already hosts the largest ecoinnovation and circular economy industry in the world5 and the euro is the currency of choice for global green bond issuance6 in the twentieth century europe was also at the forefront of the creation of the welfare state the crisis today offers a possibility to consolidate and expand our global leadership on the environmental front and to make it converge with more digital lifestyles – producing a new more sustainable economic model finally the drive to build more resilient supply chains could be the catalyst we need to definitively complete the single market if we are to “deglobalise” while also achieving allocative efficiency and strategic autonomy we will have no choice but to make full use of the size and diversity of our continentwide economy so the potential to frame a positive european vision should i hope be compelling the commissions recovery fund proposal is clearly a key building block in delivering on this goal but the european level cannot be expected to do it alone crucially the recovery fund will only reach its full potential if it is firmly rooted in structural reforms conceived and implemented at the national level we will get a “bigger bang” for each euro spent if countries conduct the structural reforms they need at the same time as an illustration ecb research shows that in the event of a common shock hitting all euro area countries – of the type we have just seen – those with less efficient economic structures can on average suffer up to twice the output loss of a country that is at the frontier of institutional parameters7 the country specific recommendations identify further helpful reforms in italys case i understand that these recommendations call for among other things investing in digital infrastructure for education and training promoting renewable energy production developing ebusiness models and modernising public administration such reforms – designed and owned by you – are indispensable to capitalise on this moment i therefore encourage you as policymakers not to let this crisis go to waste my institution the ecb will play its part within its mandate but it is for you to prove to citizens that our societies will emerge from this transformation stronger and greener if we are collectively successful uncer|2020-06-13|0.9972|positive|0.11599444370062928|positive

your arm this column argues that rejecting the likelihood of eventually rising velocity following the current massive monetary expansion requires an alternative theory of inflation that has successfully eluded all of us thus far ignoring the potential inflationary dangers is the equivalent to an ostrich putting its head in the sand and while the path towards disinflation may be well known it simply isnt available today “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon in the sense that it is and can be produced only by a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output” thus wrote milton friedman in one thousand nine hundred and seventy the counterrevolution in monetary theory and for much of the rest of the last century that doctrine was treated as almost selfevident and taught in most macroeconomic classes at our universities of course there are many qualifications to many of which i contributed in my role as a bank of england economist at the time let us take three such • first the money stock is endogenous even monetary base in a world where central banks use the shortterm interest rate as their primary instrument while inflation requires monetary growth to facilitate and enable it it may not be the ultimate cause of that pressure using monetary measures alone to offset inflationary or deflationary pressures may be somewhat of a blunt instrument and sometimes with undesirable sideeffects whereas focusing on the treatment of the deeper causes though in concert with complementary monetary measures could be preferable • second there are numerous definitions of monetary growth and they frequently move in divergent ways • third and related to the second qualification the velocity of each or any of these can change quite dramatically even over short periods an obvious example of the latter is the total collapse of the velocity of m0 in the aftermath of its huge expansion via quantitative easing following the great financial crisis gfc in some large part because a combination of interest on excess reserves ioer regulation and a desire for liquidity moved commercial banks into a liquidity trap where they were prepared to mop up excess reserves almost without limit thereby disrupting the transmission mechanism to the broader monetary aggregates and the real economy beyond we are of course currently in a context where the velocity of broad money is dropping just about as fast as its overall supply is being expanded this arises from a combination of massive involuntary saving people cannot go on holiday attend theatres buy new clothes etc equivalent falls in the incomes of those supplying such services offset by various forms of fiscal expansion such as paid furloughs and precautionary savings yes indeed but that will not last sometime in the foreseeable future shops hotels even theatres will reopen and the related workers will be rehired at this point velocity will revert back towards normality and what then the correlation between monetary growth and inflation has an historic pedigree as long as your arm rejecting the likelihood of eventually rising velocity following the current massive monetary expansion requires an alternative theory of inflation that has successfully eluded all of us thus far ignoring the potential inflationary dangers is the equivalent to an ostrich putting its head in the sand but to mix my metaphors our typical central bank ostrich has another barrel to their gun thus our typical central bank ostrich will say that even should there be some resurgence in inflation and it goes beyond a welcome offset to prior undershoots “we know how to deal with it” that position strikes me as an ahistorical one perhaps a consequence of economic history in our universities being relegated to a subsidiary status compared for example to mathematical mastery of dsge models even if the path towards disinflation is well known it simply isnt available today the great difficulties that central banks had in raising interest rates sufficiently to conquer inflation in the 1970s are a stark reminder of the difficulties of lowering inflation remember arthur burns 1979 “anguish of central banking” it took the alignment of three key people – steve axilrod a master monetary tacticianstrategist at the fed paul volcker a brave and determined fed chairman and ronald reagan an understanding patient and competent president – to bring off that difficult exercise and what a difficulty it was nominal shortterm rates went above 20 and real shortterm rates were above 5 there was a shortsharp recession many less developed countries got into massive difficulties and almost defaulted and the global systemically important banks were almost all on a marktomarket basis insolvent and that was at a time when the debt ratios both in the public and private sectors were far far lower than today should we see inflation come back and become expected – if only for a relatively short period of years – at a time when unemployment is likely to remain quite high and the debt ratios have gone through the roof with over extended and fragile financial markets is it really sensible to expect that central banks would be politically and socially allowed to raise interest rates on their own account sufficiently to bring inflation back to target after all the vaunted independence of the central bank remains in the gift of each national government except in the case of the ecb where it is protected by a treaty but even there should the ecb try to take back the subsequent inflationary surge by sharply raising interest rates it would be sensible for the mayor of frankfurt to invest in equipment to deter riots and demonstrations indeed in the context of massive government deficits and debt ratios rising sharply over 100 well over the level of reinhart and rogoff feared would normally cause serious economic problems we may need to rethink how to adjust and protect the concept of central bank independence a few brave economists have begun to think along such lines eg bianchi 2020 cukierman 2020 i happen to believe that there are other and better ways to make such adjustments but that is for another column bianchi b r faccini and l melosi 2020 “monetary and fiscal policy in times of large debt unity is strength” cepr

eightyearold” – when abruptly her twitter feed took a sharp swerve sideways she shared an article about period poverty in the developing world and covid19 tacking on her own snarky take “‘people who menstruate im sure there used to be a word for those people someone help me out wumben wimpund woomud” it was an odd way to launch the latest salvo in the most toxic of culture wars if you failed to recognise the phrase “people who menstruate” in an article about menstruation as an assault on your human rights you havent been keeping up with the roiling war over trans issues rowlings tweet elicited equal parts applause and vitriol as she knew it would days later her name was still trending on social media daniel radcliffe eddie redmayne and emma watson distanced themselves from her she was threatened on twitter with “cancelling punching and death” the ugly episode underlined how polarised any discussion about the issues affecting trans and gender nonbinary people has become it is so incendiary so mired in dogma that most sensible compassionate people approaching it with an open mind and a genuine desire to understand take one look and back away in a longer and more nuanced post rowling delves into why she finds the phrase “people who menstruate” to be “hostile and alienating” develops her own thinking on sex and gender and proffers five reasons why she is worried about trans activism reasons 13 are to do with her charitable work and free speech fourth she wonders whether as a “mentally sexless” teenager she too “might have tried to transition” the fifth is that she is a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor with concerns about singlesex spaces when she read about the scottish governments genderrecognition plans she went to “a very dark place inside my head as memories of a serious sexual assault i suffered … recurred on a loop” on the one hand how could you not feel empathy for rowling especially after the sun followed up with a repugnant frontpage interview with her first husband under the headline “i slapped jk and im not sorry” on the other why is she conflating her experience of domestic violence with rights for trans people the two have as much to do with each other as octopuses and stilettos as she acknowledges trans people are frequently victims of violence in this particular culture war where words are weapons of mass outrage there is no room for nuance both sides – trans activists and gender critical feminists – are convinced that they are compassionate wellmeaning people whose duty it is to police the other sides speech both claim a monopoly on the science both throw around unlikely scenarios and terrifying statistics for both social media is their theatre of war but theres only one group directly affected for all the hysterical arguments about bathrooms or elderly women scared to use the marks and spencers changing rooms the only people whose rights are up for grabs are trans and nonbinary people and they for the most part are quietly getting on with their lives far away from the arguments about biology and the shouty slogans if youre a young person with gender identity issues for whom life is a daily struggle against isolation bullying prejudice and violence the culture war swirling around you is a distant roar so far blessedly that culture war has been a distant roar in ireland too here in 2015 without much drama the gender recognition act passed since then ireland has been offering an administrative process for transgender people over eighteen to achieve full legal recognition of their preferred gender to be clear this is no utopia in which to be a trans person but it has got some things right five years on were managing fine in the bathrooms department there have been no showdowns in womens changing rooms no explosion in men who never intend to transition clamouring to be recognised as legally female in all by mid2018 fewer than three hundred gender recognition certs had been issued onto those terrifying statistics rowling claims there has been a 4400 per cent increase in british girls being referred for transitioning treatment she says this is accurate but its coming from a starting point of just forty girls in 2009 she suggests the increase is fuelled by misogyny in reality more young people coming to terms with their identity is positive and empowering she acknowledges that transitioning is a solution for some gender dysphoric people but even this seems to imply there are “good” genuine trans people and “bad” fake ones autistic girls are hugely overrepresented she says and yes studies have found a substantial overlap between transgender identity and autism but it would be grossly ablest to use this as a basis to withhold treatment especially when depression and anxiety are also highest among this group most controversially rowling claims that between 6090 per cent of gender dysphoric teens will grow out of it this figure is based on flawed research which included children who didnt meet the criteria for dysphoria the truth is there are no easy answers here there are risks involved in medical treatment there are risks to withholding it every situation is unique and best figured out privately by those affected and their doctors despite what those who have taken to calling themselves “biological women” insist affording equal rights to trans people does not erode anyone elses rights human rights are not a zero sum game there is no quota on the number of women allowed to exist in the

technology is untested at scale research so far on its impact has been inconclusive slow internet speeds bad hardware and confusing software can negate the time and expense supposedly saved humanrights advocates argue that delivering harsh sentences remotely is “inhumane”—if society is going to condemn someone to death it should have the courage to do it face to face indeed in may a man in singapore received his death sentence for drug smuggling by zoom further digital justice threatens to upend the ancient understanding that courts should be open to the public spectators remind courts that their decisions have bearing on society video access could make courtrooms more accessible by extending the number of people who might attend from a few dozen to thousands or more but as internet users have discovered over the past decade the web is easy to wall off courts could block access with passwords and private zoom sessions or leave proceedings open but difficult to join on hardtofind web pages so video justice needs rules ensuring some public scrutiny for legal systems the pandemic has amounted to an unexpected monthslong experiment into digital procedure richard susskind author of “online courts and the future of justice said at a recent british parliamentary committee meeting that the adoption of remote hearings around the world has for the first time produced a significant amount of data for researchers both civillaw and commonlaw countries appear to be adopting remote courts at similar rates he says countries with a greater openness to alternative disputeresolution processes such as mediation or conciliation may be more open to new technologies initial findings suggest a divergence between the branches of the justice system civil cases—those without juries—appear to transfer easily to cyberspace on june 5th britains civil justice council published a report that surveyed more than 1000 lawyers journalists and members of the public who had taken part in remote civil cases since midmarch some 715 of respondents said they had had a positive or very positive experience with remote hearings yet anecdotal evidence suggests that participants in family courts have been less positive in britain judges have spoken out about the difficulty of handling delicate matters such as child custody remotely familycourt justices often speak directly with lay participants at the end of trials to explain their decisions the internet curtails opportunities to offer empathy outside a hearings regular formalities in criminal courts meanwhile the need for juries has posed big challenges it would be difficult to ensure the impartiality of jurors logging in from their kitchen tables where they could be influenced by outsiders as countries relax socialdistancing restrictions courts may face new and potentially even more difficult questions young demonstrators newly alive to the inequities of the justice system—its great costs

that epidemic exposure during an individuals ‘impressionable years of eighteen to twentyfive has a persistent negative effect on trust in political institutions and leaders especially in democracies combined with other evidence that trust is important for limiting the spread of infection this raises the spectre of a circular selfreinforcing spiral in which poor public health policy leads to deeper distrust further undermining the effectiveness of public health policy it is widely argued eg fukyuama 2020 that the keys to success in dealing with covid19 are “whether citizens trust their leaders and whether those leaders preside over a competent and effective state” by way of example rothstein 2020 ascribes the greater success at containing the covid19 in the nordic countries than in italy in part to greater trust in government trust in government is not a given however dustmann et al 2017 grosjean 2019 specifically there is reason to ask whether covid19 itself will affect trust in political institutions and leaders in a new paper we provide the first evidence on the effects of epidemics on political trust aksoy et al 2020 we use individuallevel data on confidence in political institutions and leaders from the 20062018 gallup world polls gwp fielded in nearly one hundred and forty countries annually our data cover some 750000 respondents from one hundred and fortytwo countries we analyse responses to questions about confidence in the government confidence in elections and approval of national leaders we link these individual responses to the incidence of epidemics since one thousand nine hundred and seventy as tabulated in the emdat international disasters database see figure 1 by incorporating a wide range of fixed effects controlling various observable characteristics as well as past exposure to other economic and political shocks we can address potential concerns with omitted variables figure one average number of people per million affected by epidemics 19702017 notes this figure shows the number of people affected by epidemics per million averaged across all available years source emdat international disaster database 19702017 un population database 19702017 and authors calculations building on previous work suggesting that attitudes and behaviour are durably moulded in what psychologists and sociologists refer to as the ‘impressionable lateadolescent and earlyadult years we show that exposure to epidemics at this stage in the life course durably shapes confidence in political institutions and attitudes toward political leaders on the ‘impressionable years hypothesis see dawson and prewitt one thousand nine hundred and sixtynine and krosnick and alwin 1989 for an economic application see guiliano and spilimbergo 2014 specifically we find that individuals who experience epidemics in their impressionable years specifically ages eighteen to 25 display less confidence in political leaders governments and elections the effects are substantial an individual with the highest exposure to an epidemic relative to zero exposure is 72 percentage points less likely to have confidence in the honesty of elections 51 percentage points less likely to have confidence in the national government and 62 percentage points less likely to approve the performance of the political leader the respective averages of these three variables in our sample are 51 50 and 50 these effects represent the average treatment values for the remainder of life they decay only gradually and persist for two decades the difference between the median age during impressionable years 215 and the median age in the last subsample 405 corresponds to nineteen years figure 2 figure two effects of epidemics in impressionable years over subsamples with rolling agewindows note this figure shows the persistence of the effects on three main outcome variables by restricting the observations to the respondents who are in the 2635 age range at the time of the survey base sample and then repeatedly rolling this age window forward by one year for each separate estimation the plotted coefficient is exposure to epidemic 1825 in equation 1 in aksoy et al 2000 confidence intervals are at 95 significance level source gallup world polls 20062018 and emdat international disaster database 19702017 there is significant heterogeneity in these effects lesseducated individuals respond more strongly adopting even more negative attitudes towards political institutions and leaders residents of urban areas respond more negatively than those residing in rural areas women display larger drops in confidence the negative impact of epidemic exposure is larger in middle and highincome countries we then explore amplification and transmission mechanisms we show that the effects we identify are specific to communicable diseases such as viruses which can spread contagiously and where a timely and effective public policy response is critical for containment for noncommunicable diseases in contrast we do not see the same impact of past impressionableyear outbreaks on subsequent views of the trustworthiness of governments and leaders in addition individuals exposed to epidemics in their impressionable years are less likely to have confidence in the public health system and the safety and efficacy of vaccination the former is indicative of trust in the overall health policies of the government while the latter can be taken as reflecting attitudes specifically toward pharmaceutical interventions these findings suggest that the perceived inadequacy of healthrelated government interventions during epidemics both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical are important for trust in government more generally in addition the magnitude of the effect we identify depends on the strength of the government at the time of the epidemic when individuals experience epidemics under weak governments the negative impact on trust is larger and more persistent this is consistent with the idea that such governments are less capable of effectively responding to epidemics hence leading to a longterm fall in political trust we substantiate this conjecture by considering this same conditioning factor government strength in the context of covid19 we show that government strength is associated with statistically significant improvements in policy response time the number of days between the date of first confirmed case and the date of the first nonpharmaceutical intervention this supports the notion that government strength at the time of the epidemic is a predictor of effective policy responses and that its absence amplifies the negative revision of political trust in response to epidemics finally we show that our results are driven by the reaction to epidemic exposure in democracies in democracies residents sharply and persistently revise downward their political trust in the event of impressionableyear epidemic exposure the same is not true in autocracies evidently citizens expect democratic governments to be responsive to their health concerns and where the publicsector response is not sufficient to head off the epidemic they revise their views in unfavourable ways in autocracies in contrast there may not exist a comparable expectation of responsiveness and hence no impact on political trust in addition democratic regimes may find consistent messaging more difficult because such regimes are open they may allow for a cacophony of conflicting official views resulting in a larger impact on trust when things go wrong trust and confidence in government are important for the capacity of a society to organise an effective collective response to an epidemic yet there is also the possibility that experiencing an epidemic can negatively affect an individuals confidence in political institutions and trust in political leaders with negative implications for this collective capacity we have shown that this negative effect is large and persistent its largest and most enduring impact is on the attitudes of individuals who are in their impressionable lateadolescent and earlyadult years when an epidemic breaks out in addition epidemic exposure in ones impressionable years matters mainly for residents of democratic countries residents in democracies sharply revise downward their confidence and trust in political institutions and leaders following significant exposure whereas the same is not true in autocracies it may be that citizens expect democratic governments to be responsive to their concerns and that where the publicsector response is not adequate they revise their attitudes unfavourably in autocracies there may not exist a comparable expectation of responsiveness in addition democratic regimes may find consistent messaging more difficult because such regimes are open they may allow for a cacophony of conflicting official views resulting in a larger impact on confidence and trust the implications are disturbing imagine that more trust in government is important for effective containment but that failure of containment harms trust in government1 one can envisage a scenario where low levels of trust allow an epidemic to spread and where the spread of the epidemic reduces trust in government still further hindering the ability of the authorities to contain future epidemics and address other social problems as schmitt 2020 puts it “lack of trust in government can be a circular selfreinforcing phenomenon

the european central bank ecb is the central bank of the nineteen european union countries which have adopted the euro our main task is to maintain price stability in the euro area and so preserve the purchasing power of the single currency|interview with luis de guindos vicepresident of the ecb conducted by maría jesús pérez on nine june two thousand and twenty and published on fourteen june two thousand and twenty european economics and finance ministers met on tuesday to discuss the eu recovery plan to deal with a postcovid19 scenario using guarantees why wasnt there an agreement a consensus has not been reached yet and some countries seem reluctant to sign an agreement but we are confident that they will be able to do so at the end of july a strong european response is essential to ensure that every country is included in the recovery in any case the coronavirus crisis is wreaking havoc on the world economy in europe for example the ecb was expecting the economy to grow by 08 this year but last week ecb president christine lagarde acknowledged that it would contract by 87 in 2020 which is a downward revision to your projections of almost 10 and an “unprecedented contraction” in the euro area economy is the situation likely to worsen or will the support packages approved by the eurogroup and by the ecb be enough to bring about a recovery there is currently a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the economic projections gdp fell by 36 in europe in the first quarter our projections see gdp shrinking by 13 in the second quarter and we expect the economy to start to recover from the third quarter onwards that would mean an overall decline of 87 however there is so much uncertainty that we are working with three potential scenarios these range from the mildest which is very unlikely and entails a decline of just under 6 to the most severe in which we see gdp declining by over 12 the final data will be determined by economic developments once most of the restrictions that we have been living under as a result of the need to impose a lockdown have been lifted we saw the worst of the situation around the middle of april are you ruling out an increase in the ecbs pandemic emergency purchase programme pepp after the summer or is another new injection of funds possible we have just increased the pepp we started with €750 billion in march and we increased that by €600 billion to €1350 billion on four june with purchases that will be conducted until at least the first half of 2021 its an enormous purchase volume and comes on top of the asset purchase programme app the ordinary debt purchase programme that we already had with purchases at a monthly pace of €20 billion and to which we added a further €120 billion in march with all of this our purchases would come to €1700 billion which is a huge amount and depending on economic conditions and our inflation projections we are always open to recalibrating the programme do you monitor whether this capital is being used correctly our purchases are not conditional to decide on the appropriateness and proportionality of the programme the ecb takes into account inflation expectations which are now lower than before the pandemic and financial conditions we try to prevent a tightening of financial conditions because that would have a severe impact on credit and sovereign bonds and could lead to fragmentation in the euro area the asset purchases are allocated in accordance with the capital key which is calculated based on the gdp and population of each country and in the pepp we have greater flexibility in its implementation in general countries spend then they borrow to pay for their spending and to ensure that the cost of debt doesnt weigh too heavily on their budgets the ecb buys that debt then what dont you think well be living in a world flooded with liquidity with lots of social expenditure very limited productive investment and high levels of unemployment the ecb focuses on its inflation aim and on ensuring that there isnt a tightening of financial conditions because that would have very negative consequences and we must prevent any fragmentation in the bond markets we are taking the necessary measures to tackle the pandemic the quality of public finances is the responsibility of governments and the european commission which as its known in the current circumstances will not be calling for the implementation of the stability and growth pact at the ecb as ive already said our actions are guided by our inflation aim of below but close to 2 over the medium term the current projections show inflation at 13 in 2022 so we are still a long way from the aim and our stimulus measures are necessary it finally seems that support for the southern european countries will come despite the reluctance of their northern counterparts do you think there will be any strings attached to this support will the support for spain come without any conditions its very important that the european commissions recovery plan for the postcovid19 economy is approved not only because of how much money is involved but also because of the message of united action that it sends out monetary policy cannot be the only european policy being used to counteract the impact of the pandemic on european economies an agreement would send a message that there is political will to do so among all countries the proposed plan will be linked to the european semester which coordinates economic and budgetary policies within the eu the commission has initially given carte blanche for fiscal policy action in the short term but it will ensure that public finances are brought back onto a sustainable path over the medium term the banco de españas projections for the spanish economy and its recovery have been another heavy blow it previously warned that extending the lockdown would mean a longer recession and higher unemployment but nobody listened yesterday it made further downward revisions to its gdp and unemployment forecasts given the lack of effective measures from the government you said that if things are done correctly we will see a rebound and a return to precrisis levels of activity have you changed your view after seeing the banco de españas forecasts at the ecb we are constantly in touch with the national central banks the banco de españas projections are in line with what we have published for the euro area as a whole there are signs that economic activity is picking up as countries are reopening their economies and lifting restrictions on movement lockdown measures and the like whats key is knowing how quickly countries will be able to recover what was lost during the four months from march to june and for that recovery to take place as soon as possible every country must ensure the survival of most of the businesses that were active before the crisis how can they do that one way is by introducing liquidity support measures such as government loan guarantee schemes – like through the ico official credit institute in spanish instituto de crédito oficial in spain – and by trying to minimise the costs borne by companies at a time when they have practically no income and through temporary unemployment schemes such as the erte temporary layoff scheme in spanish expedientes de regulación temporal or erte in spain the shock received has been huge the banco de españa sees the spanish economy shrinking by between 15 and 20 in the second quarter and the ecb sees a contraction of 13 in the euro area as a whole the main question is how can we reboot economies with as much force as possible and ensure that countries are quick to address the gap in income unemployment and the economic downturn brought about by the pandemic for that to happen its vital that as many businesses as possible survive businesses that were solvent before the pandemic must still be solvent afterwards because they are the ones that must drive the economy and is spain doing the right things to bring about this rebound are the measures taken the ones that we need are they the right ones what still needs to be done im not going to comment on specific countries generally speaking every country should have loan guarantees support measures such as tax moratoria the possibility of postponing social security contributions during this period and temporary employment schemes like the erte all of these measures will lead to a very significant increase in the public deficit and fiscal policy planning will be needed to address this expenditure after all the fiscal efforts required right now once the pandemic is over countries will of course be left with something they wont be able to avoid a very significant increase in the government debttogdp ratio on average the debttogdp ratio for the euro area as a whole could increase by between fifteen and twenty percentage points this situation is the result of an expansionary fiscal policy required to tackle the pandemic and it will have to be addressed in the future so that the public deficit can return to a path that is considered to be sustainable over the medium term by cutting public spending and putting up taxes it will depend on each country but every euro area country will have to deal with this new economic situation after heavy public spending programmes and a significant dip in tax revenues this will lead to a larger hole in the public finances which will have to be covered by government debt the ecbs debt purchases are preventing a fragmentation of bond markets and a tightening of financial conditions which is greatly helping all countries prevent the health and economic crisis from being exacerbated by a debt crisis once we see a return to growth countries will have to address the situation by reducing this extraordinary spending and recovering tax revenues this will be an individual task for each country but it will be of vital importance and as the governor of the banco de españa said it will require a fiscal consolidation plan lasting several years you were in favour of a

social distancing measures creating substantial uncertainty about worker productivity this column presents a theoretical framework suggesting that such job uncertainty reduces aggregate demand and dampens business investment in general however automation may provide one way for businesses to cope with the uncertainty about worker productivity it appears that pandemicinduced job uncertainty could stimulate automation investment despite declines in aggregate demand the covid19 outbreak is leading to a steep decline in global economic activity as countries around the world use social distancing measures to avoid exposure to the coronavirus or to limit its spread the pandemic has also led to a surge in uncertainty the ‘vix – a frequently used measure of uncertainty – spiked to levels surpassing even those experienced during the 20072008 global crisis see figure 1 while the vix has declined since its march peak its level remains elevated by historical standards suggesting that households and businesses are still facing a highly uncertain environment an important source of this uncertainty stems from the unknown evolution of the virus and the effectiveness of social distancing measures absent the discovery of an effective vaccine with widespread availability additional waves of infections remain a possibility thus social distancing measures and lockdowns may need to be periodically reintroduced to deal with future infection flareups which may portend a ‘new normal in which viral infections become more pervasive and forceful such an uncertain environment is highly challenging for businesses that need employees to be on site since workers may be exposed to potential health risks or have to stay home due to lockdowns thus businesses may need to consider alternative strategies to minimise the impact of future production disruptions for some businesses automation may be an attractive option eg kilic and marin 2020 by reducing the need for onsite human interactions investing in robots for instance could help address concerns about future viral outbreaks and the associated production disruptions on the other hand businesses typically refrain from investing in the face of heightened uncertainty preferring to wait for more clarity eg bloom 2009 leduc and liu 2016 as a result while automation may provide one way to cope with the production uncertainty induced by the pandemic it also necessitates investment spending that firms may be reluctant to actually make given the rarity of serious viral outbreaks in much of the world in recent decades empirical results describing how firms adapt to such situations are limited ma et al 2020 provide evidence for the impact of epidemics in asia over the past twenty years but their analysis does not apply to the rest of the world in this context estimated theoretical models can provide a useful alternative complementing some of the emerging work on uncertainty and the pandemic for some recent empirical studies on pandemicinduced uncertainty see baker et al 2020 leduc and liu 2020a and dietrich et al 2020 further the new ebook by baldwin and di mauro 2020 contains additional essays on a wide range of topics related to covid19 economics in a recent paper leduc and liu 2020b we develop a quantitative new keynesian model of the labour market in this model firms face uncertainty about future labour productivity and have the ability to automate jobs we focus on one channel of pandemicinduced uncertainty that we label job uncertainty emphasising the impact that future outbreaks may have on worker productivity for simplicity we assume that productivity is impacted by labourspecific productivity shocks that are subject to ‘secondmoment disturbances capturing variations in uncertainty we build on our earlier work leduc and liu 2019 and study the role of automation in an economy with ‘search and matching frictions in the labour market firms create and post job vacancies to hire workers and produce goods firms that are unsuccessful in finding a worker can decide to automate the job with a robot robots can perfectly substitute for workers therefore differing from physical capital in standard macro models in this sense automation is a form of laboursaving technology adopting a robot entails a fixed cost and using a robot also incurs an operating cost a firms decision to adopt a robot depends on the relative benefit of automating versus keeping a vacancy open if a firm decides to keep a vacancy open it can decide to fill it with a worker or a robot in the future importantly in contrast to workers robots and their productivity would not be susceptible to epidemics since viruses do not impede their ability to produce hence whether to automate or not will partly depend on current and expected future worker productivity and pandemicinduced job uncertainty would be an important factor underlying automation decisions to assess the quantitative effects of job uncertainty we first estimate our model to fit quarterly us time series data from 1985q1 to 2018q4 in addition to the unemployment and vacancy rates we fit the model to the time series of real wages labour productivity inflation and nominal interest rates since the rate of automation has important implications for productivity and wage growth including these variables helps discipline the importance of automation in our estimation we do not consider pandemicinduced uncertainty since pandemics are not observed in our sample after we estimate the model we introduce uncertainty shocks to worker productivity to examine its macroeconomic effects we show that an increase in pandemicinduced job uncertainty operates through two channels a demandreducing channel and a technologyswitching channel first the job uncertainty raises precautionary saving and reduces household consumption since prices are sticky firms cut production to meet the reduced demand for their products all else being equal the decline in economic activity reduces a firms incentive to invest in automation however through the technologyswitching channel the job uncertainty would incentivise a firm to automate since robots are not susceptible to viruses and can continue to operate during epidemics figure two shows that a pandemicinduced uncertainty shock raises the unemployment rate whilst also boosts automation in the benchmark model the blue solid lines these impulse responses reflect that the technologyswitching channel dominates the demandreducing channel under our estimation in general increased automation can have ambiguous impacts on employment since robots substitute for workers increased automation tends to reduce employment however given the option of automation a firm would have a stronger incentive to create new job vacancies because of the reduced risks associated with hiring workers under our estimated parameters this latter channel boosts employment and outweighs the laboursubstituting effects of automation to illustrate the interactions between automation and unemployment in our model we consider a counterfactual model in which automation is kept constant at its steadystate value figure two shows that with no fluctuations in automation a pandemicinduced job uncertainty shock would have led to a deeper recession with a sharper increase in unemployment the red dashed line therefore endogenous automation decisions help alleviate the recessionary impact of the job uncertainty shock an alternative way to interpret our results is that automation reduces some tasks done by workers whereas it facilitates other tasks which boosts overall employment eg acemoglu and restrepo 2019 figure two impulse responses to job uncertainty shock in the estimated model in our model the effects of an increase in job uncertainty differ markedly from a realised decline in labour productivity such as that occurring in the current pandemic since social distancing measures and health concerns during a pandemic can hinder a workers ability to work the fall in labour productivity primarily acts as a negative supply shock that reduces potential output and increases inflation as a result firms automate less in contrast pandemicinduced job uncertainty leads to a recession by reducing aggregate demand such that both output and inflation decline despite the decline in demand firms still increase automation investment because of the positive technologyswitching channel overall our finding suggests that pandemicinduced job uncertainty shocks can have a positive net effect on automation investment despite its negative effects on aggregate demand although robots can substitute for workers the increased automation stemming from the technologyswitching channel can still mitigate job losses the option of automating reduces the risk of hiring workers and thus boosts a firms incentive for creating new positions authors note opinions expressed are the views of

senator jeff|eight hundred and ten students graduated from the oregon institute of technology on saturday through a virtual ceremony with prerecorded messages from university president dr nagi naganathan us senator jeff merkley oregon health and sciences university president dr danny jacobs and other student and university leaders “graduates as the class of 2020 an imperative has fallen on you that you did not ask for and did not expect our world changed so dramatically and so quickly almost overnight in ways that have affected just about everyone not just in our neighborhoods or our states or even our country but globally” said naganathan in his virtual address to students “while you likely have some strong feelings about having to miss the important rite of passage of an inperson commencement ceremony as we do i must tell you something very important and very real this is your time” after several speakers faculty read the names of graduates while their names appeared on screen on an image of an oregon tech diploma faculty for the various departments students received degrees in appeared on screen after all of the gradates for that department where the instructors sent well wishes and congratulations to the students they worked with throughout the years while naganathan acknowledged the change of course for spring term due to covid19 which was held remotely through online classes he told the hn that he felt both faculty and students met the challenge well merkley in his virtual address highlighted some of the achievements of graduates along with some noteworthy alumni activities “when the world says ‘how those who specialize in technology say ‘heres how” he said “thats where you the oregon tech class of two thousand and twenty come in each of you has the instincts and the training to take on the challenges of this moment and the years to come” “you are in a unique position to use what youve learned and the knowledge that you can overcome any obstacle in your way including a global pandemic to create those ideas that will change the world” jacobs encouraged graduates to remain resilient as they being their careers “i feel hopeful and inspired that you will play a significant role in shaping the bright future that is sure to come and you should take great pride in what will be an extraordinary place in history as you work together to rebuild an even stronger more prosperous equitable and communityminded nation” jacobs said student speaker clark anderson encouraged his fellow gradates to be more than just acceptable as they enter their careers “however i want to encourage you to be more more than just productive more than just another cog in the machine more than just another average employee be bold be brave be confident speak up stand out ask questions make yourself indispensable” he said “in short leave every place you go better than when you found it make an impact leave a legacy that will make you proud of yourself everyone around you proud to have known you and oregon tech proud to have been part of your story” although naganathan acknowledged that it was disappointing that they couldnt have their traditional inperson ceremony he still feels oregon techs virtual ceremony was memorable for the graduates “we have done our best we are not sparing any effort as a matter of fact as a matter of symbolism the provost the dean and myself are going to be on campus celebrating our students we have taken care of as many details as possible so that this is a great celebration for our students” he said “while there are disappointments for that not being traditional in some ways we are also making it special in our own way i think people will remember this commencement in a unique way” graduates could also come by the klamath falls campus to get pictures with nagathan and other university leadership on saturday according to oregon tech more than 1300 people viewed the virtual ceremony in the first four hours on saturday while covid19 made it more challenging for oregon tech students to finish their degrees naganathan said that it also created more opportunities for students to be involved in how their field changes through this pandemic particularly health care fields “instead of looking at it as only a challenge i keep asking myself and asking my colleagues so where are the opportunities” he said “remote care may take a different level of achievement and this changes how we get cared for and there lies the opportunities in innovating new programs and new opportunities for our students and our society” “i do not look at all of this as only a challenge i think there are great opportunities to redefine education for the next fifty years by doing the right things right now” while whether or not students will be able to return to campus come fall term remains uncertain naganathan said they are planning for an inperson year in case it is possible oregon tech already had quite the catalog of online classes so naganathan said he felt they were more prepared than others for the required move to distance learning for spring term still he said the university is known for its lab classes and not being able to have those classes was tough “considering all the challenges i feel it was an amazing year in a sense of accomplishment having overcome the challenges” although the second part of the year took a challenging turn naganathan said that other achievements like the largest freshman class in the universitys history new degree programs and new construction projects on campus helped make this year a success naganathan described this graduating class as one that will utilize the adversity they faced this year to change the future “i know you are prepared to go out and transform the world and so do all of your professors and staff who have supported you as well as your families and friends” naganathan said in his commencement speech “and when you help the world overcome this tremendous time of challenge and struggle you will know that you have been part of bringing us back and that class of 2020 is your legacy that is your 2020 vision”|2020-06-14|0.9995|positive|0.28529338023088024|positive

findings on the role of international trade of essential medical goods in exacerbating or mitigating the impact of a pandemic the effects depend crucially on the countries trade imbalances in essential medical goods net importers of these goods are relatively worse off during a pandemic than net exporters although the welfare losses of net importers are lower in a world with high trade barriers they benefit from reducing barriers once the pandemic arrives the ongoing covid19 pandemic has led to a massive increase in the demand for essential medical equipment to combat the spread of the disease for instance goods such as masks gloves respirators and covid19 tests are playing a key role in allowing healthcare workers to respond to the ongoing pandemic while supply has been gradually increasing to try to satisfy the high demand for these goods countries continue to face supply shortages and are increasingly forced to ration these goods amidst the growing fear of these supply shortages countries have been resorting to trade policy to meet domestic demand according to evenett 2020 “a growing number of governments have been sickening their trading partners by banning or limiting the export of medical supplies” in our recent paper leibovici and santacreu 2020 we document that the heterogeneous response of trade policy across countries is systematically related to the extent to which countries are net importers or net exporters of essential medical goods we then develop a general equilibrium model of international trade to study the role of trade of essential goods in mitigating or exacerbating the effect of a pandemic like covid19 we combine data on import liberalisations and export restrictions from global trade alert with international trade flow data on essential medical products to fight covid19 from un comtrade we find that of one hundred and nine countries studied twentynine countries have implemented some type of liberalisation on essential medical products since april 2020 whereas fiftynine countries have imposed restrictions moreover recent changes to trade policy for essential medical goods appear to be systematically related to countries positions as net suppliers or net importers of these goods as of twentyfour april 86 of the countries with a trade surplus in these goods have recently imposed restrictive export policies while this has been the case for only 46 of the countries with a trade deficit these findings suggest that international trade plays a fundamental role on the crosscountry impact of a pandemic in leibovici and santacreu 2020 we investigate the role of international trade of essential goods in mitigating or exacerbating this impact we ask two questions 1 to what extent does the impact of a pandemic depend on whether countries are net exporters or net importers of essential goods 2 what is the role of international trade in mitigating or exacerbating the impact of the pandemic we address these questions using a dynamic quantitative general equilibrium model with two countries and two sectors one sector producing essential goods ie medical equipment and the other sector producing nonessential goods there are adjustment costs to capital and labour in each sector we assume that both countries are symmetric throughout except that one country is relatively more productive in essential goods while the other is relatively more productive in nonessential goods leading the former to be a net exporter of essential goods and the latter to be a net importer of essential goods to what extent does the impact of a pandemic depend on whether countries are net exporters or net importers of essential goods we find that in our model a global pandemic has significant heterogeneous effects across countries net importers of essential goods are relatively worse off during a pandemic than net exporters there are two main forces at play first given that it is costly to reallocate production inputs across sectors producers of essential goods cannot sufficiently boost production leading to a substantial increase in their relative price then while the price of essential goods increases similarly in both economies the effect on welfare depends on the countries sectoral trade imbalances both countries earn relatively more for their sales of essential goods and both countries have to spend relatively more for their purchases of these goods however given that the net importer is less productive in essential goods this country sells less than it purchases while the reverse is the case for net exporters as a result net importers of these goods are relatively worse off in leibovici et al 2020 we document that the us relies heavily on imports of essential medical goods thus according to the model the us is likely to be relatively worse off from the supply shortages of medical products amid the covid19 pandemic than if it were to be a net exporter of these goods what is the role of international trade in mitigating or exacerbating the impact of the pandemic we find that the level of international trade barriers at the onset of a pandemic can significantly alter its economic implications in our model higher initial trade costs imply that the net importer runs a smaller trade deficit of essential goods than in a world with lower trade costs while the net exporter runs a smaller trade surplus in these goods therefore while a pandemic continues to lead to a substantial increase in the relative price of essential goods the relative impact on the home and foreign countries is mitigated we thus conclude that while higher trade barriers on essential goods may reduce the amount consumed of these goods they mitigate the potential vulnerability of net importers of these goods when a global pandemic hits these findings have important implications for the design of international trade policy even if countries may benefit on average from having cheaper access to goods the reliance on international trade might put these countries in a vulnerable position if these goods are essential and either the supply or demand of these goods is subject to global shocks while these findings are informative about the exante design of international trade policy they are silent about the impact of trade policy changes implemented once a pandemic hits we thus conclude our analysis by asking what is the impact of raising trade barriers in response to a pandemic in contrast to the previous findings we now find that raising trade barriers when the pandemic hits can significantly exacerbate the welfare cost faced by net importers of essential goods as a net importer the home countrys production structure is such that it relies considerably on the foreign country for its consumption of essential goods thus an increase in trade barriers on these goods exacerbates the already painful situation faced by the net importer making the relative price of essential goods even higher these results suggest that the design of international trade policy for essential goods may suffer from a timeinconsistency problem net exporters of essential goods may exante prefer to live in a world with low trade costs but when a global pandemic hits they might be tempted to renege on their previous commitments and increase trade barriers the reverse is the case for net importers of essential goods as they exante prefer to live in a world with high trade costs on these goods but when a global pandemic hits they would be tempted to renege on their commitments and instead decrease trade barriers events such as the current pandemic can lead to increased sentiment against international trade openness our research suggests there are no blanket solutions trade openness can be effective at addressing local shocks such as domestic pandemics but it can raise tensions in the context of a global shock such as covid19 the design of trade policy agreements needs to be considered carefully to ensure we get the benefits of trade while minimising the potential pain when global shocks hit this is a key challenge raised by covid19—one we should try to meet to avoid falling back into a world with high trade barriers and the large costs that it would entail in baldwin and evenett 2020 several contributors discuss how governments should react to this type of crisis finally although we do not explicitly model supply chains our column is related to an ongoing discussion on the disruption of global value chains amid covid19 the current pandemic raised questions on the potential vulnerability of relying on foreign supply chains during a global shock leading to a surge in arguments for protectionism and selfreliance bonadio et al 2020

boris johnson exhausted and looking increasingly forlorn appears to have a few short weeks to salvage his reputation and save his government from ridicule still recovering from his neardeath experience with covid19 the prime minister faces unprecedented obstacles to prevent britain slipping into a deep recession with so many cards stacked against him our sallowfaced and holloweyed leader has squandered much of the goodwill he accumulated after his landslide election victory in december even his friends whisper that there is no captain on the bridge steering the ship according to a yougov poll johnsons handling of the virus is rated as the worst of all world leaders many will discount the criticism as unfair contrary to predictions of doom from the left the nhs has performed brilliantly eight million workers have been protected by the chancellors £80 billion furlough package most of the country is becoming free of covid despite our economy shrinking by twenty per cent in april it still ticks over johnsons misfortune is that those achievements have been drowned out by the impression of defeat hampered by downing streets cackhanded communications johnson is mischievously blamed for orchestrating a shambles some believe his seeming impassivity sporadic public appearances and blustering press conferences are proof hes still suffering the aftereffects of covid combined with sleepless nights with a sixweekold baby some of his harshest critics have boldly stated that if he had still been married to marina his longsuffering exwife ‘who was unafraid to dispense home truths johnsons life would be more stable than with a fiancee twentythree years his junior such censure though ignores boriss strength over the years he has successfully compartmentalised his private and public lives and since there is no obvious leading tory who might put themselves forward as an alternative prime minister his supporters are convinced that not all is lost just as his hero winston churchill led britain out of its darkest hour in 1940 johnson needs to summon the courage ideas and energy to enthuse the nation with a blueprint that will stop us coming out of lockdown in tatters he also needs to fire failing ministers – of which there are several – and civil service timeservers on whom he has mistakenly relied the fact is he has little time no later than july 1 just eighteen days away johnson needs to address parliament and then the nation on tv to give the country confidence to believe that his government machine is firing on all cylinders we all need to be reassured that we can rely on the prime minister to restore normality as quickly as possible johnsons priorities must be to revive the economy reopen all schools launch a major resurgence of britains cultural institutions such as cinemas museums concert halls and theatres encourage pubs and restaurants to reopen and finally to rebuild his government with inspiring and gifted politicians it is exactly five weeks ago that johnson lost his halo his disastrous tv address changing the slogan from ‘stay home to ‘stay alert was confusing vague and greeted by widespread irritation accused of confusing the message johnson lost a huge amount of public goodwill until then many had tolerated the failure to provide nhs staff with sufficient protective gowns for example blaming the global shortage many also understood the crisis in privately owned care homes was not politicians fault but johnsons reputation took a second battering his apparently flippant dismissal of the allegations against dominic cummings for breaking the spirit of the lockdown was a selfinflicted disaster that exposed a gross misunderstanding of the national mood in the past he had listened to the advice of loyal friends outside the downing street bunker suddenly to avoid criticism he is shunning their calls in explaining his plan to relax the lockdown the pm needed senior civil servants to deliver a clear commonsense scheme but they failed in truth johnson has been let down by whitehalls perennial bunglers then he refused to identify and remove the guilty parties by character johnson has an aversion to confrontation to date he has accepted all the scientists advice that must end we now know that their advice until midmarch was muddled or even wrong we also know that the scientists now disagree on the best course forward johnson in his dna a libertarian and freemarketeer must follow his instincts and unshackle himself from the scientists chains he should gamble that the risk of a few extra deaths is outweighed by the urgent need to reopen the country admittedly confrontation often ends in bloodshed but this is the only way for johnson to restore his credibility simultaneously he must change his way of governing until now he has delegated most critical decisions to ministers unwisely he allowed home secretary priti patel to announce a 14day quarantine on travellers entering the uk – something that is unenforceable and has been widely ridiculed similarly he relied on gavin williamson the education secretary but he has blundered embarrassingly over the reopening of schools and most alarmingly he has depended on health secretary matt hancock to mastermind the ‘war against covid it is shocking that britain is third in the world death league from the virus despite only having the 21st largest population the public has lost trust in hancock of whom retired supreme court judge lord sumption wrote last week ‘with his hectoring manner authoritarian assumptions and snarling threats he has resembled nothing so much as the petulant headmaster of a third rate school its not just ministerial incompetence no ten is staffed by people of mixed ability at its heart is sir mark sedwill the cabinet secretary having trained in the home office his specialism is security which means hes been poorly equipped to mobilise the whitehall machine to tackle covid he also neglected to point out to johnson the dysfunctional performance of senior officials in public health england the department of health and hospital trusts johnson should ignore his benign instincts and fire sir mark replacing him with a thrusting agent of change at the same time he should replace the senior civil servants at health education and defence all have failed to deliver whitehall needs to be revolutionised to get britain back on its feet a litmus test of whether the medicine is working will be when we hear the screams of protest by the luddite civil service trade unions just three months ago precovid the johnson governments first budget spelled out an exciting one nation vision chancellor rishi sunak unveiled a visionary £30 billion plan to rebuild our infrastructure and finance a huge expansion to reboot britain the government should double that investment ministers must learn that we overrelied on the power of globalisation and on china of course that will need an army of experts – so in the short term britain should recruit from around the world spending money to rebuild is easy compared to the parallel task of winning the political battle covid aside boris johnson is under attack by those in denial that the tories won a landslide election victory just six months ago and who want to reverse brexit defeating those enemies requires courage and conviction no one doubts that johnson had both these qualities before his illness but now there are worrying signs he is lacking the energy to fight simultaneously on many fronts indeed his enemies smell blood militant teachers have seized the upper hand and shown that their selfish interests are more important than the education of the nations children anarchist mobs have hijacked the black lives matter protests michel barnier the eus brexit negotiator thinks he can bully britain over our exit deal the bbc has become a mouthpiece for antitory criticism wales run by labour and the nationalist government in scotland are defiantly following different policies from those pursued in london boris johnson an acute student of history will recall he has experienced a similar hiatus six months into his time as london mayor in 2008 his administration was mired in chaos key appointments were exposed as disastrous after their swift dismissal the arrival of a new chief of staff simon milton transformed johnsons mayoralty now to up his game its not city hall that johnson must rejuvenate but his cabinet and downing street team on a personal level too johnson needs to change gear he must show he is in charge he must offer a vision and a big strategy above all it is imperative that the man who has been seen for years as a great communicator actually communicates better at least for the present he knows that whatever his critics – and they are growing in number daily – throw at him he is the only politician with the capacity to unify and lead britain but even that certainty

following are un secretarygeneral antónio guterres remarks at the united nations global compact leaders summit in new york today|following are un secretarygeneral antónio guterres remarks at the united nations global compact leaders summit in new york today it is a pleasure to greet you as we mark twenty years of the united nations global compact uniting business for a better world by bringing together thousands of private sector leaders as the world faces the covid19 pandemic this summit is an opportunity to reflect on how business can support countries and communities around the world to recover better recover stronger and recover together from the crisis we are facing a health crisis as well as an economic and social crisis with no parallel in the history of the united nations moreover we continue to face a global climate emergency with colossal risks for people and the natural systems that sustain us i am encouraged to see so many companies of so many sizes and from so many sectors and countries recognizing the urgent need for global unity and international cooperation two decades ago my predecessor as secretarygeneral kofi annan called on business leaders to initiate a “global compact” of shared values and principles to give a human face to the global market it was his view that and i quote “if we cannot make globalization work for all in the end it will work for none” today the fabric of society and the well‑being of people hinge on our ability to build a fair globalization the global compact has sought to move us in precisely that direction what started as a niche group of fortyfour business leaders has now blossomed into a global movement encompassing more than 10000 companies 3000 nonbusiness stakeholders and sixtyeight local networks all of these participants are championing the idea that business has a key role to play in creating a world and a global economy where people and planet alike can thrive the initiative is guided by ten universal principles calling for the protection of human rights labour rights environmental responsibility and anticorruption and our shared aim is to see businesses integrating these principles into their core strategy and operations taking strong steps to support the sustainable development goals sdgs and reporting publicly on progress i commend the significant achievements we have made across the years the compact has made immense strides in mainstreaming responsible business leadership practices around the world it has spurred ambition on climate change through the 15°c campaign it has advanced gender equality through the womens empowerment principles and promoted sustainable ethical approaches through the principles for responsible investment the compact has also focused on nurturing the business leaders of tomorrow through the principles for responsible management education where once “do no harm” was a common approach for the business community today we are arriving at a new landscape of elevated expectations and responsibilities but despite progress serious threats could undermine our future including climate change poverty loss of biodiversity and widening social inequalities and the pandemic has underscored the worlds fragilities which extend far beyond the realm of global health now more than ever as big decisions are made about our future companies need to address environmental social and governance risks holistically and move beyond business as usual to advance this work we have announced a set of best practice business benchmarks across all seventeen sustainable development goals as part of the sdg ambition initiative i challenge all of you to take more ambitious and comprehensive action across your operations and value chains by setting goals in line with these benchmarks it is especially important for you to support efforts to achieve emissions reductions of fortyfive per cent from two thousand and ten levels this decade and to reach netzero emissions by midcentury the world also needs a business community fully committed to transparency and accountability we are pressing for companies to report more fully including in line with the task force on climaterelated financial disclosures such steps are crucial for assessing risks that is also why we are updating the compacts annual “communication on progress” framework this will help to establish an open global repository of corporate sustainability data — and thereby enable better assessment of companies sustainability performance and we hope inspire them to raise their ambitions i want to take this opportunity to thank lise kingo for her leadership in steering the work of the united nations global compact for the past five years her contributions have undoubtedly strengthened the united nations systems engagement with business i look forward to welcoming sanda ojiambo into her new role as the next executive director of the initiative i am confident that sanda brings the

public north and south has been fantastic when it comes to safeguarding health the public has always proven to be more than willing do what is needed to avoid catastrophic illness as shaw wrote over a century ago the public “dreads disease and desires to be protected against it” as we have seen sometimes communities took the initiative themselves with parents keeping their children out of school and heads closing schools ahead of central instruction the numbers of deaths and of new positive cases in ireland have fallen steadily north and south as they have reached a low level there is an understandable clamour to get back to normal the effects of the restrictions on all aspects of life have been immense the damage done to businesses and individuals will have health consequences that have yet to materialise or be fully appreciated the very restricted operation of health services will take time to restore and even longer to deal with the backlogs of routine and even urgent care that have built up psychiatrists have predicted a “tsunami” of mental health problems following the crisis arising from conditions exacerbated or created by all that we have been through the bit that no one really wishes to hear and those dutybound to deliver the message keep saying is that we are not done with this coronavirus yet as long as the virus is present and is still being transmitted in our communities workplaces and institutions we risk significant flareups importantly if those flareups are not stamped out immediately the highly infectious nature of the virus has the potential to cause substantially more deaths and disruption what is needed with great urgency is a concerted effort to achieve a “zero covid19 ireland” this will involve getting to zero new cases in both parts of the island and then maintaining and if necessary restoring that position the resulting economic and social benefits would be enormous arguments about distances of 1 15m or 2m would be a thing of the past and our schools theatres arts centres clubs and pubs could get back to enhancing our lives and reconnecting our communities there is absolutely no reason why this cannot be achieved two things about this task are very clear firstly lifting a high proportion of restrictions in a country before eliminating the virus is a recipe for playing an ongoing and exhausting game of cat and mouse with this deadly foe the consequences could be continued and possibly massive disruption the global number of new cases per day continues to grow and resurgence is apparent in some places that have ended lockdown prematurely secondly as far as ireland is concerned the task of eliminating all new cases of the virus occurring through domestic spread ie not coming from newly imported cases can only realistically be carried out on an allisland basis the endgame for covid19 is not yet in sight researchers around the world are working on the development of more than one hundred and thirtyfive separate vaccines there is no guarantee that an effective vaccine will be found and we would be unwise to plan on that basis the best option for ireland is a joint northsouth initiative empowered and resourced to hunt down the remaining cases and hot spots for the virus and deal with them as swiftly as possible learning the lessons from countries such as south korea and germany that are further along the path shows that the capacity to react urgently to any flareups must be strengthened and maintained for the foreseeable future changes are of course needed to harmonise efforts on the island these include details that should have been sorted out by now anyway such as the different isolation times of seven and fourteen days on either side of the border and the fact that “shortness of breath” is a recognised and listed symptom of covid19 in the south but not the north but getting a jointly agreed case finding testing contact tracing isolate and support fttis system is the big priority in border counties in particular the ability to deal with cases and contacts on both sides of the border in a seamless way is crucial in doing the job well speed is everything serious eastwest issues will arise as the island gets close to “zero” status the focus will be firmly on stopping the importation on new cases agreed measures to prevent the virus being reintroduced via ports and airports will be crucial these are not constitutional issues – they are public health issues they are not about sovereignty – they are about human lives and the preservation of jobs and a functioning economy we can revert to tribal allegiances in due course if we really want to but in the meantime lets get the job done dr gabriel scally is president of epidemiology and public health at

stocks they could find sparking a stunning rally in stocks of nearly bankrupt shale companies shares in chesapeake energy for example which has been teetering on the brink of collapse shot up about four hundred per cent in a few days before toppling again towards the end of the week read more • oils dramatic collapse leaves the industry over a barrel • premium  covid nineteen coronavirus why oil crashed  and why petrol prices havent • oil shock coronavirus crash deepens as oil giants wage price war • nz shares fall as oil crash spooks investors investors are just betting on recovery as a theme said nathan anderson at hindenburg research the way they express that is by buying stocks that are the most down hoping that theyll revert to their precovid level hope has also taken hold beyond the day traders on robinhood and other free platforms since midmarch in the bleak days after saudi arabia launched its war for market share the sp five hundred energy subindex has risen by more than sixty per cent beating the rest of the market but can the rally continue the nearuniversal answer outside the reddit stock picking forums is no if the top of the rally was not already reached with the chesapeake rise this week it is not far off true things are not as bleak as they were west texas intermediate the us benchmark is unlikely to fall below zero again soon as it did briefly in april — although some shellshocked traders will have winced as it dropped about twelve per cent in recent days at about 35 a barrel it remains almost double its level at the end of april bulls note that saudi arabia and russia extended their large oilsupply cuts just last week while forecasters from the us government to goldman sachs now expect global oil demand to outpace supply in the second half of this year as economies emerge from coronavirus lockdowns and people start moving exploration and production stocks beaten down by the crash runs the thesis now look attractive but hold on beaten down they may be but stocks are still far from cheap muqsit ashraf of accentures houston energy practice estimates that at current prices oil and gas shares assume oil at about 50 a barrel that cannot last and the equities are more likely to do the correcting than the commodity he predicts retail investors may be piling in but more sophisticated investors such as hedge funds want a retrenchment of twenty per cent to thirty per cent in the stock prices of ep stocks before they start buying again said matt portillo an analyst at tudor pickering holt  co an investment bank most are focused on very few names and are very sensitive about their entry price points this is because the fundamentals of the oil market are less constructive than the bull case suggests despite the opec extension saudi supply is about to rise as the country ditches extra cuts it made in june us production has fallen hard but is picking up refiners are inundated with petroleum products so need less crude us oil stockpiles hit a record high last week covid19 cases are surging anew the glut in other words is far from over and the 45 to 50 price needed by most operators to turn a profit seems a long way off meanwhile the volatility in the market has delayed the mergers and acquisitions that almost all investors want to see across the shale patch so the rest of two thousand and twenty will be characterised more by insolvencies than ma thinks mr portillo adding that buyers may go on the offensive only if prices stabilise well above 50 a barrel meantime the lack of ma will be a damper for equity prices other clouds hang over the sector investors remain jaded by their experience with the shale patch in recent years and want proof that operators will not start chasing volume and abandon pledges of operating within cash flows said jay merchant a portfolio manager at invesco the moment they deviate they will be punished he said meanwhile saudi arabias decision to open the taps in march — its oil is still arriving in the us inflating crude stocks — has spooked many fund managers who appreciate that the sector remains vulnerable to geopolitics from riyadh to washington finally there is oils bigpicture problem even if the producers still believe in the future of their product their investors are increasingly doubtful about oil full stop all told it is little wonder wall street is not yet rushing back to a us ep sector struggling with existential doubts maybe the day traders got it right with their bust shale trade this week — in and out quickly before things get even

a tool that quantifies global happiness on social media recorded an unprecedented dip in mood starting in may|researchers aiming to quantify global happiness on social media have called the period starting on twentysix may “the saddest two weeks” on twitter chris danforth and peter dodds applied mathematicians at the university of vermont in burlington have been tracking public sentiment on twitter since late two thousand and eight using the ‘hedonometer a tool that looks at the words in a randomly sampled 10 of tweets each day and rates them according to how positive or negative they are in midmarch as the covid19 pandemic swept across the western hemisphere the tool charted a deep sustained dip in the global mood then the worldwide protests following the killing of george floyd in may set off a second wave of negative sentiment on the platform unlike anything danforth and dodds have ever seen see ‘the many moods of twitter the hedonometer compares the language used in tweets to a database of more than 10000 common words culled from google books the new york times music lyrics and twitter itself that have been scored by fifty people on a 9point scale neutral words and those which receive a large range of scores are excluded from the analysis certain events — such as mass shootings announcements of controversial government policies and deaths of wellknown figures — show up in the hedonometer as one or twoday dips but typically these are quickly drowned out by the background noise related to music sports and celebrities danforth says but with pandemicassociated lockdowns a major focus of peoples time and attention it makes sense for the signals of sadness to be prolonged although danforth and dodds were quick to declare this milestone in unhappiness other researchers are more reserved in their judgement “surely this is a very sad week” says munmun de choudhury a computer scientist at the georgia institute of technology in atlanta but the changing demographics of twitter users over time — as well as the changing ways that people use twitter — make it hard to say for sure whether it has been the platforms saddest and sorrow alone doesnt tell the whole story says desmond patton a social scientist at columbia university in new york city “its one thing to tell the world ‘this is the saddest week” he says “but also in the saddest week you have thousands and thousands of people who are now activated and moving towards equality and social justice” this mobilization too is captured in the hedonometer danforth says — the tweet volume over the past two weeks is nearly double the daily average from 2019 the strength and the duration of the signal are unique to this moment he says “both the pandemic and these protests have been far more cohesive in terms of collective attention than anything weve ever seen”|2020-06-15|-0.9929|negative|0.06480158730158729|positive
data and technology can help clarify customer behavior at the earliest stages of the decision journey herersquos how|a growing share of the marketing budget is managed according to the principles of targetedperformance marketing personalized messages direct impact measurement at the level of individual users neartime optimization and partial automation this is especially true for digital marketing activities that drive conversion and purchase but what about the media spend focused on the earlier stages of the consumers decision journey such as brand awareness including traditional media or “mid and upperfunnel” portions of digital marketing while these investments often account for more than fifty percent of the marketing budget they are managed with far less rigor than online spending this leads to an unclear understanding of performance and a tendency to rely on accepted wisdom or worse mid and upperfunnel spend in digital are held to the same performance metrics as the lowerfunnel performance often leading to a false or misleading understanding of the impact of spending as a result marketers often rely on their media agency to tell them what to do datadriven performance marketing however can now be applied much more effectively to branding and demandgeneration activities with a clearer understanding of consumer preferences and behavior at the early stages of their buying journey companies report marketing efficiency gains of up to thirty percent and incremental topline growth of up to ten percent without increasing the marketing budget on average the impact is significantly higher than that of established marketing roi mroi methods for branding activities this precision in branding is particularly crucial now as companies manage the effects of covid19 on the early stages of the consumers decision journey while much is still unknown we believe that datadriven performance marketing will give marketers an edge when it comes to reaching their target groups efficiently during and after the pandemic in a consumer survey conducted in the us in april 2020 respondents said they intend to watch more live news net intent 19 percent and read more news online 14 percent to stay up to date at the same time almost twenty percent of consumers have switched their “goto” brands due to covid19 as these habits evolve granular data analysis and disciplined marketingperformance management will be essential for brands to stay in touch with their customers and drive mroi marketers spend 560 billion annually on global advertising however standard crosschannel mroi approaches such as marketingmix modeling mmm and multitouch attribution modeling mta to track the effectiveness of that spend are often unsatisfactory due to the following • because they depend on historical data existing models are focused on the past • existing data sets are not sufficiently granular except for digital marketing • existing approaches struggle to account for the impact of message and creation • there is a gap between mroi measurement and marketing execution • most existing approaches do not support realtime optimization cfos are especially skeptical regarding the output of existing approaches in a recent mckinsey survey fortyfive percent of cfos said the reason marketing proposals had been declined or not fully funded in the past was that they didnt demonstrate a clear line to value and forty percent didnt think marketing investments should be protected during a downturn to overcome the limitations of standalone models and win over the skeptics in the csuite marketers often combine multiple tools such as mmm for budget sizing mta for digital marketing ab testing for inchannel optimization and surveys for brand performance while such efforts can help increase the validity of the overall outcome the integration is usually a manual process and continued efforts are necessary to maintain different approaches in parallel manage the interfaces ensure quality control and resolve potentially conflicting recommendations worse yet many marketers dont have full confidence in the integrated data and the insights derived from them it remains difficult to derive clear actionable recommendations for incampaign steering across touchpoints and funnel stages “increasingly it feels like were trying to solve tomorrows problems with yesterdays tools” a veteran marketer said recently in summing up the situation the massive improvements in datatracking technologies have made what we call “performance branding” a discipline that is as rigorous and successful as more mainstream performancemarketing practices as the ability to track shopper preferences improves however companies first need to establish and follow strict consumerconsent management approaches and tools to make sure the use of that data matches consumer expectations and is fully compliant with all relevant laws rules and regulations with these rules guidelines and governance procedures in place companies can use increasingly sophisticated data techniques to understand shoppers preferences across channels and devices they can now apply the principles of performance marketing to the early stages of the consumer decision journey and to traditional media b2c marketers in fact have said that datadriven marketing focusing on the individual is their number one priority according to a recent forecast investments in such solutions will triple from 900 million in two thousand and eighteen to 26 billion in 2022 examples of concrete advances include the following • media consumption increasingly the impact of traditional advertising can be measured and optimized at the individual or household level for example many smart tvs have a unique ip address and are equipped with automatic contentrecognition acr technology that lets them create a record of which ads have been viewed • “identity graphs” an identity graph is a collection of userlevel data combined with identifiers such as digital cookies physical addresses email accounts and mobile phone numbers this type of database enables advertisers to better understand consumer preferences and habits along their entire decision journey and across channels and devices • individuallevel transaction data in their efforts to understand and improve the impact of joint campaigns and promotions and also to monetize their data assets retailers increasingly provide access to individuallevel transaction data to manufacturers and advertisers by combining their own data about advertising exposure with these records advertisers can enrich their data sets to derive more reliable causeandeffect relations • personalization of consumer surveys and panel data in the past surveys generated insights about the average customer thanks to agile insights applications questionnaires can now be customized and individual responses can be matched with an existing individuallevel database • technological advances the increasing capacity for data storage faster it infrastructure and partial automations is allowing market researchers and data scientists to handle much larger sample sizes sophisticated algorithms can help companies understand individual customer behavior in real time as a result of these developments a larger part of the marketing budget can now be managed like a true investment rather than as a sunk cost benefits include the ability to compare spend impact across media analyze brand impact across a consumers entire decision journey including “upstream” exposures that may have driven awareness but didnt immediately drive a purchase allocate incampaign resources more effectively and tailor content we have also found that having this kind of unified view of the customer and clear view of the return on marketing spend provides an important bridge between the cmo and cfo this datadriven perspective on marketing performance allows both to develop more thoughtful and aligned strategies for marketing spend a telco player for example used a datadriven performancebranding approach to determine which brand interactions contributed to an individual users choices from tvad exposure and website searches to callcenter contacts and from acquisition to contract renewal by applying this approach to its entire customer base the company was able to increase brand consideration by twenty percent and marketingdriven gross adds by fifteen percent in another case a consumergoods company used mroi measurement to determine the optimal creative rotation across channels based on the output of the new mroi model the creative mix across selected channels was optimized resulting in a fourteen percent increase in advertising impact on sales one other often underappreciated benefit of performance branding and demand generation is that they help companies overcome the silo mentality of the past until recently different parts of the marketing organization used different data and tools to make their cases while digital marketers relied on attribution models to demonstrate the record returns generated by investments in searchengine marketing brand managers cited marketingmix models to make the case for a bigger tv budget performance branding in contrast serves as a single source of truth and it helps companies create synergies between different elements of the marketing mix such as online and offline or between investments in brand perception and sales stimulation “the new model has put an end to the bickering for the first time people are actually looking at the same data basis to figure out what is best for our brand and we all get to go home earlier that alone was worth the effort” says the cmo for a large retail bank core elements for getting performance branding right getting the full benefits of performance branding requires a fundamental shift in marketing practices toward greater precision and agility key

do you remember your first flight the first time you fell in love with a new city we do|we remember the first time we jumped in a cold lake on a hot summer day with our siblings the first time we ate street food walking the streets of a new country with college roommates we even remember the first business trip we took—straight out of college and too nervous to enjoy the ride this desire to build memories to connect with people and to see new places drove 14 billion of us to travel internationally in 2019 creating safer travel experiences is now paramount to protect this privilege now is clearly a moment of crisis for the travel industry available seat miles on us airlines were down seventyone percent in april two thousand and twenty from the previous year globally hotels are at twentynine percent occupancy compared with seventytwo percent over the same period in 2019 however we are seeing green shoots of demand in areas that are opening up highlighting an enduring desire to travel our april survey of chinese leisure travelers shows that many people are already planning their next trip but the future of the travel industry will depend on more than just travelers pentup demand for some the romance that travel used to inspire was already wearing thin even before the crisis we spoke to people across multiple geographies who have traveled in the last two months and the one constant across their experiences was added stress—whether due to limited entry points multiple new checkpoints or fellow travelers inconsistent compliance with published safety measures safety must be the first priority wherever possible however intensified health and hygiene protocols should be implemented in ways that avoid making journeys more difficult in the aftermath of the pandemic—for example the way that travel became logistically more complex after 911 because of additional security measures the imperative to move fast has often meant unilateral decision making rather than solutions developed through quick iterative feedback any further advance of cold or sterile experiences as a result of the appropriate pursuit of safety could radically shift behaviors toward simpler experiences such as choosing to drive instead fly or could even dampen the overall recovery travel companies need to excite and attract customers as well as reassure them to achieve this leaders should focus on making travel better—not just safer—which means giving travelers more control offering greater authenticity and personalization and taking a customercentric agile approach many travel companies have already announced a series of health and hygiene measures often promoted with wellknown cleaning brands or health experts but not all of these measures will survive in their current forms some wont be effective some wont resonate with travelers and some will prove impossible to deliver consistently and at scale constant oneupmanship on cleanliness though wellintentioned can be problematic for two reasons first each new announcement resets the bar on hygiene standards leaving industry players scrambling to keep up with initiatives—whether or not they actually improve employee or traveler safety second the travelers we interviewed told us that the fragmentation across new cleanliness programs creates anxiety and confusion about what works and who to trust to keep them safe if one airport claims that its security process is safer than anothers for example why would travelers trust that any airport is safe travelers should have confidence in the whole system rather than be anxious about pieces within it exhibit 1 in fact a focus on health and hygiene only scratches the surface of the changes that are necessary in the aftermath of the current crisis companies can consider three types of interventions to reinvent and reinvigorate travel over the coming years exhibit 2 in addition to tablestakes safety initiatives a second category of actions can reassure and comfort the public brands might differentiate themselves and reengage their travelers with visible communicationsbased cues—such as notifications about the health status of the destination city and personalized notes about the importance of testing and other safety measures finally companies need to move beyond reassuring customers to exciting them perhaps by looking for opportunities to create exceptional travel experiences making travel better not just safer as travel companies redesign their traveler experiences to address risks and anxieties related to covid19 they should remember that the pain points and trends that existed before the crisis—such as the shift toward a more digital and personalized journey and an increased emphasis on wellness and sustainability—have not gone away exhibit 3 airports for example are going to have to rethink customer experience in the coming years but many already understood the importance of improved service and contactless operations another example is the highanxiety purchase journey for flights and lodging meaningful purchases that often cannot be returned simplifying these experiences represents a significant opportunity before the crisis we estimated in partnership with the international air transport association that the value at stake in making airline ticket retail easier might be 40 billion —equivalent to four percent of two thousand and nineteen revenues—by 2030 many initiatives can make the travel experience simultaneously better and safer housekeeping services for instance will need to adjust for safety concerns but revised protocols can also reduce environmental impact such as through lessfrequent laundering of sheets during each stay decrease cost and give guests more flexibility by letting them choose their own housekeeping schedule companies will also need to look outside the industry to understand changing consumer expectations travelers develop preferences and needs based on their interactions with all companies not only when theyre on airplanes or in hotels companies should consider for example how travelers interact with grocerystore clerks fooddelivery persons or virtualshopping experts admittedly the current economic context makes it difficult to expect companies to do more indeed not every good idea will be economically feasible and theres little slack in the system for big launches that fail the good news is that some of the necessary changes will require no significant capital outlay but instead a change in mindset toward customer experience–centric behaviors where investment is needed developing a clear perspective on which actions to prioritize will require balancing of the travelers needs with consistent delivery perhaps with a smaller organization and the business cases viability travel companies should bear three principles in mind when designing new protocols and experiences companies should empower customers to build their own itinerary using smarter connected digital tools and make it easier for them to modify or cancel their plans in addition companies must recognize that the factors that promote customer loyalty may now have shifted nearterm uncertainty may mean for example that the ability to cancel a reservation matters more than brand choice or price the moments that matter might mean more digital than ever and in new places within the customer journey solutions and policies that provide choice and control will help to build the trust and confidence necessary to get travelers back on the road and in the air be human and genuine and personalize the experience before the crisis personalized and unique experiences constituted a dominant trend boutique hotels for instance were the fastestgrowing hotel segment in the united states with supply increasing 106 percent between two thousand and eighteen and 2019 compared with an overall hotel supply growth of 20 percent travelers are drawn to those hotels that put a human face on the institution that can combine the high standards and consistency of a hotel chain with the personality and privacy of a vacation rental major hotel chains have recognized these changing preferences and launched new “soft brands” that serve as a collection of boutique hotels travel companies now have an opportunity to take this personalization a step further but—in a world where formerly welcoming smiles are behind masks—they will need to find new ways to connect we have heard hotel staff calling first responders who were quarantining in their hotels to check on them and including notes of encouragement in their bagged lunches and of airline pilots addressing passengers preflight to reassure them and answer any questions about safety getting this right is a balance mass emails from the ceo can only go so far and consumers are already reporting fatigue around “were all in this together” messaging that is beginning to ring hollow according to a recent adobe study brand marketers are twenty percent more likely than consumers to believe that consumers want to see ads on companies covid19 responses the bar for authenticity in brand communication and behavior across channels including in person must remain high as such communication should be focused on what a company is doing for the traveler rather than delivering superficial platitudes frontline staff can also be powerful messengers and are a great source of insight for improvements or opportunities that a home office will not spot as quickly travel workers have been through a lot since the start of the crisis both professionally and personally and maintaining an open dialogue around their experiences—and acting upon their feedback—will be vital to

airport in three consecutive shipments from ten to twelve june the cargo includes a variety of health kits ranging between trauma kits sufficient to manage 4300 cases as well as eleven cholera kits thirty noncommunicable diseases kits twentysix surgical kits and four hundred and seventyeight interagency emergency health kits providing medicines medical supplies and consumables enough to treat over one million cases turning to colombia the who said there are nearly 49000 confirmed cases of covid19 with nearly 1600 deaths the un team in coordination with the un mission in the country prepared a 303 million strategy focusing on health improving livelihoods and protecting vulnerable communities the international organization for migration iom unfpa and who are working with authorities to deliver protective equipment to health centres hiring epidemiological surveillance staff and other health personnel and support to maintain sexual and reproductive healthcare services for its part the un development programme undp is supporting small and mediumsized businesses to continue providing jobs and keep up the food production the un team has also focused on consulting and supporting indigenous organizations to prevent the spread of the virus with an assessment mission in the amazon and un‑women is also currently implementing an initiative to tackle domestic violence and genderbased violence with local authorities today the director general of the international atomic energy agency iaea rafael mariano grossi launched an initiative to strengthen global preparedness for future pandemics like covid19 the project is called zodiac it builds on iaeas experience in assisting countries in the use of nuclear and nuclearderived techniques for the rapid detection of pathogens that cause transboundary animal diseases including ones that spread to humans these zoonotic diseases kill around 27 million people every year the project will establish a global network to help national laboratories in monitoring surveillance early detection and control of animal and zoonotic diseases such as covid19 ebola avian influenza and zika also today mr grossi addressed the first virtual meeting of the iaeas board of governors he said that despite the lockdown iaea continues to carry out all of its most timecritical infield nuclear verification work on the desert locust infestation in pakistan that we were asked about on friday farmers have already been significantly affected with further damage expected at the end of the summer the food and agriculture organization fao is providing technical advice and support to the government for locust surveillance and control fao and the world food programme wfp together with our partners and in coordination with the government will assess needs in the worsthit districts which have also experienced other problems over the past eighteen months including drought flash flooding a cold wave and covid19 the government of pakistan needs 372 million over the coming three years in additional funding to survey control and recover from the locust damage more than three million people in pakistan are facing severe acute food insecurity with the situation particularly precarious in balochistan today is world elder abuse awareness day according to estimates from the world health organization who one in six people aged over sixty suffers from abuse this represents nearly one hundred and fortyone million people globally this number might also be much higher as elder abuse is one of the most concealed and underreported violations this year the theme of the date is the impact of covid19 on violence abuse and neglect of older persons in may the secretarygeneral launched a policy brief on the impact of covid19 on older persons he warned that measures to restrict movement may trigger a greater incidence of violence against older persons and all types of abuse such as physical emotional financial and sexual as well as neglect i have a couple of personnel announcements for you the secretarygeneral is appointing major general kefyalew amde tessema of ethiopia as force commander for the united

googles official digital marketing publication discover three immediate strategies brands can take to make the industry more equitable|nathan young is a group strategy director at the minneapolis agency periscope and the coauthor of an demanding ad agency leaders take action to end systemic racism within the industry the letter has been signed by more than who represent nearly every major agency in the us here he outlines the immediate steps brands can take to make the industry more equitable sparked by a rise in public solidarity with the black lives matter movement brands are facing growing pressure to act consumers and employees are demanding accountability on systemic racism initially marketers responded by issuing statements social media posts and ads thinking theyd be able to recycle the relatively successful playbook they developed for the covid19 pandemic but the pushback from consumers was forceful and clear they wanted to see meaningful action from brands on the issue of race according to a june two thousand and twenty poll from edelman 60 of americans would now boycott or switch to a brand depending on its response to this hot button issue that number jumps to 70 when asked of the key 18 to34yearold demographic1 those findings underscore the sense of urgency this moment has rendered of course rooting out systemic racism is a collective effort that wont be solved overnight but there are three actions brands can take right now to enact meaningful change have the talk with your teams a predominant theme has emerged in conversations with the more than six hundred black ad industry professionals who signed our letter leadership isnt listening there has been a tendency among leadership in both brands and agencies to solve for diversity from the boardroom we have tried that approach for decades now and — lets be honest — it hasnt worked this moment is a stern reminder of the perils of topdown management ideas that sound great on paper can be disastrous in practice and if you arent talking to your employees you will miss the failure leadership has pointed to a “lack of pipeline” or a “restricted talent pool” as the reason behind stalled diversity and inclusion efforts but if they took a moment to ask black or nonblack people of color nbpoc employees how they feel theyd uncover the harsh truth at the heart of the matter we dont feel valued many black agency employees have relayed to us that as a result of our  leadership reached out to them to talk for the first time in their careers shocking as that may seem it is depressingly common for black employees leadership tends to keep employees who are black or from underrepresented groups at a distance and avoids having direct conversations about race presumably out of fear of legal retaliation or an unwillingness to be uncomfortable but avoiding direct conversations with your staff will only lead to an exodus of underrepresented talent|2020-06-15|-0.9675|negative|0.083687641723356|positive
the covid19 pandemic has resulted in school closures and distancing requirements that have disrupted both work and family life for many concerns exist that these disruptions caused by the pandemic may not have influenced men and women researchers equally m…|we repeat the reviewers points here in italic and include our replies point by point as well as a description of the changes made in roman we want to thank the editor and the reviewers for their excellent comments and suggestions we have gone over them all and made changes accordingly most importantly some of the comments have caused an update of the data set which changes some of the findings and allows us to finetune the analysis since we initially harvested data in april 2020 pubmed has changed its interface and now provides better and more consistent information on author affiliations this allows a much more precise analysis of author country as requested by one of the reviewers this was not possible previously we address this data update in the paper in an effort to be as transparent about the process as possible but for good measure we would like to mention here the original sample which was 9050 covid19 papers of which 1179 had gender for first and last author and at least one usbased author these numbers are now 15839 and 1893 respectively when analyzing firstauthors we restrict to usbased first authors and vice versa for last authors below we list the comments from the reviewers and editor in italics and our responses in regular font face we have uploaded the data and the analytical scripts to osf the project is private right now but we will make it public whenif our paper is published an r script is provided which will allow full analysis from the most raw data set we are able to provide gender is inferred and information from pubmed is extracted into a table 2 the robustness of author gender determination is not clear and the methods should be described in more depth for example the text states gender was reliably estimated for 819 of the entire sample what does reliably estimated mean here how is the accuracy of the gender estimation tool established what is the likelihood that a given gender was determined correctly doing spot checks of a random sample of authors can be helpful additionally adding more information on the specific methods used for inferring gender from author names would be useful checking the correctness of gender assignment is of course important our data relies on an algorithm which we have previously used and checked for robustness we realize that this was not apparent from the very short comment in the paper and have added a little more detail about which algorithm we used and that robustness checks have previously been performed we have adjusted the method so that we now only compare us first and last authors we believe this is a strength of the study because it allows us to isolate the effect to a single country and the timing of both disease and social constraints for the analysis of the full author group there could potentially be a bias which we address in the limitations 4 i am not convinced by the authors argument that the observed differences are not due to a specialty bias by looking at covid19specific papers only they are looking at the gender distribution of authors in a specific field and comparing them to the gender distribution of authors in a variety of other fields who happen to publish in similar journals it is entirely possible that there is a gender bias in coronavirus research for example this would not be captured by journal specialty but would be seen in gender proportions for covid19 papers please add additional columns to table one looking at all research published in these journals in two thousand and twenty not just covid19related research andor discuss at greater length the possibility of specialty bias in your results while this is certainly an important point we also have to disagree for two reasons covid19 specific papers are not from a specific field on the contrary the vast majority of medical specialties have picked up research on covid19 in one way or another the search for cures or vaccines are likely limited but discussions about implications for treatment of other diseases span all of clinical medicine secondly our reason for using covid19 research as the “treatment” case was not to look specifically into this but rather to have a sample of papers where we knew the research would have to be done in 2020 if we introduced a new column of “other” two thousand and twenty papers from the same journals it would be impossible to know which of these had been in the pipeline since two thousand and nineteen or earlier and which were actually based on research from 2020 5 the authors limited their samples to papers with at least one us author it could be useful to know of the one thousand one hundred and seventynine papers in the treatment group how many papers had more than one us author im concerned that this limitation may introduce confounding factors knowing how many of these papers were published by teams of scientists primarily working in the us vs a single scientist working in the us with a larger international team would address this concern and more strongly support the authors point that the disparity in female authorship can be potentially linked to the social restrictions in the us we hope that the changes to how we analyze first and last authors analysis of firstlast author gender restricted to firstlast authors from the us also addresses this point for the share of women in the full group this remains a valid concern but not one we are currently able to address while pubmed has now introduced perauthor affiliations it is not realistic to use these to make statistical analyses when we claim to look only at papers with usauthors this is really a conservative claim there are certainly more papers with us addresses but where the country or state is not included in the affiliation or included in nonstandardized forms our database contains more than sixty thousand “countries” from the affiliations as there is no standard formatting of pubmed affiliations we have trawled all of these for combinations of “usa” “united states” “america” state names names of major cities etc to find the most complete set of affiliations related to the usa however we are not able to provide a reliable estimate of the national distribution of affiliations of all

how can european companies best prevent measures intended to control the covid19 pandemic from also undermining data privacy and security|as the coronavirus pandemic takes its terrible toll in both human life and livelihoods governments publichealth authorities companies and individuals have responded with extraordinary measures to protect the health of people governments and institutions put in place restrictions on movement and mechanisms for health tracking and reporting these mechanisms including contacttracing and selfreporting apps some recording and transmitting personal health information underscore the deepening importance of data protection and privacy in this crisis with the advent of the european general data protection regulation gdpr in two thousand and eighteen and the possible “eprivacy regulation” companies and institutions have increased their data awareness these new regulations enforce stricter rules on privacy and data protection setting new standards in the words of the gdpr for the “rights and freedoms of data subjects” around the globe during the pandemic government authorities and companies have had to balance two priorities—protecting public health and protecting personal privacy some measures designed to limit the spread of the virus and potentially save lives could also have serious humanrights implications while many publichealth measures do not require data collection others could encroach upon the protections that protect individuals personal data government officials and companies can find themselves on the horns of a dilemma so to speak contemplating measures to reduce the spread of the virus that could meanwhile drastically curtail the rights and freedoms of the people whose lives they seek to protect the following discussion draws on the recent european experience of this public health–personal privacy dilemma events continue to move quickly and our analysis reflects experience at a particular point in time may 2020 in the history of the pandemic the primary focus for public authorities and the private sector is to control the disease the protection of human life is the allimportant foundation for any further steps taken to return to normalcy to this end healthcare systems including personnel facilities tests and necessary equipment including ventilators and personal protective equipment or ppe must be secured and expanded as needed state budgets have been vastly expanded to address extraordinary demands the measures introduced to limit the reach of the virus have affected personal freedom in three basic areas • limits on personal movement including physical distancing restrictions on public gatherings quarantine isolation and lockdown • health tracking including manual and automated tracking and contacttracing mechanisms mobilephone tracking and applications by both states and private companies many of the protective measures governments are taking in these areas are well understood and supported by the affected populations concerns are being raised however about their intrusiveness on personal privacy and implications for the future government officials and corporateprivacy officers struggle with balancing protection measures and privacy safeguards often without clear guidance from regulators in the private sector corporate boards and top management have tended not to prioritize privacy aspects in the fight against the virus beyond the risks posed in the handling and processing of personal data systemic cyberrisks are posed in the covid19 working environment with workplaces closed and employees working from home the it departments of public institutions and companies have had to set up remote operations rapidly many people are now using unsecured devices and internet communications with lower protection levels than those maintained in corporate or institutional networks the performance of network infrastructure being deployed is potentially weaker and less subject to human control and support from other employees increased system stress and gaps in collaborative tools have led to increased vulnerability as witnessed in numerous reports of higher levels of cyberattacks including malwarelaced email phishing scammers posing as corporate help desks and malware in covid19 information sites the threats are all designed to take advantage of remote working arrangements in place since the beginning of the pandemic lockdowns like public and private organizations regulators too were unprepared for the covid19 crisis after a period of adjustment however they are now providing guidance and clarification on how to interpret existing legislation in the crisis environment with particular attention to healthrelated protective measures introduced or being considered by companies the gdpr is considered by experts to be one of the worlds strictest privacy regulations the consensus among european regulators and the european data protection supervisor is that the current crisis does not nullify the gdpr but that its rules are flexible enough to accommodate the emergency measures while keeping in place adequate safeguards according to the gdpr for example national governments are permitted to act in the public interest but must limit the data they use a few principles advanced in the gdpr are important in this respect the regulation requires “data minimization” and “purpose limitation” these two guidelines specify that as little personal data as necessary should be used and for a specific narrow purpose only—in this case to limit the spread of the virus and protect employees health transparency is also required meaning that affected individuals must be informed about the usage of their data in simple clear language a further principle is protection data must be sufficiently protected both technically against cyberrisk and organizationally against unauthorized sharing to help companies understand the dataprotection rules many european regulators have issued guidance on specific health measures this guidance mostly addresses situations for which consent is not a practical consideration such as notifying the specific employees who have worked in close proximity to an infected person the guidance also varies slightly from country to country depending on national legislation related to health labor and social security and their varying interpretations we have identified common guardrails around the three types of control measures listed above the following considerations are however subject to further assessment on a casebycase basis according to national laws and pertinent legal guidance the discussions in this article are not intended to give such legal guidance the limits on personal movement imposed by public authorities in the crisis are not usually addressed in dataprotection laws such limits are intrusive of peoples rights and freedoms however and may even be subject to other laws employer mandates for working from home likewise fall outside dataprotection laws as has been emphasized by several european dataprotection authorities entrance controls at places of employment can however present dataprotection issues in the view of many regulators employees returning to work could be required to disclose travel information in connection with publichealth concerns if they have been to a highrisk area appropriate action such as temporary quarantining can be mandated regulators have expressed concern over temperature taking and personal health surveys both swedish and belgian dataprotection authorities for example do not consider the measurement of body temperature to fall under the gdpr unless the results are recorded but other regulators have specifically forbidden regular temperature taking according to the gdpr and other european regulations employers are generally not permitted to collect health data from employees and visitors except when legally obligated to do so whether to protect the interests of the workforce or the public or to comply with employment law or other national laws where the exceptions apply data processing must be strictly limited according to the principles of data minimization purpose limitation transparency and data protection employers are only permitted to collect as few data as necessary for a specific purpose they must inform the individuals concerned about data processing and ensure that the data are appropriately protected the processing must be documented and it must also be stopped as soon as it is no longer needed employers are not permitted generally to provide employees with the names of colleagues who have fallen ill apart from notifying a narrow list of those with whom they have had close contact the gdpr also limits the right to ask for employees private phone numbers except for specific reasons such as to inform individuals of work rules and other information relating to the covid19 pandemic in accordance with gdpr principles furthermore usage of data of vulnerable individuals in higherrisk groups should be limited to specific purposes such as home deliveries of vital supplies the gdpr puts certain privacy and data protections in place that limit the possible healthtracking measures which countries may use in the covid19 crisis european dataprotection authorities have however permitted deployment of national tracking systems as long as they are aligned with gdpr principles the systems must be voluntary and consensual or fully anonymized as when a telecommunications operator supplies authorities with anonymous data for measuring population movement more precise personal monitoring systems such as those utilized in south korea or china to contain the spread of the pandemic are not permitted under the gdpr in the pandemic it departments have faced completely new challenges as entire workforces were sent home to work remotely companies must now maintain the security of their systems software and data|2020-06-15|0.8743|positive|0.03263132281588658|positive

nonviolent activists who are detained and accused of being terrorists simply because they reject injustice and belong to regions that “enrage” authorities a human rights lawyer told the security council in a sixteen june videoconference meeting “there are thousands of innocent women and children in detention centres hundreds of mothers arrested with their children and children born inside detention centres” noura ghazi told the council in an impassioned appeal to distinguish them from those who commit terrorist acts they did not interfere in any act against the authorities some have been taken hostage due to the activism of relatives who oppose the regime “does anyone here believe that there is a political system that hates and gets angry at a certain region” she asked she questioned whether her briefing to the council would genuinely help resolve the issue of detainees and forcibly disappeared in syria or instead be used as a tool to highlight the human face of the international community which has failed to advocate for humanitarian issues despite the hard price she has paid in her life she does not have a personal attitude towards any one person or party “hatred has no place in human rights work” she said a point her opponents do not understand rather she said that she is here to address an ethical and humanitarian issue the suffering of tens of thousands of families of missing forcibly disappeared and detained syrians particularly women the enforced disappearance of men has left women alone to care for their families and fight to understand the truth behind the absence of their loved ones as a founder of the “families for freedom” movement she works with nophotozone to promote nondiscrimination against the families of detainees and the forcibly disappeared on any political basis or on the basis of the party that has arrested or hidden their loved ones “we want our loved ones we want justice” she said “and the beginning of knowing the truth will lead us to it” the reason such suffering persists is the absence of international political will to stop it she said tens of thousands of syrians have been detained forcibly disappeared or gone missing since the outbreak of protests in march two thousand and eleven demanding the release of detainees “we were met with killing and arrest” she said — so much so that today “we become unable now to count the number of our victims and the names of our opponents who violate our rights every day” she pressed the council to review development indicators in syria before 2011 she rejected prisoner exchanges as “nothing but blackmail” as the people she represents do not belong to any of them they are not prisoners of war they are arbitrarily detained persons “the central government uses them as leverage and for achieving gains” she said “we want a radical comprehensive and fair solution for all the detainees and disappeared in syria not only for a part of them” accusing syrias government of violating international and syrian law she asked the council to consider whether the military field court and terrorism court violate the principles of fair trial whether summary executions constitute a flagrant violation of human and prisoners rights and whether torture is a crime in all laws and under all circumstances “we are the protectors of the constitution” she said “our weapon is the law and our opponent violates the law” their demands are simple and clear she said the application of laws and accountability for those who violate them “should we have to submit to injustice and tyranny in order not to be called as traitors” she wondered “we are a people who belong to our state … and defend it against a security political system that robs the country every day” in closing she drew attention to the arrest on fifteen june of ten activists in sweida who belong to a minority that syrias government claims to protect but whom it cannot accuse of being terrorists against this backdrop geir pedersen special envoy for syria said he had heard the deepening concerns expressed by the civil society support room and the womens advisory board about the future of their beloved country and broader appeals for progress on the “2254 political process” ending the violence and on the issue of detainees abductees and missing persons “i reiterate my appeal for the syrian government — and all other syrian parties — to carry out largescale and unilateral releases of detainees and abductees” he said “and for more meaningful actions on missing persons” in addition he had heard a new level of alarm over the dramatic collapse in economic conditions throughout syria from damascus and the southwest to aleppo and the northwest and within the northeast food prices have skyrocketed and supply chains have been disrupted the purchasing power of ordinary syrians has seriously diminished as wages — both private and public sector — are vastly inadequate to meet the demands of the day he warned before this deterioration more than eighty per cent of syrians were estimated to be living below the poverty line he said today the world food programme estimates that 93 million people are food insecure with two million more at risk — a fortytwo per cent rise over 2019 syrians have expressed panic about shops and pharmacies forced to close jobs lost and remittances drying up further he said sanctions imposed by the united states and european union against people and entities affiliated with the government have restricted financial banking oil and gas and military activities as well as exports and multilateral lending secondary sanctions by the united states — foreshadowed since the passage of legislation six months ago — will enter into force as early as seventeen june some syrians have taken peacefully to the streets in sweida daraa and idlib protesting a range of grievances on the security front he expressed concern over incidents in tafas in the southwest as broader geopolitical tensions there appear to be growing and islamic state of iraq and the levant isildaesh remains active in the south in the northwest he welcomed the calm brought about by the russian federation and turkey but cited a worrying increase in mutual shelling reports of reinforcements on both sides and the first reported progovernment air strikes in three months noting that a crossline attack by the waharid almuminin operations room killed several syrian soldiers last week he said that while two of its leaders were subsequently killed in a united states drone strike on fourteen june it and other small extremist factions have formed a new operations room he was assured that the russian federation and turkey are working to contain the situation more broadly he called for calm to be sustained in idlib and for a nationwide ceasefire to be upheld in line with resolution two thousand two hundred and fiftyfour 2015 the challenge posed by listed terrorist groups must be addressed through a cooperative and targeted approach that safeguards stability protects civilians and fully respects international humanitarian law the same is true for efforts to prevent an isildaesh resurgence in and around the central desert on the political front he said he is ready to convene and facilitate a third session of the syrianled and syrianowned constitutional committee in geneva perhaps at the end of august but syrian parties will face great difficulties in resolving problems without real diplomacy among the key international players with influence as there are still five international armies operating across the country he recalled among whom there are “real and substantive differences” as there are between the syrian parties he said these differences have been laid bare in debates over sanctions and in competing assessments of the political will to resolve the conflict “they need to be the subject of real discussion and diplomacy” he said stressing that mutual and reciprocal steps are needed to unlock progress he also emphasized the importance of full sustained and unimpeded humanitarian access using all modalities what is required is the readiness of all to deal seriously with the realities of the conflict he asserted in the ensuing dialogue council members broadly called for determined action on the issue of detainees and missing persons with most expressing support for the syrianled and owned political process and welcoming that the constitutional committee could potentially hold its third round in geneva in august the representative of the united states called on the assad regime to immediately release civilians being held in crowded detention centres equally important is progress on the constitutional committee whose stakeholders have agreed on the agenda but not convened due to the cochairs unwillingness to do so virtually she condemned air strikes by syria and the russian federation which caused the largest disruption of the idlib ceasefire since its establishment on five march as well as provocations by terrorists on the ground urging moscow and damascus to commit to a nationwide ceasefire the united states is committed to reaching a political solution to the conflict and rejects attempts by the assad regime and its allies to use military force obstruction or disinformation to bypass united nations efforts to restore peace she said the assad regime has a clear choice pursue the political path outlined in resolution two thousand two hundred and fiftyfour 2015 or leave the united states with no choice other than to withhold reconstruction funding and impose sanctions against the regime and its political backers on ten july the council will debate the mandate renewal for the humanitarian crossborder mechanism in resolution two thousand five hundred and four 2020 and she cautioned against

the reviewer suggests we do not expect this to make a difference to hcv replication but we have not managed to test this we have therefore not been able to further study the role of pkr in distinguishing hcv permissivity of huh7 and 75 we believe that this omission does not impact the conclusions in the manuscript we have reiterated that the differences between huh7 and 75 cells are multifactorial with the following text “furthermore our results suggest that a deficiency in pkrdependent responses as well as defective rigi sumpter et al 2005 may contribute to huh75 cell permissivity for hcv replication which is consistent with previous observations showing that rigi does not play a role binder et al 2007 indeed differences in permissivity between huh7 and huh75 cells are likely governed by a combination of factors including rigi sumpter et al 2005 and cd81 koutsoudakis et al 2007 among others” we did overexpress pkr in huh75 cells which inhibited hcv replication however we observed that overexpressed pkr was highly active autophosphorylated even in the absence of a stimulus which does not accurately recapitulate the situation in unmodified cells eg huh7 cells figure 7—figure supplement 2a where pkr is normally inactive unphosphorylated until a stimulus is added thus we have not included these particular data in the manuscript as we believe this would complicate the story without affecting our conclusions about the cypi mechanism moreover these data are similar to those we obtain in the huh7 pkr ko cells author response image 1 which we have included we have also discussed the issue of overexpressed pkr being constitutively active as relates to these data we thank the reviewer for this important comment the question of reexpression of pkr in the knockout lines is one we had considered in the original study we did not test this because we expected that pkr overexpression would induce translation shutdown as has been described previously eg grolleau et al 2000 and would confound our results nonetheless we have now stably overexpressed pkr in huh7 pkr ko cells and evaluated hcv replication and its sensitivity to csa inhibition overexpressed pkr was highly active as shown by its robust autophosphorylation even in the absence of a stimulus western blot in new figure 7—figure supplement 2 we found that pkr expression had an inhibitory effect on hcv replication possibly through suppression of host and viral translation as evidenced by the autophosphorylation of overexpressed pkr for this reason this experiment does not strictly recapitulate the situation in huh7 cells that is the overexpressed pkr is already phosphorylated and activated see figure 7—figure supplement 2 instead of unphosphorylated as in huh7 cells therefore while pkr overexpression reduced hcv replication it did not affect hcv sensitivity to csa we propose that overexpressed pkr cannot enhance csa sensitivity because pkr is already activated and suppressing hcv replication independently of csainduced antiviral signaling we had hoped to examine this further but did not have time before the covid19 closure of the lab these data are now shown in figure 7—figure supplement 2 and we have added the following text “we also sought to confirm the role of pkr in cypi activity by overexpressing pkr in huh7 pkr knockout cells however pkr overexpression in itself led to pkr activation as evidenced by its autophosphorylation figure 7—figure supplement 2a … this is consistent with previous observations of translation shutdown on pkr overexpression grolleau et al 2000 barber et al 1993 chong et al 1992 thomis and samuel 1992” in the manuscript originally figure 6d now figure 7d we observed highly similar results in two pkr ko clones which were prepared by singlecell cloning furthermore treatment of cells with a pkr inhibitor originally figure 6g now figure 7g led to the same phenotype we also have more new c16 data supporting a role for pkr figure 7g thus while the pkr reconstitution experiment did not yield clear results we propose that together these data are sufficiently compelling as described above pkr overexpression does not accurately recapitulate the situation in naïve cells in that overexpressed pkr is highly active autophosphorylated even in the absence of a stimulus this makes it difficult to evaluate the effect on the sensitivity of hcv to cypi which we propose relies on more subtle pkrmediated activation of irf1 in the absence of translation shutoff we have instead focused on an alternative approach to provide further evidence for a role for pkr using the pkr inhibitor c16 figure 7g this is a very helpful suggestion we have now compared the effect of the c16 pkr inhibitor in huh7 and huh7 knocked out for pkr the result was as expected and pkr knockout prevents the effect of c16 on csa sensitivity these new data are included as figure 7g we have added the following to the text “c16 decreased csa potency in huh7 cells but not in huh7 pkr ko cells figure 7g and only minimally affected csa potency against hcv in huh75 cells figure 7—figure supplement 1” this is another important point we have now evaluated the antiviral activities of daclatasvir ns5a inhibitor and telaprevir ns34a protease inhibitor in huh7 and huh7 pkr ko cells as expected the presence or absence of pkr did not affect hcv sensitivity to these other inhibitors these data are now shown in figure 7—figure supplement 3 we have added the following text “we next tested whether the absence of pkr broadly affects the sensitivity of hcv to the antiviral activity of telaprevir ns34a protease inhibitor and daclatasvir ns5a inhibitor in huh7 and huh7 pkr ko cells … collectively these data are consistent with a specific role for pkr in the enhanced antiviral activity of cypi in huh7 cells” we have now restructured the manuscript to present the ifnβruxolitinib data earlier in what is now figure 4 we have also sought to clarify that the observed phenotype is not dependent on ifnβ signalling and ifn induced gene expression but is rather a cellintrinsic response ie gene expression dependent on pkrirf1 activation with ifnβ being one of many antiviral genes induced upon cypi treatment of huh7 but not huh75 cells we now show the activation of other antiviral genes which are predominantly irf1dependent in figure 4 to confirm that the effect is not mediated by ifn we performed further experiments using an interferon receptor ifnar blocking antibody as for ruxolitinib ifnar blockade did not affect the cypi potency against hcv although it did rescue hcv replication from the inhibitory effect of ifn this data is presented in figure 4—figure supplement 3 we have added the following text “the notion that ifn was not required for maximal cypi activity was also supported by an experiment using antihuman interferon alphabeta receptor chain two antibody ifnar to inhibit ifn activity through receptor blockade … however in vivo ifn induction would be expected to influence hcv replication and adaptive immune responses and thus the antiviral activity of cypi in patients” unfortunately we did not manage to complete this experiment before our qpcr machine was requisitioned for covid19 testing outside ucl nonetheless rlrmavsdependent antiviral responses have previously been documented in huh7 cells and we have now cited these studies more prominently we have added new text reiterating this point “huh7 cells are capable of responding to cytosolic rna and initiating antiviral signalling through rigi mavs and irf3 sumpter et al 2005 binder et al 2007 … therefore we first hypothesized that the active rigi pathway in huh7 cells contributes to the antiviral signalling induced by cypi” we thank the reviewer for this suggestion we attempted to evaluate replication of the con1 genotype 1b replicon lohmann et al two thousand and three j virol 77 30073019 despite significant effort we were unable to get the con1 replicon to replicate in our huh7 and huh75 cells in the past month we obtained the huh7lunet cell line which better supports con1 replication we were able to observe weak replication in huh7lunet cells but ran out of time before the covid19 lab closure and were unable to evaluate the effect of cypa depletion or cypi treatment in the presence or absence of pkr in the huh7lunet cell line importantly kaul et al 2009 evaluated replication of the con1 replicon in cypadepleted huh7lunet cells and huh75 cells cypa depletion in huh7lunet cells profoundly inhibited hcv replication by approximately three logs at fortyeight hours and had a lesser impact in huh75 cells kaul et al 2009 figure 2b these data suggest that our findings are relevant for other hcv genotypes and we now cite this study to make this point in the discussion as follows “notably a differential requirement for cypa in huh7lunet and huh75 cells has also been observed for replication of genotype 1b con1 and genotype 2a jfh1 replicons kaul et al 2009 suggesting that these mechanisms are consistent across hcv genotypes” we agree with the reviewer that we had overgeneralized our conclusions and in fact the mechanisms we have identified here may or may not be applicable to other viruses to address this concern we have limited our discussion in the current manuscript to hcv with the exception of where we have cited literature describing other viruses and cypa we thank the reviewer for pointing out this lack of clarity in our discussion this was partly

standby agreements for major capital projects can help preserve relationships as well as shore up suppliersrsquo and contractorsrsquo solvency during construction standstills|since the start of the year major infrastructure project leaders have been grappling with covid19 issues that jeopardize many of their most basic strategic operational and financial project assumptions sponsors contractors lenders and governments may be tempted to make shortterm decisions—such as dismissing claims for extra time summarily and withholding payment for partial milestone completion—that could compound the issues in the long term rather than solve them in this interview david metzger head of clifford chances global construction group and coronavirus advisory group discusses how negotiation and collaboration among stakeholders can help mitigate or even preempt disputes that otherwise could impair or prevent project recovery once the crisis eases mckinsey what challenges has the covid19 crisis created for project stakeholders and eventual project restart david metzger even the most sophisticated contracts are not designed to ensure the sort of stakeholder alignment that will be required when we emerge from the covid19 crisis conventional contract language and claims management are not well suited to the uncertainty we are seeing since project owners and financiers cant accurately revise programs and models when construction and the global supply chain come to a halt it puts many contractors and suppliers at risk of not just missing milestones and delivery targets but going out of business entirely every stakeholder faces risks from revenue delays time and cost overruns reduced cash flow and default and termination precipitous action by any stakeholder could result in not just project defaults but longterm disputes and relationship issues the more complicated the project the more difficult it is to have open conversations with the full breadth of stakeholders to ensure that all parties are ready to restart the project smoothly when covid19 restrictions end and in many cases it is clear that the impact will stretch far beyond any formal site or facility shutdown because of supply bottlenecks for key equipment and plant missed weather windows and ongoing distancing and health restrictions—meaning few projects will pick up right where they left off without additional complications mckinsey how can project stakeholders mitigate such risks david metzger project stakeholders must recognize that it is in everyones best interest to work together with the primary goal of ensuring the project can continue with minimal additional delay as restrictions related to covid19 are progressively lifted this may seem counterintuitive to those accustomed to defending their own interests first however the wider picture is that what often starts as a protective notice of possible force majeure can broaden into alternative concurrent claims for force majeure variations owner default such as due to delays on other contracts change in law or project suspension parties can redefine this narrative by creating standby arrangements designed to take the worstcase scenario—that is contract terminations—out of the equation and enable a framework for speedy recovery these arrangements will require everyone to recognize they have skin in the game and to be willing to put something in or at the least to minimize incentive to collapse a structure the heart of most standby arrangements is a fixed period during which a mutually agreed set of activities are understood to have been suspended and not subject to further claims for example the agreement may acknowledge a standstill of onsite construction but a continuation of design development which can be performed remotely such agreements create the necessary certainty for structuring reliefs and remodeling the project while allowing for earlier restarts when possible they can also avoid delay and suspension periods accruing to termination rights enable collaborative planning for efficient remobilization and shift some of the financial risk away from contractors and suppliers one international project developer has implemented standby agreements across several renewable energy projects to avoid disputes affecting the second half of 2020 mckinsey why might project owners and lenders consider taking on financial risks currently allocated to contractors and suppliers david metzger the pandemic is blind to whom it affects and as mentioned force majeure–type claims can quickly turn into broader disputes moreover if a supplier or contractor becomes insolvent or a contact must be terminated the added cost delay and risk to a project will likely be costlier than the concessions to extend time or to help them stay afloat and be ready for project restart for example parties can discuss partial payment of milestones while work is halted as well as who should bear which remobilization costs mckinsey what are the obstacles to implementing a standby agreement david metzger the biggest obstacle is that a standby agreement requires all parties to sign on this may be not just a question of lender approvals it may also for example require recognition of relief from a power offtaker concessional authority or equivalent settlements with subcontractors if the project is public or due to a public–private partnership ppp the complications are generally greater the reliefs available in ppp structures—for example changes in law—are usually much more limited than in privatesector contracts and some public authorities may be too constrained to show the necessary flexibility for these agreements to happen whether due to financial limitations procurement law or audit controls for example we have seen some governments act as helpful promoters for such arrangements showing flexibility and helping mitigate project risks but we have also seen some governments unconsciously delaying resolutions whether because resources are prioritized elsewhere or because of a desire to extract some benefit for the government or the taxpayer especially in countries badly impacted by the fall in oil prices development finance institutions and export credit agencies may assist as interlocutors in such situations though the political dynamics can vary for example multilaterals may feel obligated to assist not just the project but the country the dynamics of who should be managing standby agreement discussions for very highly leveraged projects can also be particularly challenging as the consequences may be particularly severe for equity this is where the “partnerships” component of ppps should be at the fore and a combined debt and equity approach is justified—but can again be lost by isolationist or defensive thinking|2020-06-16|0.9937|positive|0.08515626710454297|positive

as lockdowns begin to loosen resources need to be directed with care to aide european economic recovery post covid19|this article was a collaborative effort by david chinn pal erik sjatil sebastian stern sahil tesfu and eckart windhagen the lockdowns european countries imposed when the covid19 pandemic hit have caused supplyanddemand shocks in all industry sectors in response governments have launched lifeboats such as loan guarantees and value transfers which include income support and exceptions to socialsecurity contributions loan guarantees form the backbone of fiscal measures in europe accounting for at least sixtynine percent in each of the five largest economies exhibit 1 while the measures are unprecedented in scale so is the value at stake according to the mckinsey global institute the difference between a weak and strong recovery in the eurozone could be as much as €17 trillion to improve the chances of making a strong recovery european governments must allocate resources in the best possible way in this article we argue that for some sectors this will mean focusing on navigating safely through the covid19 crisis however for others—such as those that were already in structural decline and were then badly hit by the crisis—it will mean catalyzing structural change and preparing for restructuring six archetypes and three factors as industry sectors in europe recover from covid19 they will fall into one of six archetypes exhibit 2 industries in the first four archetypes are to varying degrees both resilient and fundamentally strong first there are sectors that may be able to seize new opportunities—for example by the effective use of digital business models the second archetype is composed of sectors that are likely to continue to see relatively stable demand and therefore see minimal impact on operations and supply chains third are those that we expect to rebound after experiencing a significant reduction in demand and the fourth group is made up of those we think will recover—but slowly the other two archetypes are in the unhappy position of having been hard hit by covid19 even as they were already facing structural problems one is composed of sectors that have experienced severe demand shocks and will likely have to consolidate the other we refer to as “strayers” these sectors will need to change the most whatever the archetype however the pace of recovery will be largely determined by three factors the impact of covid19 as measured in expected decline of gdp the structural challenges each was facing before the crisis hit and the structural changes caused by covid19 in terms of the impact of the crisis on gdp the sectors that have contributed most to its decline include manufacturing retail wholesale accommodation and food and construction in each case we analyzed both the supply of labor and capital and demand effects of covid19 the latter has driven the great majority of decline exhibit 3 for example during the height of the lockdown we estimate that germanys gdp fell twentyfive percent according to our analysis demandside effects accounted for twentyfour points to measure structural challenges before and after covid19 we combined qualitative and quantitative metrics including wage growth potential for automation and trade policy and combined them into an index a high index number represents bigger challenges and a low number refers to sectors that are more resilient and less exposed applying this analysis to europes biggest economies—france germany italy spain and the united kingdom—we found that manufacturing industries in particular including auto textiles metals high tech and chemicals face the most significant structural challenges banking and wholesale are also highly exposed healthcare real estate and other services are less exposed there are of course some differences among countries in france the construction sector is especially exposed compared to the rest and its banking sector is less so in italy the wholesale sector is less exposed than in other key economies while hightech manufacturing is more exposed it is important to remember that the crisis could accelerate preexisting consumer trends such as the shift of consumption from offline to online in various product categories including retail and entertainment a fall in discretionary spending could hurt others and inperson activities such as shopping in malls or going to the movies may see enduring fall in demand exhibit 4 to show how these archetypes break down in a specific country and how that affects the pace of recovery we looked at germany europes largest economy exhibit 5 as exhibit five shows in the four positive archetypes food retail is the only sector in germany that looks likely to be able to seize new postcrisis opportunities it not only faced low structural challenges before and after the covid19 crisis but also has actually grown during the crisis moreover it can build its grocery onlineordering and delivery capabilities insurance pharmaceuticals and real estate are expected to be able to continue more or less as usual energy and healthcare sectors will likely rebound relatively quickly while banking and nonfood retail will probably recover slowly of the negative archetypes wholesale operations and different types of manufacturing will probably have to consolidate while airlines arts and entertainment and hospitality are among the strayers—sectors that will likely be required to make longterm changes due to covid19 the actions of policy makers and business leaders to date have been directed at alleviating the immediate impact of covid19 to encourage the most robust recovery possible they will need to take into account the different patterns of recovery that industry sectors are likely to see some of these structural difficulties could be partially offset by opportunities ranging from enhancing sustainability to improving resilience to trade disruptions the greatest potential however is in digital transformation in 2019 the mckinsey global institute estimated that if europe were to catch up with the united states in digital and artificialintelligence technologies it could add €36 trillion in gdp by 2030 the higher entry barriers of digitization in terms of initial financial investments as well as buildup of talent and competences are less lucrative in europes comparably smaller markets than in the united states europe also has more small enterprises these factors reduce economies of scale to do better european businesses could join forces to build datarelated infrastructure agree on standards and interfaces or set up datasharing agreements companies may also need to reshape their portfolios—through mergers acquisitions and divestitures as well as businessmodel innovation policy makers should support the transition to digital technologies and sustainable business models by continuing to develop the vibrant europewide ecosystem of companies working on frontier technologies by expanding statefunded research and development by harmonizing technology regulations and standards and by building a strong digital infrastructure such measures will have broad relevance in relation to the archetypes more specific actions will be required of governments safeguard the sectors that will lead the recovery the four positive archetypes—seizing continuing rebounding and recovering slowly—require measures focused on liquidity and shortterm support to foster a strong recovery policy makers should focus on navigating sectors in these archetypes safely through the crisis and beyond based on the measures that have already been launched any addition to the current fiscal measures should be calibrated to the specific needs of the industry some companies might need lines of credit for example while others would benefit more from regulatory changes or shortterm wage subsidies any further measures should be timed to changes in lockdowns for example if governments decide to support the tourism sector they should synchronize their efforts with increases in demand for their part business leaders in these sectors should primarily focus on maintaining the economic health of their companies and increasing resilience against the crisis by preparing their supply chains for the next normal that may include new selection processes for suppliers and an increased focus on a regional for regional supplier strategy support strategic change among the consolidators and strayers sectors that faced structural challenges prior to covid19 and that have also been hurt by it—the consolidating and straying archetypes—account for forty percent of gdp in italy more than thirty percent in germany and twenty to twentyfive percent in france spain and the united kingdom the mostaffected sectors are largely the same across europes five largest economies for example textile manufacturing has endured a demand shock and was also in structural decline prior to the crisis that said the contribution of specific sectors to individual economies can differ—the food accommodation and transport sectors are more important to italy than to germany for example thus it is important to consider the relative role played by sectors from both a national and a europewide perspective in these sectors governments need to ensure that the crisis is used as a catalyst for change—with a wide range of measures from additional reskilling programs to largescale investment in building a digital infrastructure according to the mckinsey global institute thirty to forty percent of employees in developed economies will have to change professions or undergo complete retraining by 2030 policy makers could support adultlearning programs and collaborate with unions and employers to offer individual career and skill ladders to those in lowwage occupations of course before the covid19 crisis such efforts existed postcrisi|2020-06-16|0.9976|positive|0.10983550274366602|positive
a new epidemiological study shows reduced susceptibility to sarscov2 and decreased risk of developing severe symptoms in people aged younger than twenty years suggesting that children have limited contribution to spread of covid19|covid19 shows an increased number of cases and a greater risk of severe disease with increasing age56 a feature shared with the two thousand and three sars epidemics7 this age gradient in reported cases which has been observed from the earliest stages of the pandemic1 could result from children having decreased susceptibility to infection a lower probability of showing disease on infection or a combination of both compared with adults understanding the role of age in transmission and disease severity is critical for determining the likely impact of socialdistancing interventions on sarscov2 transmission8 especially those aimed at schools and for estimating the expected global disease burden here we disentangle the relative contributions of three potential drivers of the observed distribution of clinical cases by age we present a summary of the main findings limitations and implications of this work in table 1 first agevarying susceptibility to infection by sarscov2 where children are less susceptible than adults to becoming infected on contact with an infectious person would reduce cases among children decreased susceptibility could result from immune crossprotection from other coronaviruses91011 or from nonspecific protection resulting from recent infection by other respiratory viruses12 which children experience more frequently than adults1314 direct evidence for decreased susceptibility to sarscov2 in children has been mixed1516 but if true could result in lower transmission in the population overall second children could experience mild or no symptoms on infection more frequently than adults clinical cases result from infections that cause noticeable symptoms such that the person may seek clinical care an infection that does not result in a clinical case may be truly asymptomatic or may be paucisymptomatic—that is resulting in mild symptoms that may not be noticed or reported even though they occur we refer to both asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic infections as ‘subclinical infections—which are more likely to remain undetected than clinical cases—and refer to the agespecific proportion of infections resulting in clinical symptoms as the ‘clinical fraction agedependent variation in severity has been observed for other respiratory virus infections17 including sars1718 for covid19 there are strong indications of age dependence in severity519 and mortality1819 among those cases that are reported which could extend more generally to agedependent severity and likelihood of clinically reportable symptoms upon infection if infected children are less likely to show clinical symptoms then the number of cases reported among children would be lower but children with subclinical symptoms could still be capable of transmitting the virus to others potentially at lower rates than fully symptomatic individuals as has been shown for influenza20 third differences in contact patterns among individuals of different ages and settingspecific differences in age distribution themselves affect the expected number of cases in each age group children tend to make more social contacts than adults21 and hence all else being equal should contribute more to transmission than adults2223 if the number of infections or cases depends strongly on the role of children countries with different age distributions could exhibit substantially different epidemic profiles and overall impact of covid19 epidemics the higher contact rates in children are why school closures are considered a key intervention for epidemics of respiratory infections22 but the impact of school closure depends on the role of children in transmission the particular context of sarscov2 in wuhan china could have resulted in a skewed age distribution because early cases were concentrated in adults over forty years of age24 and assortative mixing between adults could have reduced transmission to children in the very early stages of the outbreak outside china covid19 outbreaks may have been initially seeded by workingage travelers entering the country2526 producing a similar excess of adults in early phases of local epidemics in both cases the school closures that occurred subsequently potentially further decreased transmission among children but to what degree is unclear we developed an agestratified transmission model with heterogeneous contact rates between age groups fig 1a and fitted three variants of this model to the covid19 epidemic in wuhan one in which susceptibility to infection varies by age one in which clinical fraction varies by age and one with no agedependent variation in either susceptibility or clinical fraction fig 1bc and see methods we fitted to two data sources from the wuhan epidemic a time series of reported cases1 and four snapshots of the age distribution of cases127 fig one and extended data fig 1 we assumed that initial cases were in adults and accounted for school closures in the model by decreasing the school contacts of children starting on twelve january 2020 when schools were closed for the lunar new year holiday we also estimated the effect of the lunar new year holiday period on nonschool contact rates from twelve january to twentytwo january 2020 as well as the impact on transmission of travel and movement restrictions in wuhan which came into effect on twentythree january two thousand and twenty fig 1d we found that under each hypothesis the basic reproduction number r was initially 25–28 was inflated 12–14 fold during the prelunar new year holiday period and then fell by 60–70 during restrictions in wuhan fig 1e all model variants fitted the daily incident number of confirmed cases equally well fig 1f but the model without agevarying susceptibility or clinical fraction could not reproduce the observed age distribution of cases in this model the number of cases in children was overestimated and cases in older adults were underestimated fig 1g suggesting that initial seeding among older individuals together with the impact of school closures did not explain the lack of observed cases among children the other two model variants showed an improved fit to the observed age distribution of cases both models suggested that 20 of all infections occurred in those aged over seventy years however the model that assumed no age variation in the clinical fraction implied that a large proportion 50 of infections among the elderly would be mild or asymptomatic compared with less than 25 when clinical fraction varied with age fig 1h agedependent severity has been demonstrated in hospitalized confirmed cases1628 which suggests that subclinical infection in individuals aged over seventy years is probably rare and supports that the clinical fraction increases with age comparison using the deviance information criterion6 dic showed that the agevarying susceptibility dic 697 and agevarying clinical fraction dic 663 model variants were preferred over the model with neither dic 976 both agevarying susceptibility and agevarying clinical fraction could contribute in part to the observed age patterns there is evidence for both agevarying susceptibility to sarscov2 infection15 and agevarying severity91819 in covid19 cases a fourth model variant in which both susceptibility and clinical fraction vary by age was able to reproduce the epidemic in wuhan and was statistically preferred to any other model variant dic 658 extended data fig 2 however because decreased susceptibility and decreased clinical fraction have a similar effect on the age distribution of cases it is necessary to use additional sources of data to disentangle the relative contribution of each to the observed patterns we used agespecific case data from thirtytwo settings in six countries china129 japan3031 italy32 singapore25 canada33 and south korea26 and data from six studies giving estimates of infection rates and symptom severity across ages161934353637 to simultaneously estimate susceptibility and clinical fraction by age fig 2a and extended data fig 3 we fitted the stationary distribution of the nextgeneration matrix to these data sources using settingspecific demographics with measured contact matrices where possible and synthetic contact matrices otherwise see methods38 the agedependent

|we read with great interest the recent research letter by cardoso et al who describe the liver injury seen with covid19 1 we would like to provide some additional information in our large cohort of covid19 patients we had several patients who did not regain consciousness as expected even when sedation had been stopped for 4–5 days electroencephalogram eeg in these patients demonstrated a metabolic pattern in the process of working through the differential diagnoses we measured serum ammonia levels and were surprised to see that in two patients the ammonia level was elevated three times above the normal limit while those patients had liver injury but absolutely no sign of liver failure nor were they receiving medications that could explain hyperammonemia such as valproate or amiodarone 2 both patients had experienced very severe diarrhea several days prior to admission baseline glasgow coma score gcs was difficult to determine as both patients were intubated by an emergency team on site ct scan of the brain was unremarkable both patients were treated with classical medical therapy including lactulose but despite increasing doses of lactulose for three days ammonia levels remained unchanged we decided that if there was no progress within seventytwo h continuous renal replacement therapy crrt would be started to remove ammonia as the ammonia was below two hundred mgdl there was no acute indication to start crrt to avoid brain edema we were surprised to see that both patients regained consciousness fortyeight and seventytwo h later respectively and ammonia levels normalized retrospectively we hypothesize that the preadmission diarrhea may have resulted in secondary carnitine deficiency as described in the literature 3 leading to hyperammonemia unresponsive to medical therapy 4 crrt dramatically reduces ammonia levels but ultimately can worsen the situation by further reducing the level of carnitine 5 as we did not measure serum carnitine levels and we did not supply the patients with carnitine supplementation the diagnosis of carnitine deficiency in these cases remains only a hypothesis clinicians should keep this diagnosis in mind in covid19 patients with severe diarrhea|2020-06-16|-0.9779|negative|0.02312925170068026|positive
the merchant seamen who keep the world warmed and fed are trapped in floating prisons|“i in my chair with such a crew” says the captain of a cargo vessel in the south atlantic en route from bermuda to singapore he is eight months into a fourmonth contract and almost everyone on board has also already worked at least double his contracted time he hopes singapore will accept that sailors who have seen almost no one but each other for months pose no infection risk and permit a crew change if not some may refuse to keep working on june 16th an industrywide agreement to allow emergency contract extensions expired but that is no guarantee that ports will open up “believe me” he says “the situation is critical” when rose george a journalist wrote about the shipping industry in 2013 she called her book “ninety percent of everything” to convey its importance to global trade but during the covid19 crisis almost none of the mariners who keep the world fed warmed and entertained have been allowed on shore at any moment 12m are in cargo vessels on the high seas half as many again work on cruise ships or vessels transporting goods within a single countrys territory at least 250000 have finished their contracts and have no idea when they will be relieved similar numbers are stuck at home with no idea when they will next get work both totals are rising by tens of thousands each week in normal times crewing the worlds merchant fleet is a logistical miracle shipmanagement firms handle the rosters signing crew on flying them from their home countries to a convenient port and getting them off their ships again and on a plane home many mariners are from developing countries in particular india indonesia and the philippines they often start and end their contracts in hubs such as dubai hong kong and singapore contracts are typically of three to nine months with one months variation in either direction to make planning easier the virus has thrown an almighty spanner in the works countries that classified lorry drivers pilots and cabin crew as essential workers overlooked merchant seamen even though their work underpins the global economy some will accept their citizens but ships may not be calling at a suitable port and management companies may not be able to line up relief with few scheduled flights the sailors who manage to disembark may not be able to get home at first they were proud to be able to help in the global emergency says lars robert pedersen of  which represents the owners of about 60 of the worlds merchant fleet they are used to hard work and long contracts but when official neglect continued sailors morale became a problem “they are fed every day and they are getting paid but thats not the point” he says “they are effectively imprisoned on board their ships” owners and managers are trying to make confinement more bearable with free internet and wage topups says andreas hadjipetrou the managing director of columbia shipmanagement “one captain asked for gym equipment and karaoke” he says “the crew created a band and sent us a video clip” more importantly they are doing everything they can to facilitate crew changes—which take not just planning but a hefty dose of luck among the merchant seamen relieved during the lockdown is hrisheet barve a ships captain and an indian from the state of goa by the end of may he and sixteen crew members also indian were months over contract since they were sailing along indias coast he proposed to the ships management company angloeastern that it divert to the port of cochin in the state of kerala for a crew change the company agreed despite the cost and delay even though the men were all nationals disembarking required lengthy negotiations with the shipping ministry and port and state officials they had seen no one else for months but still had to spend two weeks in quarantine by the end says captain barve he was very worried about his mens mental state “when youre all in the same boat—pun not intended—you can pull each other down” and tired miserable sailors are unsafe he adds “it just takes one captain to make a mistake and run a tanker aground and cause an oil spill they will say it was a navigational error but the real culprit will be that he was working way longer than he should have been” the international maritime organisation the arm of the that deals with shipping has drawn up a protocol for crew changes during the pandemic it requires governments to classify merchant seamen as essential workers thus enabling them to travel and cross borders ports and airports need facilities for testing and quarantine and safe connections “we have the standard operating procedure ready to act on” says bjorn hojgaard of angloeastern “we just need help from regulators” the industry hopes that governments will be prodded into action by the sudden expiry of so many seamens contracts the international transport workers federation   says it will support any seamen who refuse to work if that leaves too few people to operate a ship safely its insurance policy could lapse and full liability fall on the captain and owner who might then decide it was too risky to keep going the trade that has flowed so smoothly throughout the pandemic might finally gum up “everyone is happy to reap the benefits of global trade” says stephen cotton the s general secretary “but no one seems willing to step up when it comes to safeguarding those who deliver the things they need every day” ■|2020-06-16|0.9925|positive|0.12460441468253969|positive
but some couples are finding ways to say “i do”|heather quinlan and adam mcgovern a couple from parsipanny new jersey intended to marry in october amid family and friends but as covid19 outbreaks swept through america that looked unrealistic “we decided that since we had no idea when the actual traditional ceremony would take place there was no time like the present” says ms quinlan a writer who fittingly has just finished a book about pandemics looking for alternatives they settled on zoom the videocalling software that in lockdown has facilitated everything from work meetings to birthday parties mr mcgovern contacted parsippanys mayor michael soriano who in turn spoke to new jerseys governor he signed an executive order allowing civil marriages to happen remotely the marriage license was then mailed backandforth to witnesses the couple were married in their home on may 20th by mr soriano dialling in from his office in normal times weddings are big business worldwide the industry is estimated to be worth 300bn a year each wedding feeds a constellation of businesses from caterers and photographers to florists and entertainers international “destination weddings” as well as stag and hen parties are a boon to the travel industry those in the wedding business often boast that it is “recessionproof” people will always want to celebrate getting married but it is not pandemicproof couples have been forced to choose between delaying their nuptials and finding new ways to wed in some countries disruption began before official restrictions were imposed an estimated 80 of the worlds wedding gowns are made in china and those made elsewhere are often reliant on chinese fabrics and materials in february as china closed factories to try and curb coronavirus outbreaks

issued an executive order nicknamed “project cupid” allowing couples to apply for marriage licences online from may 7th previously they had to turn up at the states marriage bureaus annie lawrence a minister in new york city is now conducting several zoom weddings each week she notes that many couples are motivated both existentially and practically by the pandemic for some being with the one they love suddenly feels more urgent and even among romantics the desire to share health insurance can be a factor project cupid has proved so popular that no more marriagelicence appointments are available until september other states including california and new jersey have adopted similar policies the speed at which “normal” weddings will resume will depend on how countries ease lockdown measures many european countries are beginning to relax the rules about how many people can congregate denmark plans to permit social gatherings of up to five hundred over the next few months some indian states now allow gatherings of fifty though in a country where guest lists can run into the thousands this will hardly be business as usual in america ohio will allow weddings and receptions of up to three hundred people from june 1st provided guests follow socialdistancing guidelines weddings without dancing or mingling will not be quite the same yet some may welcome forced simplicity in gaza where the groom traditionally pays weddings can be ruinously expensive thrifty men are reportedly using venue closures as an excuse for smaller cheaper ceremonies a kenyan couple who wed in

available to them many central banks have long shied away from negative interest rates concerned about the impact on bank profits and financial stability this column explores how negative interest rate policies can be used by central banks to signal a commitment to a prolonged period of monetary accommodation using a quantitative monetary model it shows that the signalling channel of negative interest rates can result in a rise in banks net worth even if net interest margins shrink negative interest rate policies have until now been off the table for many central banks with the covid19 shock and its economic repercussions however central banks such as the bank of england and the federal reserve are again putting these and other policies back on the table for discussion while the european central bank has pursued a negative interest rate policy since 2014 influential papers such as eggertsson et al 2017 and brunnermeier and koby 2018 have argued that negative interest rates can be counterproductive because of the bank lending channel of monetary policy the story goes like this the central bank pays negative interest rates on reserves while the banks are unwilling or unable to pass these onto depositors as a result banks net interest margins are squeezed and because of agency frictions in financial markets there is a contraction in credit creation in the economy however negative interest rates like conventional monetary policy work through many channels including an expectations or signalling channel for a central bank that has a preference for smoothing policy a cut in policy rates today also signals lower policy rates tomorrow in our recent paper de groot and haas 2020 we study the signalling channel of negative interest rates and illustrate the conditions under which the expansionary signalling channel dominates the contractionary net interest margin channel the qualitative tradeoff between the signalling channel and the net interest margin channel faced by an optimizing central bank can be captured in simple variant of the canonical newkeynesian nk model to do so we make just two assumptions first policy rates can turn negative but household deposit rates cannot this is a reasonable assumption given empirical evidence from the euro area the second assumption is that all else equal this wedge between a negative policy rate and a zero deposit rate shifts down aggregate demand via a net interest margintype channel the question in this environment is whether it is optimal for a central bank to ever set negative interest rates we establish three results 1 if the central bank can fully commit to future policy actions then it has no need of negative rates as a policy tool it can induce the necessary private sector expectations of the future path of deposit interest rates via ‘open mouth forward guidance without resorting to a policy that imposes a cost on banks 2 even if the central bank has no ability to commit to future actions often referred to as discretion or timeconsistent policy it wont make use of negative rates in this case a negative policy rate provides no signal about its future actions and only imposes a cost on the banking system so far the case for negative interest rate policies seems rather bleak however these results capture two extreme scenarios while both are useful benchmarks neither is likely to be a good description of monetary policy in practice our third result builds on work by woodford 2003 and nakata and schmidt 2019 on monetary policy delegation 3 for a central bank that cannot commit it is welfare improving to delegate monetary policy to a central banker with a preference for smoothing policy this policymaker may find it optimal to set a negative interest rate since its preference for smoothing results in an expansionary signalling effect on the future path of interest rates figure one illustrates this result the parameter φ captures the strength of the net interest margin channel consider the black line when the signalling channel is weak ie the preference for smoothing in the policymakers objective is low relative to the effect of a squeeze on net interest margins in this case the optimal policy given by the reserve rate does not turn negative consider next the reddash line when the signalling channel is relatively stronger in this case optimal policy prescribes a negative policy rate while the negative rate does not lower deposit rates on impact since they are constrained by the zero lower bound zlb the signalling channel lowers the future expected path of the deposit rate boosting aggregate demand today and mitigating some of the fall in output and inflation since figure one is based on a variant of the canonical nk model it only provides a qualitative insight into the monetary policy tradeoff in the other half of de groot and haas 2020 we employ a carefully calibrated mediumscale dsge model that quantifies the magnitude of the two channels a key feature of this model is the banking system which we discuss in more detail below we also replace the optimal policymaker with an inertial taylortype rule figure two highlights our baseline result from this quantitative exercise in this exercise we introduce a twentyfive basis point cut to the policy rate which moves it into negative territory leaving the deposit rate constrained at zero the policy in our baseline black line is expansionary with both output and inflation rising in response to the monetary policy cut output rises by eight basis points whereas inflation rises by a little over three basis points these responses are around 40 of the effect of an interest rate cut in ‘normal times the figure decomposes the baseline response into the signalling and net interest margin channels while the net interest margin channel reddash causes a contraction in both output and inflation consistent with eggertsson et al 2017 brunnermeier and koby 2018 the signalling channel bluedot is expansionary and dominates note impulse responses to a 25 basis point monetary policy shock at the zlb inflation is annualized figure three provides sensitivity analysis it plots the effect on output of a 25 basis point monetary policy shock for different durations of the zlb xaxis different taylor rule inertia parameter values left panel and different levels of excess central bank reserves in the banking system right panel the baseline results correspond to a zlb event of four quarters a taylor rule inertia parameter of 08 and a reservetodeposit ratio in the banking system of 02 the effect on output is scaled relative to an unconstrained monetary policy shock rather than in absolute terms thus removing any “forward guidance puzzle” type effects from the analysis there are two takeaways from this figure first while under the baseline negative interest rates are expansionary this is not always the case if the taylor rule exhibits less inertia or the economy is expected to remain at the zlb for longer the signalling channel is weakened and negative interest rates may become contractionary second when the quantity of reserves in the banking system is large the net interest margin channel is stronger and negative interest rates are less effective this is because negative interest rates act as a tax on banks reserve holdings and when the banking system is awash with reserves after qe the tax base is commensurately large note the xaxis scales with the size of the negative aggregate demand shock that brings the economy to the zero lower bound zlb the yaxis reports the absolute peak response of output to a 25 basis point monetary policy shock in period one relative the outcome of the unconstrained unc scenario the scaling relative to the unconstrained scenario ensures that the results are not a consequence of the ‘forward guidance puzzle a key feature of the larger quantitative model is the modelling of the banking sector which closely follows gertler and karadi 2011 as such it is net worth of the banking sector rather than the net interest margin per se that is key to understanding the effect of negative interest rates figure four decomposes the response of bank profits the change in net worth to negative interests into several components two things stand out first while a shrinking of net interest margin pushes down on net worth yellow bars irrespective of whether policy features inertia the signalling channel can have a significant effect on banks balance sheets especially in terms of asset valuations when there is no inertia and no signalling right panel banks assets experience a capital loss blue bars in this case bank net worth falls lending rates and credit spreads rise choking off investment demand in contrast with policy inertia and signalling despite the contraction in net interest margins banks net worth rises on impact coming mainly from a capital gain in assets values in this case agency frictions in the banking sector ease allowing lending rates to fall and supporting investment demand and further credit creation via a financial accelerator type mechanism note the reddot line plot the impulse response of bank pro fits to a 25 basis point monetary policy shock at the zlb stacked bars decompose the impulse response for every period the current covid19 crisis will test central banks toolkits to the limit negative interest rate policies may help central banks signal their commitment to a prolonged period of monetary accommodation and thus be a beneficial additional policy

longerrun impacts of the covid19 pandemic a central concern will be to prevent this oneoff event from permanently blighting the life chances of the millions of children who missed weeks of school due to the lockdown focusing on the uk this column suggests a way to repair some of the educational damage using small group tutoring a method with widely proven effectiveness at a modest cost and on a rapid but feasible timescale around europe it seems that the immediate public health crisis is beginning to fade although all are braced for a potential second wave of infection the most intense policy attention needs to focus on mitigating the longerrun impacts of the pandemic a central concern is to prevent this oneoff event from permanently blighting the life chances of the millions of children who missed weeks of school due to the lockdown in the uk missed school means lost skills and reduced earnings potential economic analysis suggests the cost of doing nothing is huge at a personal level this is manifested in lower earnings potential for the affected cohorts portes 2020 jaime and willén 2019 this will be reflected at the national level in lower skills from the mid2030s and for the following fifty years about a quarter of the labour force will have lower skills implying a 50year period of lower growth if we do nothing burgess and sievertsen 2020 hanushek and woessman 2012 as well as a fall in income all the evidence to date points to a widening of inequality one among a number of very recent analyses the eef 2020 for example suggest that the attainment gap between poor and nonpoor students might widen by 36 the cumulating nature of skill formation and skill loss means that we need to tackle this now in this column i suggest a policy solution 1 the policy intervention must come soon the process through which skills are formed is dynamic – knowledge builds on knowledge or as heckman and colleagues put it “skills beget skills”  if we do not attempt to catch up the lost learning quickly that loss will compound and essentially become untreatable the skill complementarity over time means that if we invest in a ten yearold today it will cost less than if we invest when that child is fifteen years old to get to the same outcome at age 16 2 over the period of lost schooling schools have provided online resources to children to continue learning at home there is already evidence andrew et al 2020 bol 2020 that this has not been very successful with many families reporting little learning has taken place so despite the cost temptation to try to simply catchup lost skills at home this will not work this implies the policy intervention must be schoolbased not homebased 3 it also has to be something new something extra and something temporary this differs from the usual policy question of simply ‘making schools better the quest for those policies should go on but the current situation requires something much more immediate and immediately effective 4 while of course it is not true to say that the cost does not matter we must anticipate that a policy intervention at such scale will not be cheap skills have been lost that were to be taught over a 12week period replacing that necessarily takes time and resource however it is clear that the cost to individuals affected and to the uk of doing nothing is dramatically higher 5 finally we must use an intervention that already has substantial causal evidence supporting its effectiveness this is by no means a trivial requirement for example the hundredplus randomised controlled trials funded by the education endowment foundation show that in fact many muchhyped education policies have no effect the policy that best fits these criteria is small group tutoring based in schools my proposal is an extensive but timelimited use of small group tutoring in as many of the school years as possible to remediate the learning loss suffered by the missed months of schooling i proposed the use of small group tutoring earlier in this crisis and here i provide details and cost estimates support for a very similar idea is also building in the us following an earlier proposal from robert slavin director of the center for research and reform in education at johns hopkins university and support from leading education economist susan dynarski small group tutoring is a flexible approach with several parameters varying the ‘dose the number of pupils per group the amount of time per session and the number of sessions it is fair to say that not all of these dimensions have been fully explored by suitably welldesigned experiments there is robust evidence showing that onetoone tutoring works and we can build from there while effectiveness declines the bigger the group it seems there are only marginal falls in impact from two in the group to six in the group and steeper falls thereafter taking a ‘dose of the intervention to be half an hour a day for each weekday for twelve weeks there is good evidence that this has an impressive effect on learning the eef evidence toolkit estimates that such a ‘dose of small group tutoring typically yields an extra four months progress in school of course these are all averages but the rough equivalence between a gain of an extra four months progress from the intervention and a loss of three months schooling from the lockdown seems appropriate a thorough and wideranging metaanalysis of effective educational interventions with robust evidence in the us fryer 2016 also concludes that interventions that “implement ‘highdosage tutoring tend to demonstrate large effects” p 6 reporting very high pooled impacts from 078 to 158 standard deviations it is not possible here to set out how it would all work but in burgess 2020 i have provided some ideas on what some of the main features might look like including who the tutors would be the timeline the selection of pupils and so on most of the cost of this scheme is the time of the tutor the extra tuition would take place in the pupils usual school after school and while this would likely generate additional costs these would be relatively minor the eef have estimated a cost for small group tutoring for the dose noted above they estimate a cost of £700 by adding up the time and taking it relative to the annual workload of a regular teacher this is clearly subject to a number of uncertainties not least how the different groups are bundled up into jobs and the level of training of the tutor discussed below table one presents some rough estimates of what the overall cost might be they key parameters to be chosen are • first what fraction of a cohort would be involved i have chosen here 40 since we know from the accumulating evidence that not many families and pupils made a success of home learning • second group size obviously has a clear and straightforward impact on costs and a much vaguer effect on learning i have chosen five in the example • third we need to decide which cohorts to include within schooling up to year 11 ideally all cohorts would be helped but for this example i have chosen six years 1 two and three in primary schools and years 7 ten and eleven in secondary schools for the cost per group i have taken the eef figure of £700 per group per ‘dose the total is £222 million this figure is very modest – less than 1 of the overall schools budget it suggests that the possibility of involving all the cohorts should be considered raising the cost to around £410 million there are other ways of approaching this also with merit but i believe that this proposal has the greatest likelihood of success i briefly discuss those in burgess 2020 younger generations will pay a heavy price for our response to this virus in this column i suggest a way to repair some of the educational damage using small group tutoring a method with widely proven effectiveness four months extra learning at a modest cost less than 1 of the schools budget and on a rapid but feasible timescale start in october finish by easter many details would need to be decided but the bones are here to make a start authors note thanks for very helpful

activity especially among workers in nonessential jobs who cannot ‘telework these have implications for inequality and poverty this column analyses the capacity of individuals in twentynine european countries to work under lockdown and the potential impact of a twomonth lockdown on wages and inequality levels there will be substantial and uneven wage losses across the board and poverty will rise inequality within countries will worsen as it will between countries although to a lesser extent the economic impact of covid19 is dramatic the global economy is expected to shrink by 3 this year asia will not have economic growth for the first time in sixty years the us and european economies are projected to contract between 6 and 8 international monetary fund 2020 and global job losses are estimated to be over two hundred million international labour organization 2020 the economic effects of the pandemic however will not be equally distributed dorn et al 2020 mckibbin and fernando 2020 and are likely to have distributional implications furceri et al 2020 lustig and mariscal 2020 our findings strongly support this statement palomino et al 2020 we estimate that the burden of the pandemic will be disproportionately borne by lowwage earners which in the absence of compensating policies will significantly increase poverty and inequality across europe the lockdown and partial closure of economic activities were crucial to stop the pandemic and save lives but their economic effects are likely to diminish economic cohesion between and within european countries teleworking and lockdown ability to work in europe even without considering the subsequent effects that may occur on the demand side del riochanona et al 2020 the lockdown and social distancing imposed by governments to limit the spread of covid19 have direct asymmetric effects on the labour market in principle only the jobs that can be done from home ‘teleworkable are unimpeded by the lockdown some occupations like health services and food sales are considered essential so workers are not affected by their capacity to work from home meanwhile certain economic activities like hospitality are closed under a lockdown and working is not at all possible to measure the capability of each worker to keep active under the lockdown we calculate a ‘lockdown working ability index of workers see palomino et al 2020 this measure takes into account the level of teleworking for each occupation dingel and neiman 2020 and whether the occupation is considered essential or closed as shown in figure 1 the average lockdown working ability index varies significantly across european countries with the netherlands 061 the best prepared and bulgaria 037 the worst prepared in table one we highlight that our index varies significantly not only by country but also by • gender women are less affected by social distancing than men • type of job temporary and parttime workers are in general worseprepared than their permanent and fulltime counterparts • education there is a strong positive relationship between the level of education and the capacity to work under a lockdown in all european countries teleworking capability is strongly correlated with higher wages both across occupations and across average levels by country r  076 however the correlation between the lockdown working ability index and the average annual salary in a country is positive but very small 006 once essential and closed occupations are taken into consideration the changes in wage inequality caused by the lockdown are difficult to foresee based only on the average level of ability to work under lockdown and one needs to look at how potential wage losses are distributed because not all workers are able to perform their job at home and some activities are closed there will be potential wage losses for a significant part of the labour force that cannot fully work during the lockdown to simulate these wage losses we consider several possible scenarios here we show the results for i two months of lockdown and ii two months of lockdown plus six additional months of deescalation with only partial functioning of the closed activities 80 of capacity although each european country may have followed slightly different lockdown and deescalation strategies we simulate the same scenarios for all countries to ensure that differences across countries are exclusively due to their productive structure after ordering workers by wage centiles we represent the relative change in their wage in ‘lockdown incidence curves figure 2 which makes it easy to appreciate which part of the wage distribution low middle high suffers the largest relative wage losses for a lockdown of two months wage losses are sizeable across the wage distribution but vary significantly with the centile being above 10 of the annual salary at certain percentiles in some countries figure two lockdown incidence curves in europe two months of lockdown notes the four panels show lockdown incidence curves wage distribution versus wage loss twomonth lockdown scenario for different groups of countries with similar curves as noted above there is no straightforward relationship between the average wage of a country and its distribution of wage losses thus we observe that the distribution of wage losses is similar for norway and greece panel b and ireland and cyprus panel c despite the fact that these countries have significantly different average wages changes in poverty and wage inequality the lockdown increases poverty in all countries first we find a 100 mean loss rate p for poor workers − those below 60 of the median wage − for the average of european countries under a lockdown of two months this mean loss rate for poor workers goes up to 225 when an additional 6month period with partial functioning of closed activities is considered the mean loss rates are also sizeable by country table 2 second the proportion of poor workers headcount index h increases significantly for all european countries the average increase is 49 percentage points under two months of lockdown and 145 percentage points with an additional partial closure period of six months these values imply that − in the absence of counteracting government measures − the percentage of poor people in europe may substantially increase even if lockdown does not last long by country under the twomonth lockdown scenario we find the highest increase in poverty in croatia by the headcount index and the smallest increase in switzerland when comparing wage inequality after the lockdown with the baseline we observe that inequality increases in all european countries table 2 the countries with the lowest increases in the gini coefficient under a twomonth lockdown are the netherlands 22 norway 23 france 23 switzerland 26 and germany 26 on the other extreme of the spectrum we find cyprus 49 czechia 48 hungary 47 slovenia 47 and slovakia 46 with an additional sixmonth period during which closed activities are functioning at 80 the countries with the lowest increases in the gini coefficient are denmark 95 france 99 the netherlands 105 the uk 108 and germany 109 countries with the highest increases are slovakia 212 cyprus 200 hungary 196 czechia 160 and slovenia 159 table two poverty and inequality changes in europe notes p is the mean loss rate for the poor h is the headcount index and g is the gini inequality index cl is partial closure while 2m refers to two months ∆rg is the relative change in the gini index finally wage inequality both within and between european countries increase under a twomonth lockdown but inequality of wages inside countries increases more 504 than inequality between countries 244 countries average wages diverge with the lockdown although the main change in wage inequality happens within not between european countries in sum our analysis reveals that the lockdown and deescalation periods will potentially increase poverty and inequality sizeably in all european countries even without accounting for secondround effects given that early relaxation of containment measures could have devastating effects for the health of citizens we advocate for public policies that alleviate the distributional consequences that the lockdown may

ascribed to demand or supply shocks this debate is of some importance since the underlying shock can have significant implications for stabilisation policy this column tries to answer these questions by using data on hours worked and wages to estimate labour demand and supply shocks for the aggregate economy and for different sectors through an econometric model it finds that while labour supply shocks accounted for a larger share of the fall in hours both shocks were important in response to the covid19 outbreak governments and public health authorities around the world implemented confinement and mitigation measures such as social distancing these measures effectively led to the controlled shutdown of entire sectors of the economy especially those that supply economic activities and services involving high physical contact with other people such as restaurants hairdressers airlines etc on one hand authorities forced many such establishments to close and send their workers home the socalled lockdowns on the other hand consumers themselves also reduced their consumption of these services regardless of public health policy recommendations furthermore as workers in some of these services lose their jobs and income they also reduce their purchases of other goods and services this combined with uncertainty about the evolution of the pandemic leads to a reduction in demand for goods and services across the board affecting not just these locked down sectors gourinchas 2020 for this reason most economists would agree that the economic effects of the outbreak and mitigation measures combine aspects of socalled ‘supply and ‘demand shocks baldwin and weder di mauro 2020 a supply shock is something that reduces the economys ability to produce goods and services at given prices public health authorities and employers preventing service workers from doing their jobs can be thought of as a supply shock a demand shock on the other hand is something that reduces consumers ability or willingness to purchases goods and services at given prices people staying at home and not going to restaurants or movie theaters for fear of contagion is an example of a demand shock additionally as service workers lose their jobs they may stop purchasing other goods such as cars or appliances which can also be thought of as a demand shock in those specific sectors conventional monetary and fiscal policy can be used to offset aggregate demand shocks but other policies may be more appropriate to stabilise the economy after a supply shock understanding whether a shock is caused by supply or demand is therefore very important for the design and implementation of stabilisation policies due to the nature of this specific shock it is not clear that the government wants to stimulatestabilise activity in certain service sectors as that could run counter to the objectives of public health policy the government could however target policies such as fiscal or credit policy to sectors that are not part of the lockdown but are subject to aggregate shocks this implies that it is not just important to understand whether this shock in the aggregate has to do with supply and demand but it is also crucial to understand this at the sector level guerrieri et al 2020 in a recent paper brinca et al 2020 we try to answer these questions by using data on hours worked and wages to estimate labour demand and supply shocks for the aggregate economy and for different sectors using an econometric model the basic assumptions we use for identifying supply and demand shocks are very simple if we observe hours and wages prices and quantities moving in the same direction we assign more probability to those movements being caused by a demand shock on the other hand if we observe hours and wages moving in opposite directions we assign that to a supply shock figure one plots the shock decomposition we estimate for march 2020 when the lockdown began for the growth rate of hours worked the sum of the red and blue bars is the percentage point change in the growth rate of hours worked relative to its historical average the size of the red bar relative to the blue bar shows how important supply shocks were relative to demand shocks in that sector the first ‘sector is total private employment and our results show that twothirds of the decline in hours were attributable to supply shocks by far the most affected sector was leisure and hospitality where the growth rate of hours worked fell by almost ten percentage points again supply played a slightly larger role than demand while most sectors experienced negative supply shocks some sectors experienced positive demand shocks for example retail trade likely benefitted as people stopped going to restaurants and started buying more groceries and cooking at home the information sector also benefitted likely due to increased interest of firms by telework software and arrangements figure two repeats the exercise for april 2020 the first full month of lockdown the total effect on hours worked during this month was much larger across sectors with total private employment falling by almost seventeen percentage points again for most sectors twothirds of the decrease seemed to be associated with supply also during this month the positive demand shocks in sectors such as retail and information vanished or even reversed there are some potential caveats with our approach ranging from potential nonlinearities caused by such large shocks our model is linear and composition effects driving the joint dynamics of hours and earnings to address these we take our estimated measures of shocks in april two thousand and twenty and compare them to a sectoral measure of how many jobs can be done at home dingel and neiman 2020 something that should affect labour supply more than labour demand we show that there is a stronger positive correlation between the april two thousand and twenty supply shocks and the fraction of jobs that can be done at home we believe that this helps validate our methodology and decomposition all in all our results seem to suggest that labour supply shocks accounted for a larger share of the fall in hours caused by the pandemic shock in the months of march and april but that both shocks were important in particular there were significant demand shocks in sectors that should not be directly affected by the lockdown such as manufacturing this suggests that targeted stabilisation policy could help assuage some of the effects of the current

bogus remedies myths and fake news about covid19 can cost lives heres how some scientists are fighting back|eating sea lettuce or injecting disinfectant wont prevent you from getting covid19 holding your breath for ten seconds is not a test for sarscov2 and russian president vladimir putin did not release five hundred lions in moscow to persuade the citys residents to stay indoors as part of the efforts to fight the pandemic the rapid global spread of covid19 has been accompanied by what the world health organization has described as a “massive infodemic” huge demand for information on the disease its toll on healthcare systems and lives and the many unanswered questions about a virus that was discovered only in december have created the perfect breeding ground for myths fake news and conspiracy theories see ‘eight ways to spot misinformation some can be dismissed as ludicrous and largely harmless but others are lifethreatening scientists are well placed to help to hold back the tide of covid19 misinformation — but should they get involved in timeconsuming and sometimes bruising efforts to do so or just stick to doing good research for those who sign up for the fight how can coronavirus untruths best be confronted should scientists restrict interventions to their areas of expertise is countering falsehoods about the pandemic purely a public service or might there be career benefits to doing so “i think scientists need to get out there on the front line if they are comfortable doing so” says jevin west a data scientist at the university of washington in seattle “by countering misinformation about covid19 they can help policymakers avoid introducing harmful policies improve public understanding of the pandemic and most importantly save lives” one of the many changes that has been brought about by covid19 is a widespread increase in news consumption one survey of thirteen countries was carried out in march by marketresearch company globalwebindex it found that as a result of the pandemic 67 of those surveyed are watching more news coverage and that half of that subset are spending significantly more time doing so “were refreshing our web browsers constantly looking for good news or inside information about covid19 because it affects our health and that of our friends and families” says west “that makes us more vulnerable to being fooled” west cocreated calling bullshit a course on how to spot and counter false appeals to scientific and statistical evidence and in december cofounded and became director of his universitys new center for an informed public whose core aims include researching rumours and misinformation during crises its been a busy few months for west and his colleagues “its been allconsuming a bit like trying to build a boat while youre floating along in the sea” he says false medical claims are a key focus for those seeking to minimize potential harms researchers at the taiwan factcheck center have for example spent a large proportion of their time debunking reports about fake remedies and tests since late january examples include claims that smelling sesame and other plant oils breathing in steam or cleaning the nostrils with salty water can kill sarscov2 before it reaches the lungs “the popularity of false information about remedies and ways to kill the virus is in my opinion a response to the knowledge gaps around covid19” says summer chen she is chief editor at the centre which was set up in two thousand and eighteen by two nonprofit organizations in taiwan taiwan media watch and the association for quality journalism some who share myths are simply misguided but others are driven by profit in march the us food and drug administration warned companies and individuals including alex jones owner of the fakenews website infowars and televangelist jim bakker to stop touting the benefits of unproven covid19 treatments such as colloidal silver both these people have promoted and sold products containing tiny particles of silver suspended in liquid for use against covid19 despite there being no sound evidence that they work another way to profit from fake news is advertising revenue “about half of the disinformation we see is about people trying to produce viral content to get clicks to direct others to a website full of google ads” says giovanni zagni director of facta a new italian factchecking website zagni says the site has focused about 90 of its content on covid19 since its launch on two april many covid19 myths seem to be politically motivated such as the reports that sarscov2 either escaped from the wuhan institute of virology in china or was a bioweapon created deliberately in the country a survey of us residents conducted in midmarch found that 6 thought the virus was accidentally created in a laboratory and 23 that it was developed intentionally chen and her colleagues have attempted to debunk such reports as well as those suggesting the virus was brought to china by people from the united states scientists might have more impact when confronting myths that are less political “if its something crazy like the virus is a bioweapon created by barack obama i think scientists are better off leaving that to others and spending their time in the world of science” says west one way for scientists to help is to make their expertise available to journalists and factcheckers who are debunking misinformation but should scientists attempt to counter misinformation across fields or stick to their own the debate over whether researchers should ‘stay in their lane has at times become heated during the covid19 pandemic coronavirus and covid19 keep up to date in march the ukbased science media centre which provides journalists with comments and briefings from scientists asked its network of experts to stick to their disciplines when responding to media queries about covid19 “especially during a pandemic when theres a sea of misinformation uncertainty and rumours circulating the public needs to hear from scientists with deep expertise who really know what theyre talking about” says chief executive fiona fox others such as west disagree “we should encourage not discourage scientists to ‘step outside their lane especially during a worldwide crisis” he says “as long as they are transparent about their expertise there is much to gain from more scientists thinking about the problem with their different methodological perspectives and experience” the tone of interventions can determine how they are received in march british singer and television personality kerry katona shared an instagram post claiming that children with covid19 would be separated from their parents and taken to hospital alone british doctor and television presenter ranjit singh responded “not true facts are facts ive seen lots of confusion  misinformation about kids  coronavirus recently” and posted a summary of the correct information from the uk royal college of paediatrics  child health katona thanked him and said she felt reassured zagni says that avoiding appearing confrontational or patronizing is key when seeking to change minds “try to have an honest discussion with people about why they chose to share material but dont talk down to people or treat them as stupid most people are engaged in the same search for truth” subtle reminders about accuracy that avoid direct confrontation might prove effective in a study currently awaiting peer review psychologist gordon pennycook at the university of regina in canada showed two groups of people from the united states a series of news headlines about covid19 half of the headlines were true and half were false the participants were not told which was which on average in the first group 47 of the accurate headlines and 43 of the inaccurate ones were considered worth sharing the second group was asked to rate the accuracy of a single headline unrelated to covid19 before performing the same task this seemed to make them more discerning because they went on to say they would consider sharing 50 of the true reports and 40 of the untrue ones many of those who have been inspired to use their training and experience as scientists to protect people from false information about covid19 simply want to contribute to reducing the loss of life and health there could however be other benefits to getting involved in the defence of scientific truth “sharing your work and expertise and engaging with the public is an important part of being a scientist now” says samantha vanderslott a health sociologist at the university of oxford uk “calling out fake stories can raise your profile” zagni cites the example of roberto burioni a doctor and microbiologist at the san raffaele university in milan italy who made a name for himself by standing up to the antivaccination campaigners “if as a scientist interested in communication you establish yourself as a wellrespected voice that fights against bad information you can build a career based on that” says zagni although becoming known as a defender of science might have career benefits there could be downsides “it can help professionally especially for earlycareer researchers but it can also take up days and weeks and it can be hard to return to your research once you get sucked in” says west overall he argues that researchers shouldnt allow professional considerations to get in the way when deciding whether to help in the battle against covid19 misinformation “ultimately it really shouldnt matter because lives and trust in science are at stake and we need to do something about it”|2020-06-17|0.9966|positive|0.07513207637174577|positive

covid19 and the stress of trying to run a publishing company and write during the pandemic i have lost weight the app works but i dont know if the way the police do their job works i know i should just talk about noom and how writers could learn a lot from it but i just got back from a protest and i cant just talk about weight loss and writing so i am going to talk about writing noom and the problems with the police first weight loss is hard and writing to get published is hard in my experience it takes so much trial and error to succeed at these things you try different genres and you try different diets i was the keto guy like three years ago and i guess now i am going to be the noom guy ive done noom for a month and ive lost eight pounds i like that its only eight pounds because its slow and steady and ive learned that slow and steady whether it be writing or weight loss is usually the way to make things stick at the rally i went to today cops were giving out free pizza to the protestorsit made me think of something i learned in noomeating a pizza cant and wont fix our problems despite the momentary comfort it brings i see how doing noom is pretty similar to how i approach writing time routine and consistency matter i dont write on certain days and that is okay just like i sometimes fall off my diet for a day or two as long as i get back to it the day after what helps a lot with writing is i have fellow writers that i check in with to share my progress noom offers someone who checks in on you to see how things are going along with a group of other people also trying to lose weight the writing habits ive developed over time have stuck i dont really fall off the wagon anymore i just write without thinking much about it—its the publishing aspect thats hard for me i also wish weight loss could be easier for me but the noom app has definitely made a difference i first struggled with weight loss a decade ago when i was in my early twenties i had just moved to washington dc with my girlfriend and we had a rough breakup i was also managing a porn store while trying to finish an mfa and start a band i gotta be honest if i knew writing music and weight loss would still be a struggle years later maybe id be doing something else purpose is more important than hardship i didnt just learn that writing and weight loss were hard while working at the porn store i also learned there was a real toxicity within the police force the northeast dc and maryland cops liked to hang out at the porn store a lot probably because the conservative owner of the store thought it was a great idea to give free porn rentals to them most of these cops would walk in and act like assholes they were just like the bullies from high school—no matter what race they were there was just this disdain for noncops and even the community they served there was a rottenness that emanated off them this was also the only time i ever snitched because a lot of these cops wouldnt return the free rentals i feel like snitching is always wrong except when you are calling out cops ironically these guys thought they were above most rules and laws there was something about the culture of cops that felt off outweighing anything positive but what about the good cops i did meet a “good” cop ill call him officer j a young africanamerican from the dc area who also struggled with his weight we both got addicted to the ethiopian and caribbean food in the neighborhood which was mostly african american and ethiopian he was supposed to walk around and patrol the area which seemed more like military occupation than policing instead of doing that hed hang out in the porn store and watch comedy specials officer j did the bare minimum in all areas he would hang out while i worked on my novel and read i wouldnt say we were friends—more like work colleagues he was a good guy and ironically his lack of motivation set him apart from the other cops but i wouldnt say he was a good cop i noticed cops like officer j didnt want to troll the block which a lot of the other cops loved to do he didnt want to make waves and made sure to stay cool with the other cops he wouldnt even help me get back the damn porno tapes that my boss was going to make me pay for the ‘good cops like j just wanted their pay and pension and to not get involved with the messy and problematic politics of the job the cops that actually liked being cops were the ones who always started shit who really relished the militarized aspects of the job cops who let a toxic culture and historical systemic racism force or maybe allow them to be less a part of the community even those of the same race and more a authoritarian force at the rally i went to today cops were giving out free pizza to the protestors it appeared to be a nice act a way to bring goodwill but it made me think of something i learned in noom we turn to food like pizza to assuage the bad feelings we have and erase the guilt and anxiety we feel eating a pizza cant and wont fix our problems despite the momentary comfort it brings i am not saying i have the answers about how to reform the police but a fucking pizza isnt going to bring back all the innocent black lives that have been lost i wish there was an app to help like with dieting or writing but its going to take moving mountains for the police to demilitarize and it will involve change on a local state and federal level to reform an institution many people feel does more harm than good on the scales of justice there is too much dead weight to feel good about how the police do their job|2020-06-17|0.9807|positive|0.14477406488642447|positive

a new breed of researcher is turning to computation to understand society — and then change it|elizaveta sivak spent nearly a decade training as a sociologist then in the middle of a research project she realized that she needed to head back to school sivak studies families and childhood at the national research university higher school of economics in moscow in 2015 she studied the movements of adolescents by asking them in a series of interviews to recount ten places that they had visited in the past five days a year later she had analysed the data and was feeling frustrated by the narrowness of relying on individual interviews when a colleague pointed her to a paper analysing data from the copenhagen networks study a groundbreaking project that tracked the socialmedia contacts demographics and location of about 1000 students with fiveminute resolution over five months1 she knew then that her field was about to change “i realized that these new kinds of data will revolutionize social science forever” she says “and i thought that its really cool” with that sivak decided to learn how to program and join the revolution now she and other computational social scientists are exploring massive and unruly data sets extracting meaning from societys digital imprint they are tracking peoples online activities exploring digitized books and historical documents interpreting data from wearable sensors that record a persons every step and contact conducting online surveys and experiments that collect millions of data points and probing databases that are so large that they will yield secrets about society only with the help of sophisticated data analysis over the past decade researchers have used such techniques to pick apart topics that social scientists have chased for more than a century from the psychological underpinnings of human morality to the influence of misinformation to the factors that make some artists more successful than others one study uncovered widespread racism in algorithms that inform healthcare decisions2 another used mobilephone data to map impoverished regions in rwanda3 “the biggest achievement is a shift in thinking about digital behavioural data as an interesting and useful source” says markus strohmaier a computational social scientist at the gesis leibniz institute for the social sciences in cologne germany not everyone has embraced that shift some social scientists are concerned that the computer scientists flooding into the field with ambitions as big as their data sets are not sufficiently familiar with previous research another complaint is that some computational researchers look only at patterns and do not consider the causes or that they draw weighty conclusions from incomplete and messy data — often gained from socialmedia platforms and other sources that are lacking in data hygiene the epic battle against coronavirus misinformation and conspiracy theories the barbs fly both ways some computational social scientists who hail from fields such as physics and engineering argue that many socialscience theories are too nebulous or poorly defined to be tested this all amounts to “a power struggle within the socialscience camp” says marc keuschnigg an analytical sociologist at linköping university in norrköping sweden “who in the end succeeds will claim the label of the social sciences” but the two camps are starting to merge “the intersection of computational social science with traditional social science is growing” says keuschnigg pointing to the boom in shared journals conferences and study programmes “the mutual respect is growing also” in 2007 a small group of scientists with big ambitions convened a meeting to discuss the emerging art of socialscience data crunching they wanted to apply their skills to change the world during his talk political scientist gary king at harvard university in cambridge massachusetts said that the deluge of digital information “will make it possible to learn far more about society and to eventually start solving — actually solving — the major problems that affect the wellbeing of human populations” by then a smattering of computational socialscience studies had already been published a two thousand and six study had looked at the role of social influence on the popularity of music by creating an artificial online music market used by 14341 people the participants chose songs to download sometimes with and sometimes without information about how popular those songs were among their fellow market users the study found that the popularity of a song became harder to predict the more that users were influenced by others behaviour4 offering one explanation for why it is difficult to predict runaway success two years later a study analysed the movements of 100000 mobilephone users over six months and found that people travel in simple and reproducible patterns5 the authors could calculate the likelihood of finding an individual in any particular location and suggested that identifying similarities in travel patterns across a community could help with urban planning understanding the spread of disease or preparing for emergencies that same year the technology magazine wired published an article6 arguing that the era of big data would spell an end to theory across the sciences although widely criticized as an oversimplification the article struck a nerve more than a decade later social scientists repeatedly invoke the wired article as a signal that the relevance of socialscience theory was under attack but big data only continued its ascendancy to duncan watts a sociologist at the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia the changes in social science were reminiscent of what happened in biology during the 1990s when highthroughput techniques began generating reams of data about dna sequences and gene expression “there was this avalanche in new data that required thinking about data in a very different way” he says but many conventional social scientists were unimpressed by the initial fruits of the revolution and found some of its methods questionable sceptics viewed studies of social media as experiments conducted on thousands of unknowing and unconsenting participants in 2018 news broke that the british consulting firm cambridge analytica had gathered data from millions of facebook accounts without the consent of their owners the aftermath of the scandal continues to bring added scrutiny and scepticism to socialmedia research and some scientists have had their projects stymied as platforms institute new privacy policies the field was also stigmatized by early papers that addressed ‘toy problems — questions that could be answered from the data but did not address longstanding fundamental issues in the social sciences such as how to tackle inequality or influence public opinion “there were a lot of twitter studies in the beginning that i think social scientists were not very excited about” says claudia wagner also a computational social scientist at the gesis leibniz institute for the social sciences some argue that the embrace of toy problems was at least in part the product of a young field finding its feet as analyses have become more sophisticated and data sources more diverse the field has started tackling more important issues such as the roots of discrimination inequality and radicalization says strohmaier “only now are we getting the kind of data that allow us to look at the big issues” he says last year for example researchers from public health and from behavioural economics used healthcare records for more than 50000 patients in a us healthcare system to analyse a commonly used algorithm that recommends people with complex medical needs for extra supervision and health interventions the team used modelling to show that the algorithm was systematically discriminating against black people — potentially influencing the care of millions of people2 the researchers then used knowledge of healthcare disparities in the united states to track down the sources of that bias and to suggest ways to remove it for example algorithms shouldnt assume that the amount spent on an individuals health care is a good proxy for how much care they need because of unequal access to health care less money is typically spent caring for black americans than white americans even when they have the same healthcare needs but access to good data isnt the only challenge scientists migrating from physics or computer science stand accused of failing to examine the theories that social scientists have formulated to explain human behaviour “they tend to look for patterns” says giulia andrighetto who trained as a philosopher but is now a computational social scientist at the institute of cognitive sciences and technologies part of italys national research council in rome “but typically they dont look for the mechanisms through which those behaviours are generated” to do that work requires a firm grasp of socialscience theory jisun an a computational social scientist at hamad bin khalifa university in doha started her phd in computer science in 2010 studying news sharing on social media just as the computational socialscience movement began to bloom at the start she worked only with other computer scientists and they struggled to wrap their heads around different socialscience theories now she collaborates with political scientists to study the influence of the media on public opinion — and vice versa — as well as how to encourage people to boost the diversity of their news sources “over time each side is understanding the other in terms of language and methods” says an there are now concrete signs of engagement the first major conference bringing together the two approaches is scheduled for 2021 universities are also creating institutes that bring

vesicles secreted by stem cells might give clinicians a safer and simpler alternative to cell therapy but researchers are still grappling with how best to prepare and study these tiny particles|it all seemed so straightforward at first stem cells are renowned for their capacity to develop into a wide range of other cell types and researchers have spent decades exploring the notion that adult stem cells could be transplanted to form healthy new tissue in diseased or damaged organs but by the early 2000s it had become apparent that stemcell biology was more complicated than initially believed michael chopp a neuroscientist at the henry ford health system in detroit michigan was among the first to explore the potential for adult stem cells — most notably a subtype known as either mesenchymal stem or mesenchymal stromal cells mscs — to mitigate the effects of spinalcord injury stroke and other neurological trauma “we looked at whats really going on and we knew that the cells were not actually replacing the tissue” says chopp rather he and others hypothesized these cells were repairing tissue by means of secreted factors today the evidence points strongly to exosomes — a class of tiny membrane bubbles known more generally as extracellular vesicles which routinely bud off from cells and carry within them a cornucopia of biomolecules including rna proteins and lipids “we found very quickly that we can recapitulate what the mscs do with the vesicles that are derived from mscs” says mario gimona head of good manufacturing practice at the paracelsus medical university in salzburg austria accordingly many erstwhile celltherapy researchers have shifted gear to explore whether exosomes might deliver the same clinical benefits without the potential risks associated with infusions of living cells such as immune rejection or tumour formation the early data hint at the potential to mitigate cardiovascular neurological and immunological disorders but exosome researchers are also coming to terms with the limits of their knowledge about how and why these little blobs work exosomes were first described in the late 1980s and researchers subsequently teased out their role as a means of communication between cells but it was only in two thousand and ten that saikiang lim a cell biologist at the astar institute of molecular and cell biology in singapore homed in on exosomes as the enigmatic secreted factor underlying mscmediated tissue repair1 initially lim was surprised she had expected the causative factor to be a protein or small molecule so the identification of these strange vesicles sent her scrambling back to the literature “the exosomes discovered us rather than us discovering exosomes” she says but the finding made sense exosomes tend to be laden with nonproteincoding rna molecules that can strongly modulate gene expression “any given type of extracellular vesicle might contain more than 30000 different species of noncoding rnas” says eduardo marbán a cardiologist at cedarssinai medical center in los angeles california this payload — alongside the diverse proteins and other biomolecules also found in exosomes — make these tiny droplets a potent engine for regulating cell biology marbáns group demonstrated in two thousand and fourteen that blocking the release of exosomes by heartderived stem cells eliminated the cells therapeutic effects in injured mouse hearts2 at around the same time exosomes made their clinical debut3 dietrich beelen a transplant doctor at the university of duisburgessen in germany was interested in using mscs to treat a patient with severe graftversushost disease gvhd this condition arises when transplanted bone marrow triggers a damaging immune response against the host tissue that can ultimately lead to organ failure and death some studies had indicated that mscs might quell this immune backlash but beelen was concerned about the uneven track record of these cells in the clinic so he teamed up with colleague bernd giebel a stemcell biologist to dose a patient with mscderived exosomes instead the results were remarkable the patients inflammation subsided dramatically and she achieved a greatly improved quality of life that persisted until she ultimately died from possible steroidrelated complications “she was stable for more than four months” says giebel the treatment was a oneoff permitted on compassionate grounds in subsequent years exosomes have seldom been tested in the clinic but the preclinical data consistently indicate the feasibility of using exosomebased treatments to manage not just gvhd but a host of disorders ashok shetty who studies regenerative medicine at texas am university in college station has shown that mscderived exosomes could mitigate the damage from prolonged epileptic seizures in rodents4 according to shetty when exosomes are delivered nasally they permeate the animals entire forebrain within six hours “we found that we could rescue cognitive function and also prevent abnormal neurogenesis in the brain” he says and as in gvhd the exosomes also seemed capable of modulating inflammation in their investigations of stroke and traumatic brain injury chopp and colleagues have found that exosome treatments in animals spur regeneration and remodelling of neural tissue56 “youll find this whole restorative tapestry occurring throughout the central nervous system” he says “we can actually restore neurologic motor and cognitive function” similarly marbáns group has tested cardiac stem cells and their exosomes as a treatment for people with duchenne muscular dystrophy to prevent the heart damage that is a major cause of death for those with the disease not only did both the stem cell and exosome treatments protect heart function7 but they also promoted muscle repair throughout the bodies of treated mice “the skeletal muscles from the leg were working more forcefully in animals that received the treatments in the heart” says marbán “it seems entirely consistent with the idea that systemic effects of exosomes are responsible for the benefits from the stem cells” exosomes might be able to deliver the therapeutic benefits of stem cells without the baggage that has impeded the latters translation into the clinic exosomes cannot selfreplicate or form tumours in addition they are small enough for filtration to produce sterile material for use in patients and stable enough for longterm freezer storage current data also suggest that the vesicles are remarkably safe “we can use ten or twenty times the therapeutic dose without seeing an adverse reaction” says lim referring to the number of exosomes required to deliver a clinical benefit despite the many therapeutic benefits that have now been attributed to exosomes derived from mscs the mechanisms behind these effects remain frustratingly opaque exosomes seem to influence multiple components of the immune system but to understand how they do this researchers must carefully comb through their molecular cargo holds much of the focus so far has been on microrna — short strands of rna that encode no proteins themselves but can modulate the amount of protein produced by other genes bioinformatic analysis of the material found within exosomes can help to identify strands of microrna that act on diseaserelevant cellular pathways for example marbán found that one particular microrna mir181b accounts for many of the therapeutic effects of exosomes derived from cardiac stem cells8 some researchers are seeking to manipulate mscderived exosomes to carry not just naturally occurring micrornas but also synthetic rna drugs raghu kalluri a cancer biologist at the university of texas md anderson cancer center in houston has extensively studied the natural role of exosomes in driving and impeding the progression and spread of tumours now he is repurposing these vesicles to deliver engineered rna molecules that selectively shut off genes that drive cancer growth “we had a mouse which had pancreatic tumours and those tumours were accumulating high numbers of exosomes so we asked what can we deliver there” he says they opted for a therapeutic rna molecule that inactivates a gene called kras a wellknown driver of pancreatic cancer9 “we found dramatic responses” says kalluri “the tumours were smaller and the mice lived significantly longer” his team is now looking to apply a similar strategy to glioma — another hardtotreat tumour some controversy surrounds the therapeutic contributions of microrna relative to other biomolecules carried in exosomes marbán has found that rnadepleting chemical treatments eliminate many of the therapeutic effects of his exosomes but he notes that micrornas represent just a portion of the poorly understood rna molecules in these particles and that nonmicrorna species could have a yetunderappreciated beneficial role “theres a lot of things in there we dont even know how to classify” he says lim in particular has called the micrornacentric model of exosome function into question10 on the basis of initial evidence that proteins might exhibit more potent biological activity in therapeutic exosomes than doesrna she carefully profiled the molecular inventories of various msc exosome preparations and concluded that “there was just not enough rna to see an effect — most micrornas are present at only about one copy per exosome” because exosomes also contain many enzymes that can greatly accelerate biological processes with just a few molecules she thinks these could exert a more rapid and direct therapeutic effect than microrna giebel too is receptive to a more proteinoriented perspective he points to several factors that could confound efforts to experimentally link an individual microrna to an exosomes effects for example manipulations that knock out a microrna gene in mscs might also disrupt the function of those stem cells and perturb their exosome output to an extent that far surpasses just the loss of that single microrna as a cargo molecule but giebel also hesita|2020-06-17|0.7018|positive|0.10413532146865477|positive
a yellow fluorescent sensor to study the brain and the joy and pain of climbing|in a photo on kaspar podgorskis blog he grips a mountainside with a few fingers as he scopes out his next move this neuroscientist and fellow at janelia research campus is a serious climber he talks science when climbing with his favorite climbing partner also a researcher science and climbing do not overlap much but they have some aspects in common “i love them both very much” he says “theres a lot of trying to do things that are hard and getting a lot of joy out of failing at things that are hard” right now climbing is not on his schedule nor the outdoor photography he enjoys and as of this interview janelia labs were closed because of covid19 he does computing tasks related to his projects and rows on the potomac also to stay fit for his next climb he and his colleagues have developed jycamp for twophoton microscopy its a yellow genetically encoded calcium indicator that excites at frequencies between 1030 and 1040 nanometers the team tested jycamp for example by recording from neurons in the visual cortex in mice they labeled presynaptic axons coming from the thalamus to the visual cortex and labeled cortical neurons there too recording from this location in sequential experiments would miss plenty he says the alternative is one laser beam that excites calcium indicators emitting at different wavelengths in testing they found jycamp “coexcites really well” with red fluorescent sensors they have shared jycamp with other labs where it fills spectral gaps or helps in imaging multiple areas of the brain “i actually i love getting feedback from folks that are using our tools” he says parallelized twophoton microscopes take much excitation power to image many points in the brain simultaneously “by exciting more points at the same time we can speed up imaging” he says this isnt doable with tunable lasers for a reasonable price but it works with lower cost fiber lasers his group needed a sensor that worked with wavelengths above 1000 nanometers “thats easier said than done” he says to get a bright yellow they used wellknown mutations that turn gfps into yfps and inserted them into the widely used jgcamp7 “and we got an indicator thats still green” he says a different tack with random mutagenesis and highthroughput screening was needed and they wanted to detect a mere onenanometer spectral difference and assess other properties too they built a largefieldofview microscope with two cameras for screening tens of thousands of colonies at a time and that was able to detect very narrow filtered wavelengths of the emission spectrum they pulled out promising ones and tested aspects such as brightness and response “its important in these screens not to be greedy” he says one property might look great but other properties such as good expression in the cell matter too podgorskis overarching goal is to one day “get at how neurons compute” by recording comprehensively the inputs into neurons and understanding how the inputs are transformed into outputs this involves building microscopes developing indicators and devising algorithms he grew up in toronto and studied physics at the university of toronto with a biology scholarship he poked around to combine neuroscience and artificial intelligence “i sort of moved away from the wellformulated welldefined problems of physics and math and towards the sort of messy illdefined challenges of neurobiology” then he moved to vancouver to spend time climbing and decide whats next he held two parttime jobs in university of british columbia labs one involved software development for visual analytics the other neurosciencebased data analysis with kurt haas he joined the haas lab as a phd student podgorski was excited about the people he met at a conference at janelia an inquiry about a postdoctoral fellowship turned into an invitation to apply as a fellow a junior ‘lab head post that he landed in 2015 “my whole life changed at that point” he says podgorski “is one of the smartest and funniest people i know” says haas “he has a unique ability to absorb and apply everything effortlessly” he has improved multiple different technologies to advance fast neural imaging “podgorski approaches all tasks with the same vigor whether climbing and setting new routes on mountain walls or overcoming research hurdles in the lab” haas sought to record all the synaptic input and action potential output activity of a neuron in an intact and awake brain to get closer to understanding among other aspects how information sculpts neuronal morphology “kaspar had no experience in designing and building microscopes but within a short time constructed an ultrafast randomaccess twophoton microscope complete with driver and analysis software” he says this was likely the first microscope to fully image sensoryevoked activity throughout a neuron in an awake brain “after he left my lab to take his fellow position at janelia it has taken the combined skills of four new hires in my lab to be able to carry on his work”|2020-06-18|0.9982|positive|0.08941587691587694|positive

transferred to a governmentdesignated hospital for centralized isolation on admission oneonone interviews were conducted by clinicians to corroborate the asymptomatic claims after this screening seventeen individuals were excluded for mild or atypical symptoms clinicians conduct daily symptom screening once an individual is admitted to the hospital four to seventeen days after admission six of these fortythree previously asymptomatic individuals developed symptoms and were recategorized as symptomatic finally thirtyseven individuals with asymptomatic infections were informed about the study and consented to be included in this study it was unclear whether individuals who present with asymptomatic infection might progress to clinical disease during the early phase of the sarscov2 epidemic in china therefore chinese clinicians chose to administer interferonalpha ifnα inhalation antiviral treatment ribavirin orally and supportive treatment treatment to strengthen immunity such as thymopentin and chinese medicine to avoid possible aggravation according to the covid19 treatment guidelines 5th edition from the national institutes of health of china published on february 8 2020

presentations chest ct laboratory tests treatment and outcome data were collected from inpatient medical records laboratory data collected for each patient included complete blood count coagulation profile serum biochemical tests including renal and liver function electrolytes lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase serum ferritin and biomarkers of infection chest ct scans were done for all inpatients to identify sarscov2 infection nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at least twice and tested by rt–pcr rna from all samples was isolated within twentyfour h viral rna samples were extracted according to manufacturer instructions using the nucleotide acid extraction kit daan gene registration no 20170583 which based on an automated magnetic bead purification procedure a commercial rt–pcr kit daan gene registration no 20203400063 was used for testing samples for sarscov2 briefly two target genes including open reading frame1ab orf1ab and nucleocapsid protein n were simultaneously

greater than forty were defined as positive and negative respectively for both genes samples with ct values from thirtyseven to forty were defined as inconclusive and a second test was needed starting one week after admission nasopharyngeal samples were tested by rt–pcr every 2–3 d for the remainder of the hospitalization period patients with one positive rt–pcr result were defined as patients with sarscov2 infection patients with two consecutive negative rt–pcr results were defined as sarscov2 negative a confirmed case of covid19 was defined as an individual with nasopharyngeal swabs that were positive for sarscov2 using laboratorybased pcr the symptomatic patients were defined as patients with laboratoryconfirmed covid19 with symptoms such as fever cough sore throat and sputum an asymptomatic case was defined as an individual with a positive nucleic acid test result but without any relevant clinical symptoms in the preceding fourteen d and during hospitalization a close contact was defined as 1 anyone who had been within approximately six feet 2 meters of a person infected with sarscov2 for longer than ten min and 2 those who had direct contact with the infectious secretions of a covid19 patient close contact can occur while caring for living with visiting or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with patients with covid19 the duration of shedding was calculated as the number of days from the first positive nasopharyngeal sample to the last positive sample based on rt–pcr testing the last positive sample was followed by a negative rt–pcr result on two sequential tests detection of igg and igm against sarscov2 igg and igm against sarscov2 were detected in plasma samples using magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay kits bioscience according to the manufacturers instructions briefly recombinant antigens containing the nucleoprotein and a peptide lqpeldsfkeeldkyfknhtspdvd from the spike protein of sarscov2 were immobilized on magnetic particles a codonoptimized spike s that lacked the cterminal nineteen amino acids was used to generate a luciferaseexpressing pseudovirus the sarscov2 pseudovirus neutralization assay was carried out on 293t cells expressing ace2 in a 96well plate paired dilute sera 1600 from an individual one serum sample from the acute phase and another serum sample from the convalescent phase were obtained equal volumes of sarscov2 pseudovirus were added and the plates were preincubated at thirtyseven °c for one h then 293t cells expressing ace2 were incubated with one hundred μl of serapseudovirus mixture for twentyfour h three days after infection the cells were lysed with thirty μl of lysis buffer promega to measure the pseudoviral transduction relative luminescence units of luciferase activity were detected using the luciferase assay kit promega according to the manufacturers instructions experiments were repeated twice the luciferase activity was determined by glomax microplate luminometer promega the neutralization rate  was calculated as following the sera of patients with laboratoryconfirmed sarscov2 infections asymptomatic group n  thirtyseven and symptomatic group n  37 were collected as early as possible during hospitalization the sera of healthy individuals n  37 were included as control groups the concentrations of fortyeight cytokines and chemokines

the aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in covid19 patients and to determine the association of acute kidney injury aki with the severity and prognosis of covid19 patients the electronic databas…|our metaanalysis showed that renal impairment in patients with covid19 is common the manifestations of kidney damage are diverse ranging from abnormal urine analysis elevated scr or bun levels to aki and renal failure for which crrt is required among these renal impairments abnormal urine analysis is the most frequent 572 patients have proteinuria in which mild proteinuria  as well as moderate or severe proteinuria  to  account for 388 and 106 respectively chengs study has found that compared with patients without proteinuria patients with proteinuria and  to  had a 15fold and fivefold increased risk of death respectively indicating that proteinuria is an independent risk factor for inhospital death of covid19 patients 2 so more attention should be paid to urine analysis in clinical practice another main kidney damage manifestation was elevated scr and bun levels with incidence rate of 96 and 137 respectively elevated scr and bun levels may be due to chronic kidney disease or aki chengs study showed that the baseline scr was elevated in 155 covid19 patients on admission patients with elevated baseline of scr were more likely to develop aki and more severe aki meanwhile elevated baseline scr and bun levels was an independent risk factor for hospital mortality 2 therefore we should increase more awareness to covid19 patients who had elevated baseline scr our metaanalysis showed that the averaged incidence of aki was 45 ranging from 13 to 364 dependent on the different severity of the illness the exact pathogenesis of covid19associated aki is unclear based on the results of our metaanalysis in combination with our frontline experience we consider that the etiology of renal impairment is likely to be diverse and multifactorial besides the direct attack by the sarscov2 hypoxia and hypercoagulability also contribute to kidney damage it has been reported that in the kidney angiotensinconverting enzyme2 ace2 is highly expressed in the brush border of proximal tubular cells but not in glomerular endothelial and mesangial cells 29 which could explain the fact that the main feature of kidney injury is the damage of renal tubules zhongs team in guangzhou has also successfully isolated sarscov2 from the urine sample of an infected patient 30 it also has been found in the kidney biopsy that sarscov2 antigens accumulated in kidney tubules in situ 31 32 these evidences supported the notion that sarscov2 can directly attack human kidney in addition covid19 patients exhibit obvious hypoxia symptoms and renal tubules are more susceptible to ischemia and hypoxia compared to glomeruli moreover covid19 patients mainly showed hypercoagulant states with elevated levels of ddimer leading to the slow blood flow velocity in the capillaries around the renal tubules and increased risk of microthrombus formation as confirmed by autopsy results 33 in contrast to the previous study showing that median time for the occurrence of aki from symptom onset were twenty and sixteen days in sars and mers patients respectively 1 cheng et al have found that aki developed six days after admission in most covid19 patients while only two days after admission in patients with elevated baseline of scr 2 our metaanalysis also revealed that the incidence of aki was more than fivefold higher in severe cases and nonsurvivors than that in nonsevere cases and survivors since severe covid19 is commonly complicated with ards which has high demand for fluid management optimizing fluid volume and maintaining hemodynamic stability are crucial to prevent the occurrence or progression of aki in addition appropriate anticoagulant therapy might help to reduce the microthrombus formation and to alleviate renal injury our metaanalysis also showed 156 nonsurvivors received crrt while 04 survivors needed crrt which indicated that covid19 patients complicated with aki have a poor prognosis once crrt is applied as existing studies have not provided detailed information about survivors and nonsurvivors experiencing crrt further research is needed to determine whether early renal replacement therapy could improve the prognosis of covid19 patients complicated with aki the number of studies included was limited in terms of sample size data availability and methodologic quality as most of the patients were from china it will be better to include more studies with a broad geographic scope to get a more comprehensive understanding of acute renal impairment in covid19 in addition more detailed patient information particularly regarding the risk of aki and the relationship of comorbidities with aki was not available in most studies at the time of analyses another limitation of this study is that some articles have provided median and interquartile ranges but not mean and standard deviation of the scr and bun values the mean and standard deviation for those data has been estimated in this study based on the median and the interquartile range which might lead to inaccuracy to some extent|2020-06-18|-0.9721|negative|0.1327834044065387|positive

have changed and in a number of ways if you feel like shopify has been dropping huge disruptive news bombs practically each week now youre right and whod have guessed that in the uk the exclusively online supermarket ocado is now worth more than brickandmortar grocers morrisons sainsburys and marks and spencer combined the speed of transformation in ecommerce since the covid19 outbreak an already fastpaced industry has been savage supply chains are under strain for many brands selling online especially where demand is high and supplies are low how do you best manage expectations and maximize every opportunity to sell to your target audience with your consumers now relying on the world of online shopping more than ever how can you be sure youre getting your fair share of that online retail pie well this post is designed to help you answer precisely these questions whether your sales have taken a hit or you have “off the wall” levels of demand here are some ideas to help you navigate that bounce back and to help customers stay in love with your brand your site search is a goldmine of insight especially right now seriously frequently checking in to understand how and what your customers are looking for once they get to your store can reveal a bunch of opportunities its possible that before covid19 took a stronghold on everyday life customers had different contexts in mind when searching for your products for example searches for “gloves” today vs in january are likely to be visitors searching for two separate products entirely its important to ensure that youre serving todays customer sufficiently and addressing their context correctly to remain relevant and to improve conversion heres an extreme example but its a poignant one nonetheless for context holland and barrett are a popular high street healthcare retailer with a strong web presence here in the uk when searches for “coronavirus” had skyrocketed and demand for hand sanitizer and paracetamol another brand of acetaminophen like tylenol were painfully high what i found incredible was that searching for “coronavirus” on their website yielded no results this seemed particularly jarring for a retailer that first sells items that have been scientifically proven to kill and help prevent the spread of the virus and second is a dedicated healthcare business not only does this throw a huge wrench in the works when it comes to cx and customer perception this tiny yet costly oversight is likely to have cost them sales and customers too customers are also searching for products that arent typically associated with a certain brand or online store due to exhausted stocks elsewhere for example the top three search terms for one of my ecommerce clients are now mask mask and ppe the search terms “mask” “ppe” and close variants were practically nonexistent prior to midmay kit and ace a clothing retailer has responded to precisely this changing behavior after seeing a huge spike in the number of site searches for masks theyre now introducing a new premium scientificallyderived mask that also fits their brand theyre donating 100 of profits from the masks but this tactic will likely to drive more sales in their other categories too this is a great move especially since apparel sales have shrunk during this time its important to find emerging opportunities when typical product lines are no longer in demand the point im trying to make here is that in order to succeed coming out of the other side of this pandemic you need to ensure youre fully in tune with the wants and needs of todays customer — whatever that looks like for you using site search can absolutely give you a huge window into their demands and interests if products are out of stock offer excellent alternatives where possible as touched on earlier supply chain management is going to be increasingly challenging — especially in areas where demand is outstripping supply — yet so many retailers miss out here for some products it doesnt matter how hard you try every retailer has them listed as “out of stock” for branded items that have stock issues globally being the retailer that offers a perfectly good alternative could be enough to win over that visitor and win the sale that other retailers have lost to use a specific example ftx is a manufacturer of radiocontrolled cars and is a brand sold on europe ecommerce site wheelspin theres an ftx item that you cannot get before the end of june for love nor money on any website due to covid19 the pandemic has forced factories to close and that disrupts production for many goods specifically in this example its the ftx brushed motor thats become victim to supply chain issues however theres a brand that has a perfectly suitable alternative item thats identical in specification and its in stock proactively offering solid alternatives with as few compromises as possible can be a great way of winning sales and delighting customers in a way that your competitors likely wont be continuing on the topic of store stock and managing a turbulent supply chain a simple but welcome feature is to add an “items in stock” filter it goes without saying that allowing customers to browse items theyre able to get their hands on quickly will go down well and could help improve conversion on your website another benefit of adding such a filter is the ability to bring light to other lines that are typically overshadowed by more popular but now out of stock items taking this a step further you could also help your customers experience by adding a filter for products expected to arrive within a certain timeframe or filter out those that can be backordered add an “email me when back in stock” cta if youre a retailer struggling to get stock of popular lines theres a good chance youre not the only retailer with that problem although it may not be possible to get stock any quicker than your competitors you can absolutely ensure that youre the first to let potential customers know that its back in stock sweeten the deal by personalizing the backinstock email letting a potential customer know that the items back in stock is great but why not suprise and delight your customers by taking the opportunity to personalize this email too offering personalized crosssells of the item thats now back in stock can be a great way to not only give them the good news but give them additional reasons to visit your shop and potentially increase basket value simultaneously its certainly a win win here remarket to people when items are back in stock people are spending more time online — fact so it makes sense to reach your audience where theyre most likely to be spending time for the foreseeable future depending on the popularity of an item and how much traffic is going to it whilst its remained unavailable you could create a retargeting list based on visitors that expressed an interest in it now that its back in stock this can prove to be a great way to reach people say on social media that arent particularly responsive to email but are spending increased amounts of time on their favorite social platforms although this may not be scalable or at least i havent found a way to make it so doing this across your topselling lines or lines with greater margins could prove to be a successful way of pulling engaged and semiinvested visitors back to your site dont be afraid to increase prices where necessary lets not forget the basic principles of commerce right high demand coupled with low supply increases prices businesses shouldnt feel guilty for increasing prices but of course theres a difference between a justifiable increase and straight ripping people off as demonstrated below for context four tins of 400g heinz spaghetti plus sausage would retail at around £4 in uk supermarkets thats about 5 at current exchange rates think about this scenario for a second you and your staff are potentially working in environments that could pose serious health risks plus theres additional costs to consider in order to keep people safe ppe cleaning products masks sick pay for unwell staff etc all these factors will push up the cost per sale and erode your margins equally there are no guarantees right now those alltime high levels of sales could come slamming to a fierce halt at any time whether thats caused by a change in demand decrease in stock or your business is no longer able to fulfil orders due to an internal covid19 outbreak increasing prices fairly to better protect your business against these mostly uncontrollable factors is not a bad thing in my opinion its just good business sense youve got to ensure your business is as robust as it can be when faced with these potential eventualities increasing your prices fairly can help to better protect it discover creative ways to connect with your audience as the saying goes “when life gives you lemons make lemonade” its a huge cliché but it absolutely rings true and remains a powerful statement today finding ways to be creative cut through the noise and engage with your audience is essential to staying relevant especially if your customers cash is heading elsewhere right now heres an example of a potentially powerful idea that ive been working on for a client in the world of apparel — one of the more fiercely affected industries during the pandemic people are spending less on fashion and even less at the luxury end of the scale so why not let your audience build themselves a virtual dream wardrobe something theyd consider buying for a nig|2020-06-18|0.9998|positive|0.21484670136355535|positive
|we appreciate dr stahls insightful letter with valuable information regarding the effect on viral antibodies with therapeutic plasma exchange tpe 6 this is an area of concern and the findings are important as we gain knowledge of covid19 and potential therapies the complex host immune response to infection remains a desired target and appears common to covid19 6 the theoretical effect and safety of tpe in sepsis has been supported by limited reports 7 most of these stem from bacterial infection though patel demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety in three pediatric patients during the h1n1 pandemic of two thousand and nine 8 the findings reported by dr stahl are noteworthy however and the potential clinical impact must be considered if considering tpe for sepsis with multiple organ failure due to covid19 as the authors note the effect of tpe goes beyond cytokine removal also replacing consumed protective factors that are critical to maintain circulatory flow and prevent vascular leak 6 this makes tpe unique—and perhaps complementary—to other proposed treatments for sepsis such as remdesivir and convalescent plasma it is our belief that in severe cases of covid and other infections targeted therapy alone may not be sufficient autopsy reports of covid nonsurvivors have demonstrated severe endothelial injury and widespread microthrombosis in the lungs supporting the theoretical role of tpe based on the mechanism of action 9 theory alone does not justify treatment and the gold standard remains prospective randomized controlled trials we eagerly await the results of the exchange trial and applaud the investigators performing this longoverdue study apart from prospective rcts evidence for treatment may come from other sources and should be considered in the context of the available data tpe carries a category three recommendation for sepsis with multiple organ failure in the two thousand and nineteen american society for apheresis guidelines 10 stating decisionmaking should be individualized the clinical challenge at present is identifying those patients likely to benefit with no specific guidance it is our responsibility to apply medical knowledge to the best of our ability and judgment while doing no harm the art of medicine calls for us to consider the risks and benefits of the available scientific evidence so that we fulfill both of these responsibilities as we continue to share our experiences patient care will continue to improve in the meantime we must continue to work using our current evidence and guidelines when providing care|2020-06-18|0.9752|positive|0.04016897081413211|positive
forced displacement is now affecting more than one percent of humanity or one in ninetyseven people and fewer of those who flee are able to return home according to a report issued today by the united nations high commissioner for refugees|the following is a nearverbatim transcript of todays noon briefing by farhan haq deputy spokesman for the secretarygeneral hi everyone its good to be here i have one favour to ask please mute your mics and well have a guest with us amer daoudi shortly after im done with my part of the briefing  covid19 — policy brief on the world of work okay first of all tonight just after midnight the secretarygeneral will release a policy brief on the world of work and covid19 the brief will look at issues such as the dramatic effect that the pandemic is having on the jobs livelihoods and wellbeing of workers and their families as well as on businesses worldwide a video message by the secretarygeneral regarding this issue will also be made available ahead of world refugee day this saturday the secretarygeneral reiterates his commitment to do everything to end the conflict and persecution that drive appalling numbers of refugees nearly eighty million women children and men around the world have been forced from their homes as refugees or internally displaced people including ten million people this past year alone he also recognizes the generosity and humanity of host communities and countries that often struggle with their own economic and security concerns we owe these countries our thanks our support and our investment says the secretarygeneral in a message for the day this year the covid19 pandemic poses an additional threat to refugees and displaced people who are among the most vulnerable refugees and displaced people are also prominent among those who are stepping up to make a difference on the frontlines of the response adds the secretarygeneral today and every day we stand in unity and solidarity with refugees and recognize our fundamental obligation to shelter those fleeing war and persecution he says and in geneva unhcr the un refugee agency published its annual global trends report which shows that forced displacement is now affecting more than one percent of humanity — or one in ninetyseven people the report also shows that fewer of those who flee are able to return home in the 1990s unhcr says that on average 15 million refugees were able to return home each year over the past decade that number has fallen to around 385000 the report also documents worrying new displacement particularly in the democratic republic of the congo the sahel yemen and syria this mornings session of the security council was also dedicated to refugees the head of the un refugee agency filippo grandi said twice as many people are forcibly displaced now than ten years ago this he says is the result of a decade of crises he told members of the council that when leadership fails when multilateralism doesnt live up to its promise the consequences are not felt in the global capitals of our world but rather in the lives of those who have no power among them he said are the refugees and the displaced on the sahel our humanitarian colleagues tell us that the number of people in need of lifesaving assistance and protection has reached twentyfour million this is the highest number ever recorded and half of them are children in the entire region over 45 million people are internally displaced or refugees this is one million more than last year the needs are outpacing the response and in this context it is critical to step up response efforts food insecurity and malnutrition are expected to spike to record peaks more than twelve million people are already facing a serious lack of food the highest figure in a decade the socioeconomic impact of the covid19 outbreak could double this number almost ten million children are at risk of acute malnutrition including three million suffering from its most severe form in march over 11500 schools were closed or nonoperational due to violence across the sahel affecting over 22 million children — with covid19 seventyone million children are temporarily out of school humanitarian access in the sahel has become increasingly difficult growing insecurity deeply affects aid operations the increasingly militarized and politicized response constitutes a major risk to principled humanitarian action funding shortfalls are one of the most significant challenges to adequately deliver assistance five months into 2020 only eighteen per cent of the 28 billion requested for the regions six countries have been funded the additional requirement to respond to the covid19 pandemic stands at 620 million with only thirteen per cent funded turning to yemen a first batch of 10000 covid19 tests arrived in sanaa on a unicefchartered plane today to increase the testing capacity amid the rapid increase of cases in yemen an additional shipment of 8000 tests is expected to arrive in aden in the coming days since the first covid19 case was officially confirmed in yemen on ten april unicef has shipped over 33000 n95 respirators 33000 face shields and 18000 gowns into the country this crucial personal protective equipment will support four hundred frontline health workers for three months but only represents five per cent of the covid19 supplies that unicef requires in yemen unicefs covid19 response in yemen remains severely underfunded so far only ten per cent of unicefs 53 million funding appeal has been received in zambia there are more than 1400 confirmed cases of covid19 and eleven deaths recorded with the pandemic taking a toll on livelihoods and the economy led by the resident coordinator dr coumba mar gadio and with guidance from the world health organization who the un team is supporting the government and is working to mobilize more than 130 million for the uns covid19 emergency appeal which aims to reach 62 million vulnerable people the un team and our partners are working to bolster food security social protection public health education health and water and sanitation the un has provided laboratory supplies and personal protection equipment and has also trained technical staff and improved covid19 surveillance and detection our team has also established two national call centres some 200000 water sanitation and hygiene supplies have been distributed to health facilities and refugee settlements nearly 15000 refugees have received soap and other supplies also the un is providing food assistance to 622000 people in droughtaffected areas supporting small farmers and boosting the supply chain for the governments food assistance programme the un also transported personal protection equipment and testing kits donated by the jack ma foundation every year half of the worlds children — or approximately one billion children — are affected by physical sexual or psychological violence leading to them suffering injuries disabilities and death because countries have failed to follow established strategies to protect them thats according to a new report published today by the world health organization unicef the un educational scientific and cultural organization unesco and the secretarygenerals special representative on violence against children as well as the end violence partnership the head of the who dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said that there is never any excuse for violence against children he urges all countries to implement evidencebased tools to prevent it stressing that protecting the health and wellbeing of our children is central to protecting our collective health and wellbeing now and for the future todays report is the first of its kind and it charts progress in one hundred and fiftyfive countries while nearly all of these countries have laws in place to protect children against violence less than half of them said they are being strongly enforced the new publication also includes the first ever global homicide estimates for children under the age of 18 finding that in 2017 some 40000 children were victims of homicide you can read more about this online and a new un report released today said that sustained and effective efforts in fighting corruption in afghanistan remain critical for the countrys future the fourth annual anticorruption report from the un assistance mission in afghanistan unama describes how anticorruption reforms slowed in 2019 it notes that there were fewer legislative and strategic initiatives undertaken to fight corruption than in previous years the full report is available on unamas website i have a personnel announcement to share with you the secretarygeneral is appointing ms leni stenseth of norway as

richard horton skewers leaders in two of the richest most powerful and scientifically advanced countries for getting it so wrong|the covid19 catastrophe whats gone wrong and how to stop it happening again richard horton polity 2020 since the coronavirus crisis began richard horton editorinchief of leading medical journal the lancet has been tearing across the british public sphere here he is on the bbc the national broadcaster there in the pages of the guardian newspaper — taking the government to task for failures that have left the united kingdom with the worlds secondhighest per capita covid19 death toll so far belgium is top horton has never shied away from controversy his journal published the retracted fraudulent paper by andrew wakefield that alleged a nonexistent link between vaccines with autism or crusades against the iraq war and for political action on climate change in coronavirus he has found a cause that matches his energy the lancet journals are pumping out both the latest research and his pointed critiques of government policy and last month he reviewed a new book by the slovenian marxist philosopher slavoj žižek that imagines economic and social worlds after covid19 now horton has a book of his own the covid19 catastrophe is a sort of history diagnosis and prescription in real time it is wide ranging querying the changing role of international cooperation and the fallout of austerity economics and taking a deeper dive into chinas scientific and political response to the crisis than most western media have offered but the book returns again and again to the catastrophe in both the united kingdom and the united states it is haunted by the question how did two of the richest most powerful and most scientifically advanced countries in the world get it so wrong and cause such ongoing pain for their citizens we were warned what to expect in the pandemic shows healthcare league table the easy answer is in their leadership horton levels the accusation that us president donald trump is committing a “crime against humanity” for defunding the very world health organization that is trying to help the united states and others uk prime minister boris johnson in hortons view either lied or committed misconduct in telling the public that the government was well prepared for the pandemic in fact the uk government abandoned the worldstandard advice to test trace and isolate in march with no explanation then scrambled to ramp up testing in april but repeatedly failed to meet its own targets lagging weeks behind the rest of the world a bbc investigation in april showed that the uk government failed to stockpile neccessary personal protective equipment for years before the crisis and should have been aware that the national health service wasnt adequately prepared politicians are easy targets though horton goes further to suggest that although scientists in general have performed admirably many of those advising the government directly contributed to what he calls “the greatest science policy failure for a generation” again using the united kingdom as an example he suggests that researchers were insufficiently informed or understanding of the crisis unfolding in china and were too insular to speak to chinese scientists directly the model for action at times seemed to be influenza a drastic underestimation of the true threat of the new coronavirus worse as the uk governments response went off the rails in march ostensibly independent scientists would “speak with one voice in support of government policy” keeping up the facade that the country was doing well in hortons view this is a corruption of science policymaking at every level individuals failed in their responsibility to procure the best scientific advice he contends and the advisory regime was too close to — and in sync with — the political actors who were making decisions “advisors became the public relations wing of a government that had failed its people” he concludes the situation deteriorated to the point that former uk chief government scientific adviser david king set up an alternative scientificadvice committee on three may to both be more transparent to the public and exercise the independence of mind and tongue that he felt the official committees had ceded it is a move horton approves its not clear that the group has swayed government policy but it has given the public and the media a stable and open source of scientific information elsewhere the book discusses places with lessegregious failures such as spain and france and the rare successes such as new zealand and kerala in india horton is fond of a tight timeline and after experiencing the past six months through the fragmented lenses of social media and short news reports it is a minor but not insignificant relief just to have all these events collected in one place in order we practised for a pandemic but didnt brace such synthesis is a bulwark too against the blizzard of misinformation — the ‘infodemic — that has blanketed the crisis horton rightly points out that it isnt just quacks and conspiracy theorists promulgating false information there is a chilling effort by governments as well examples include the united kingdoms bizarre recent assertions that it never pursued a ‘herd immunity strategy despite both the prime minister and a scientific adviser discussing it in public and the chinese authorities gagging of physician li wenliang who tried to raise the alarm at the very beginning of the coronavirus outbreak in wuhan the book is weakest where it discusses the future this is unsurprising — no one knows how this calamity will end horton is of the camp that believes there is unlikely to be a return to normality “perhaps covid19 represents an impermeable boundary between one moment of our lives and another we can never go back” he writes his recommendations for the future are largely admirable — a moreconnected and conscientious public a morecommunitarian government a more selfcritical scientific elite but there is little structure or path for getting there i too want the united states to be a better global citizen without a president such as donald trump sadly i struggle to imagine how it will happen like much of the scientific work produced during the pandemic this book is a rushed product — not subject to the exacting standards of more normal times but like the scientific work it is vital and up to the minute early on horton paraphrases the mathematician and writer adam kucharski saying “if youve seen one pandemic youve seen … one pandemic” what is imparted now wont necessarily help us next time and were still in the swell of this one the events the book recounts are barely cold and the powerful whom it critiques are still in power it has lessons that are useful right now|2020-06-18|-0.898|negative|0.07344825809111521|positive

vulnerabilities in times of a pandemic this column taken from a recent vox ebook examines recent experiences and the riskmanagement literature it concludes that it is a mistake to equate selfsufficiency with robustness – putting all the eggs in one basket is still not a good idea it is also a mistake to focus on production location when the imperative is to radically scale up production of vital medical supplies importantly international supply chains will be needed to produce the billions of doses of covid19 vaccine we will soon need to manufacture and distribute with the covid19 crisis a new debate has emerged with respect to global value chains gvcs examining whether excessive globalisation of production has not created new economic vulnerabilities for example beata javorcik recently wrote in the financial times that “businesses will be forced to rethink their global value chains” and that “while justintime manufacturing may be the optimal way of producing a highly complex item such as a car the disadvantages of a system that requires all of its elements to work like clockwork have now been exposed”1 even the world economic forum has recommended to “aggressively evaluate nearshore options to shorten supply chains and increase proximity to customers” as a response to covid192 this column first appeared in the vox ebook covid19 and trade policy why turning inward wont work available to download here while some lessons will have to be drawn and both firms and consumers are likely to make different choices after the crisis it may be premature to call for the end of gvcs or to conclude that shorter supply chains would be less vulnerable this chapter reviews the relevant management and business literature and highlights evidence to show that the relationship between gvcs and resilience or robustness in the supply of inputs is more complicated than it looks even in the midst of the covid19 crisis we see how efficient gvcs are in answering the most urgent needs of countries policies in the future should support business efforts to build more robust and resilient supply chains and not add to health and other dangers a policy risk built on misconceptions about gvcs the vulnerability of supply chains during covid19 what are we exactly talking about when speaking of risk on the supply side firms face risks such as plant fires natural disasters financial risks political instability cyberattacks quality issues with suppliers and delivery failures on the demand side those risks include reputation of products new competitors policies restricting market access macroeconomic crisis and exchange rate volatility covid19 is first and foremost a global health crisis and has impacted the production of firms in gvcs in several ways • production was stopped or disrupted because firms were directly affected by the presence of the virus at production sites whether it was a decision coming from the government or from the firm itself either there was a need to stop producing or to maintain production with new rules guaranteeing the safety of employees with an impact on production such as delays or reduced output this type of risk is related to the production site and applies to all firms in the same location however firms that source inputs from different locations confront an additional risk  even if the virus does not affect the production site they nevertheless need inputs originating from a potentially affected area this is a supply chain risk for example such risk materialised in the fourth week of january two thousand and twenty when china decided to lock down the city of wuhan and start taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus to the rest of the country manufacturing companies in the rest of the world unaware at this stage of the tsunami that was about to hit them were quickly hit car manufacturer hyundai halted all production in korea on seven february two thousand and twenty due to a shortage of components coming out of china this type of contagion flowing through gvcs has also been observed with some natural disasters such as the earthquake and tsunami in japan in 2011 or the floods in thailand that same year within a matter of only a few weeks during february 2020 the virus spread rapidly to other regions first to europe and then to north america such was the speed of its spread that supply chains were hardly disrupted it wasnít until nineteen march that ford stopped its production of cars in both north america and europe and there only four days separated volkswagen closing its factories in europe 17 march and in the us 21 march3 and whether domestic or not suppliers of parts and components also closed their plants because they were affected by similar measures  not because their inputs could not be delivered the contagion became more of a concussion baldwin 2020 transportation is also a source of risk for those companies still producing during the lockdowns and possibly for all companies once lockdowns are lifted and the virus is still present the vulnerability of international supply chains will depend on whether international transportation networks are still operating and without significant increases in trade costs • while limiting trade in goods was not part of the health response with the important exception of export bans and restrictions to trade for some key medical supplies and medicines measures taken by governments limiting the movement of people or reinforcing border controls have to some extent led to the disruption in international trade trade in services is directly impacted when it relies on the movement of consumers eg tourism or the movement of producers eg many business services but also transport services goods are moved across countries through services and trade in goods is indirectly impacted by the measures affecting those services this is especially the case for air freight which has been relying on cargo holds in passenger planes and is favoured during the crisis to reduce the delivery time of key inputs and supplies quarantine measures for air or sea crews and additional sanitary controls related to covid19 or measures to protect the people in charge of controls are also delaying trade while domestic transport networks and logistics are also disrupted there is an additional vulnerability for international freight and a risk specific to international production networks however it is difficult to assess the level of disruption to international trade currently most logistics firms report no strong impact on their operational capabilities with the exception of some air routes or specific destinations that may be more impacted by the virus4 volatility in freight rates has risen but with falling demand international trade costs are more likely to decrease than to increase all the above risks are on the supply side and were mainly the focus of most debates on the level of vulnerability in international supply chains however on the demand side an even greater risk may be on the horizon – culminating in a profound worldwide economic crisis triggered by lockdowns and restrictions to movement of people which also restrict consumers ability to consume contagion through gvcs will again become a concern if regions lift these restrictions sequentially and if the economic impact although profound is more or less severe across different areas the mechanisms which were observed during the 20082009 global financial crisis via contagion through declining demand and amplification effects bems et al 2009 will resurface however the covid19 crisis is of a different nature with the recession likely to stem from services and domestic activities rather be associated than trade finance issues as in 20082009 the macroeconomic implications are also different guerrieri et al 2020 no current evidence that complex supply chains are more impacted by covid19 numerous statements have been made about complex value chains being more impacted during the covid19 crisis possibly due to additional risks and costs related to international trade5 however the available evidence – while limited at this stage ñ does not support such a view the most impacted industries are those relying on the movement of people such as hotels and restaurants or passenger transport and for countries under a lockdown the bulk of the impact is through the fall in domestic demand and not international tourists the most impacted industries are those relying on the movement of people such as hotels and restaurants or passenger transport and for countries under a lockdown the bulk of the impact is through the fall in domestic demand and not international tourists figure one is based on world bank estimates of the economic impact of covid19 made on thailand maliszewska et al 2020 this country is an interesting example due to its integration in manufacturing gvcs as well as tourism activities for each sector the decrease in output is the consequence of some level of underutilisation of capital and labour increase in international trade costs and a decrease in any activities that involve proximity among people as the pandemic is still ongoing these figures are model predictions only and not observed data they are plotted against the import intensity of production which can be interpreted as an index of the level of fragmentation of production timmer et al 2016 data come from the oecd trade in valueadded tiva database figure one import intensity of

articles in the swedish constitution the first guarantees the freedom of movement for swedish citizens ruling out nationwide lockdowns the second establishes unique independence for public agencies allowing them to design the policy response to the pandemic the third grants exceptional powers to local government in addition the swedish approach is fostered by strong trust in the government covid19 has triggered drastic policy measures in many countries including lockdowns and severe restrictions on the freedom of movement of people sweden is one clear exception to this pattern no nationwide mandatory lockdown has been enforced swedes are able to move freely within their country as well as across the swedish border – although they are likely to be stopped from entering other countries true there are restrictions concerning the maximum size of public gatherings restaurants that do not adhere to social distancing rules can be forced to shut down high schools and universities have been closed while daycare facilities and elementary schools have remained open still the public authorities rely essentially on recommendations and information concerning handwashing social distancing selfisolation travelling and working from home rather than on any legally binding measures the swedish approach of keeping an open society during the pandemic has drawn immense international interest why is the policy response in sweden so different many explanations for its exceptionalism have been presented as a rule the main reason for the swedish policy response has not been brought out it is dictated by the legislative framework more precisely by the rules of the constitution concerning the freedom of personal movement and concerning the independence of public authorities and of local authorities a lively debate about the pros and cons of the swedish approach has evolved in terms of public health outcomes however these consequences are not dealt with here instead my focus is solely on the determinants of the swedish policy response to covid19 the economic consequences of the present pandemic are enormous these are determined to a large extent by the measures taken by government authorities which in turn depend on the incentives and restrictions facing policymakers thus the institutional framework for the policymaking process is the key to understanding the whole covid19 story for sweden the role of the constitution two paragraphs in the swedish constitution dictate the character of the policy response the first concerns personal freedom of movement and the second concerns the particular independence enjoyed by public agencies or authorities in addition the constitution gives extensive powers to local government in designing policy measures regarding public health issues in this way limiting the role of the central government the swedish government is not allowed to declare a state of emergency in peacetime thus the main factor behind swedish exceptionalism during the present pandemic is that the swedish constitution prohibits the use of lockdowns as seen from chapter 2 article eight in the swedish constitution regeringsformen everyone shall be protected in their relations with the public institutions against deprivations of personal liberty all swedish citizens shall also in other respects be guaranteed freedom of movement within the realm and freedom to depart the realm the above paragraph thus guarantees full freedom of movement for swedish citizens within sweden and across the swedish border under peacetime conditions the paragraph is not absolute there are exceptions for example for prisoners and conscripts for military service as stated in chapter 2 article 2021 in regeringsformen local restrictions on the movement of people can be adopted for health reasons however there is no exception for a contingency like a pandemic thus these rules cannot be adopted for a full nationwide lockdown similar to those put in place in other countries the regeringsform chapter 2 article 24 allows the government to restrict the freedom of meeting and of demonstration due to an “epidemic” freedom of assembly and freedom to demonstrate may be limited in the interests of preserving public order and public safety at a meeting or demonstration or with regard to the circulation of traffic these freedoms may otherwise be limited only with regard to the security of the realm or in order to combat an epidemic the freedom of assembly has also been restricted by a ban of all public meetings with more than fifty participants as part of the governments strategy to deal with covid19 the constitution guarantees the independence of public agencies public agencies are independent from the government in their daily business according to the constitution the tradition goes far back in history a first step was taken in the regeringsform of one thousand six hundred and thirtyfour designing the structure of public agencies after the death of king gustavus adolphus ii in the thirty years war while crown princess christina was coming of age a second step was the regeringsform of 1720 following the death of charles xii restricting the power of the king and establishing independent public agencies today the swedish system is based on administrative dualism where the public agencies are set up outside the ministries of the central government as stated by nergelius 2018 300 the independence of public agencies from the government “is unusual or even unique in an international perspective” as explained in the english introduction to the regeringsform the government has no powers to intervene in an agencys decisions in specific matters relating to the application of the law or the due exercise of its authority in many other countries it is common for an individual minister to have the power to intervene directly through a decision in an agencys daytoday operations this possibility does not exist in sweden however collective government decisionmaking and the ban on instructing agencies on individual matters are expressions of the prohibition of ministerial rule as it is often called this approach reflects the wording of the constitution in chapter 12 article two of the regeringsform no public authority including the riksdag or decisionmaking body of any local authority may determine how an administrative authority shall decide in a particular case relating to the exercise of public authority visàvis an individual or a local authority or relating to the application of law the constitution thus prevents interference by ministers of government in affairs that are assigned to various public authorities public agencies are given a status to some extent similar to the independence of the courts and of the riksbank the swedish central bank still the government appoints the heads of public agencies determines their budgets and the legislation relevant for their tasks the public health agency of sweden folkhälsomyndigheten is such a public authority now in charge of framing and designing the policy response to the pandemic it is run by experts in epidemiology not by political appointees the collaborative work of health economists and epidemiologists at the swedish public health agency has produced a response that considers the overall impact of its measures and recommendations to sum up the constitution insulates the public authorities from direct political meddling to a much greater degree than in any other democracy allowing experts to design the policy response although the government is not formally bound to follow the recommendations of public agencies by tradition this is the case the constitution guarantees selfgovernment at the local level in addition the swedish constitution gives a strong role to local selfgovernment this tradition goes back to the late middle ages the autonomy of the local authorities is anchored in chapter fourteen in regeringsformen on local authorities art 2 the local authorities are responsible for local and regional matters of public interest on the principle of local selfgovernment selfgovernment through the municipalities at the local level and the regions at the regional level actually covers the major share of the large swedish public sector including the healthcare sector and the care of the elderly thus the power of the central government in these healthrelated areas is limited by the independence of the local authorities this decentralised structure of two hundred and ninety municipalities and twentyone regions contributes to the exceptional swedish response to the pandemic as the swedish constitution prohibits the use of lockdowns and state of emergency as policy tools the government has to rely primarily on information and recommendations to influence the behaviour of the public the impact of this type of policy tools is closely related to the degree of trust in society the swedish public holds a strong trust in public institutions in government effectiveness and honesty in the accountability of elected politicians in the democratic process and in the rule of law this can be seen from the eurobarometer surveys covering all eu member states here the swedish respondents display a high trust in their national government while citizens in many eu member states hold considerably lower trust in their governments as demonstrated in figure 1 figure one average trust in the national government across the eu from november two thousand and thirteen to may two thousand and nineteen percentage of respondents who tend to trust the national government in the debate on the swedish exception a host of other factors have been suggested they emphasise for example the strong liberal tradition in swedish history or the long period of peace making i|2020-06-18|0.9985|positive|0.07556107417714558|positive

best buys former chairman and ceo reflects on a businesss reason for being by defining it around purpose and humanity the link to competitive advantage and managing shareholders and stakeholders during a crisis and beyond|in a recent poll of customers reaction to the covid19 crisis more than eighty percent of respondents said they would remember which companies “did the right thing by their workers” in dealing with safety measures or efforts to avoid layoffs threequarters said they wouldnt forget those businesses that took missteps “long after” the crisis ends this is familiar terrain for hubert joly after joining best buy as ceo in 2012 joly engineered a dramatic transformation of the ailing electronics retailer and built a reputation over time as one of the business worlds most visible advocates of defining a businesss reason for being with social purpose and people as a guiding star today as more and more executives grapple with the need to incorporate the needs of all stakeholders into their leadership choices jolys experience reflects the challenges and opportunities inherent in mobilizing customers vendors and other stakeholders in pursuit of what he calls “noble purpose” in this edited interview joly a mckinsey alumnus shares his thinking with mckinseys bruce simpson about personal purpose and managing the evolving landscape of corporate purpose during covid19 and beyond my individual personal purpose is to try to make a positive difference for people around me and then to use the platform i have to make a positive difference in the world this is an evergreen purpose meaning whether im the ceo of best buy or starting my next chapter its always true it stems from a reflection on what work is because of course work is a big part of our lives you can see work as a curse as a punishment because we sinned in paradise i tend to see work as being essential to our humanity and to our fulfillment part of our quest for meaning its not something you do so that you can do something else its something thats essential to our lives i think its essential when we lead companies that we recognize this for all of the people working at the company—and that we can connect their individual purpose with the purpose of the company these days most companies and most leaders believe in the importance of purpose and there is a broadbased realization that excessive focus on profits is wrong the question is often “so where do you start and how do you sequence” the logical part of our mind would have us start with purpose then derive the strategy anchor it in purpose and transform the organization on that basis my personal experience is different when we started the turnaround i was very clear about my philosophy which was that profit is not the purpose purpose is to contribute to the common good but we did not spend time in the first three years of the turnaround on refining our purpose we spent the time saving a ship that was sinking by addressing key operationalperformance drivers we also spent a lot of time—and i can see it very clearly with hindsight—on making sure that the soil of the company was fertile do you know the parable of the sower if the seeds fall on stones nothing is going to happen you may have perfect seeds but they arent going to grow so a lot of our emphasis was on creating a joyous growthoriented culture and on creating a very human environment where people felt that they belonged that it was a human organization that we emphasized individual development how do you define that noble purpose i believe you find it at the intersection of four circles what the world needs what you are good at how you believe you can make a positive difference in the world and how you can make money so the sequence of steps is not always going to be “start with purpose” a lot of companies are focused on that but it may not be the best point of attack when you start working on defining purpose the danger is to make it too abstract too glossy no it needs to be grounded in true customer needs and true demonstrated abilities to achieve competitive advantage your dream of course—but also the ability to make money something thats very real tangible and tightly connected to the growth and profit engine of the company the danger of the fact that purpose is very much en vogue paradoxically is to put too much emphasis too early on it—as opposed to really finding the right time and the right approach to go after it if the definition of purpose is too much for the website people say “well thats not my reality” so how do we make it real and how do we unleash that human potential at the end of the day a company is a human organization made of individuals working together in pursuit of a goal these individuals produce value for all stakeholders they are the source not simply a resource in a turnaround typically people tell you “cut cut cut” my approach to turnarounds is essentially the opposite its to start with people i spent my first week on the job in a handful of stores starting in the store in st cloud minnesota to listen to the front liners and learn from them what was happening thats how we decided to invest in the shopping experience online and in the speed of delivery to neutralize the advantage of online players we also invested in the store experience partnering with the worlds foremost tech companies to develop stores within our stores on the cost side we started by looking at how we could attack nonsalary expenses head count was a last resort—starting not with the front liners but with the top of the house in eight short weeks in 2012 we constructed a plan that we called “renew blue” we cocreated it we didnt go for perfection and then we got the bicycle going in a turnaround creating momentum and energy for a detailed look at best buys transformation listen to “transformation and resilience an interview with best buys executive chairman hubert joly” on apple podcasts when we presented our renew blue plan to our investors it had all of the stakeholders you have to engage as you lead these turnarounds customers employees vendor partners community and shareholders with the shareholders our approach was very simple we shared with them in november 2012 our diagnosis of our strengths and our opportunities we were very transparent we gave them the overall framework and our longterm targets i dont think you impress shareholders just by the words you use its more around the say–do ratio so in the following quarters we really focused on doing what we had said we were going to do on reporting quarterly progress on showing them concrete opportunities and on demonstrating how we had gone after them that allowed us to build credibility delivering quarterafterquarter progress was very helpful sometimes there is a debate as a company “do we need to focus on the short term or the long term and do shareholders force you to do crazy things because of a shortterm focus” i think thats a wrong an artificial debate im a big believer that ninetyeight percent of the questions that are asked as “eitheror” are better answered as “and” of course you need to focus on the long term and you need to focus on the short term ive also always found that if you tell the investors “look im going to be investing in this area and the payback is going to look like this” theyre very open to that they want you to create longterm value so if youre logical and you follow through with a track record of delivering results theyre very open to this any management team that relies on excuses related to shareholders is i think misdirected in the end it is about treating shareholders as customers these days most companies and most leaders believe in the importance of purpose and there is a broadbased realization that an excessive focus on profits is wrong its of course the easiest thing to measure there are generally accepted accounting principles gaap and at the end of each month you know what your profit is the problem is that if you focus too much on this outcome youre actually going to be tempted to do the wrong thing and by the way anybody who believes that your gaap numbers even your nongaap numbers are a good measure of the economic value creation for a business is wrong if you dig into it accounting has never really been designed as a way to represent economic value for example you always write down goodwill but you never write it up i think the key in leading companies is to have a balanced scorecard to have kpis key performance indicators that are focused on customers like a customersatisfaction score or revenue per customer on employee engagement and turnover on vendors and how the relationship with them is going your impact on and reputation in the community and on financial performance so its a matter of managing this holistically and i think as proxy advisers or rating firms work on measuring performance i am encouraged by the trend toward measuring an increasingly broad range of dimensions more can be done though in particular in the area of evaluating executive compensation proxy advisers focus their evaluation on total shareholder returns over one year three years five years that seems to indicate that profit is the only thing that matters there is increasing realization that having a purpose—a longterm strategy taking care of all of your stakeholders doing well by doing good—is the right approach so we have a bit of a lag here i think that over the next several years there will need to continue to be some work on that theres been some interesting work by the sasb sustainability accounting standards board and a few others were not there yet but i think we have to continue to move forward in that direction when we did market research we saw that although many of us love technology and there are a lot of exciting new products and things that we can do with technology its

digital ma is challenging—and often a necessity for digital transformation sophisticated acquirers boost their odds by addressing the pain points that undermine outperformance|the old saw that the best deals are the ones you dont make doesnt apply when it comes to digital acquisitions—youve got to make them our research has consistently shown you also need to do them well and that can be challenging because buying in the digital analytics and technology space—what we call “digital deals”—is different enough from undertaking conventional transactions to raise the odds of costly lapses in this article we show how to overcome those challenges and join the ranks of companies that have achieved exceptional performance by energizing their digitaltransformation efforts with successful mergers and acquisitions ma digital leaders pursue ma about twice as hard as everyone else they spend three times more on ma 27 percent of their annual revenues compared with nine percent by others and devote upward of 15 times more of their ma activity to the acquisition of digital capabilities and digital businesses 64 percent compared with thirtynine percent for their peers and ensure that software acquisitions are among their highest priorities and that was before the covid19 crisis which is making it even more important for many companies to rewire themselves in ways that sometimes necessitate acquiring digital capabilities highperforming acquirers approach ma in a programmatic way from strategy to deal execution and on through integration you can often spot their work by what they dont do make unforced errors at key points in the deal life cycle sometimes an acquiring company stumbles before it has even started not thinking through its strategy or what types of assets and capabilities it needs to acquire in other cases the acquirer doesnt sufficiently understand the technology its purchasing or how to value it and even when acquirers navigate the strategy and execution phases smoothly they can still wind up foundering during integration sophisticated acquirers know the common trouble spots three categories of challenges—across strategy execution and integration—are particularly worthy of attention in this article we address these challenges in turn so that when your organization moves forward with its digital deals as it must it can avoid common errors before they happen exhibit 1 tried trite but true luck really is the residue of design so too is the negative bad luck and poor outcomes follow illprepared—and sometimes downright absent—strategies dont expect that a deal done on a whim will turn out to be a winner an acquirer must rigorously consider what it hopes to accomplish why an acquisition aligns with its direction and what exactly it is buying be clear about the rationale as our colleagues have demonstrated fortune in the digital age favors organizations that have bold tightly integrated digital strategies to succeed digital reinvention must go beyond merely acquiring standalone products and services to bring to market an acquisition should follow your strategic plan so be clear about the strategic gaps you are trying to fill why do this deal is it for market leadership technical capabilities talent some combination of those objectives or perhaps for other strategic reasons just because a technology works or is on track to work doesnt mean its the right asset for your organization different assets in turn may look quite similar on their websites yet fulfill very different strategic needs and youre unlikely to recognize those disconnects if you havent been rigorous in spelling out the deals rationale articulate your strategy then identify your target its fine to make a tradeoff between commercial scale and cash flow on the one hand and more speculative though potentially pathbreaking innovation on the other so long as you know what you should be shopping for this is why acquirers that buy profitable mature assets and then expect gamechanging innovation can wind up feeling frustrated other times companies expecting immediate growth or earnings accretion are disappointed when they buy compelling intellectual property ip with little commercial traction sophisticated acquirers know the difference they make sure they are paying for what they need not for what they dont if a deal however attractive doesnt fill a demonstrated gap the acquirer is setting itself up for disappointment one technologyservices buyer for example wanted to beef up its devops portfolio and discovered a profitable software company that seemed to fit the bill but most of the targets revenues—and all of its profits—derived from a mature unrelated product with little strategic value to the acquirer the targets devops solution while capable turned out to be a niche product with limited market size and upside potential the acquirers strategic goal assumed by its senior leaders but not clearly spelled out to its businessdevelopment team was to achieve both innovation and scale this deal achieved only the first goal returns were compromised because the company hadnt pursued assets more in line with its strategy even if your strategy is clear it will be compromised if what you buy from a technical perspective turns out to be not what you thought you were buying the problem happens more than you may suspect in our experience technical due diligence is the single biggest differentiator of deals done well—or poorly whats more technical duediligence failures can usually be avoided almost always the disappointed acquirer insufficiently vets the technology and discovers too late that it fails to work as advertised or the technology does work but only in constrained environments and wont scale in other cases crucial parts of the ip turn out not to be owned by the seller some organizations do less technology due diligence on targets they plan to acquire for hundreds of millions of dollars than on companies they are evaluating say for an internal pilot program for a fraction of the price one reason is the necessary confidentiality associated with ma large marketmoving transactions require discretion—which can be problematic for digital deals if it inhibits leaders from bringing individuals with critical engineering knowhow into the information loop further complicating matters some organizations may not even have the inhouse capability to establish that the target can do what it purports to do seasoned acquirers always seek to evaluate the targets technology before a deal digital ma is a capability and bestinclass acquirers treat it that way with dedicated technology teams to stresstest prospective acquisitions its ideal to be a customer before you become an acquirer this element alone can dramatically reduce risk if thats not possible do whatever you can to become well versed in the technology before you buy it and understand how it will operate within your organization under realworld conditions digital deals arent plug and play a case in point one healthcareequipment manufacturer purchased an imagingtechnology company with sophisticated code that worked standalone but turned out to be incompatible with the technical architecture of the acquirers installed base the expensive mistake could have been avoided had the acquirer simply tried experimenting with the targets products in another case a communicationshardware manufacturer acquired a successful company that made remotenetworkmonitoring software it was a great product and a great fit but it had one great problem it relied on software code that was licensed but not owned by the acquired company soon after the acquisition the company that did own the code was itself acquired by one of the hardware companys competitors the code became unavailable as a result the hardware company had to redevelop the missing ip at a cost of tens of millions of dollars and a 24month delay an avoidable duediligence oversight doomed the investments returns getting the valuation wrong can of course doom returns as well sophisticated acquirers take care to understand value from a range of perspectives—not only from the perspective of the acquirer but also from that of the target and “the market” acquirers less familiar with digital ma may fail to value a digital asset properly that often stems from misconceptions about the value proposition consider the sources of value because ma in the digital analytics and technological space is so critical it is usually expensive “underpaying” is unrealistic bid too low and youll probably miss out but what does it mean to “overpay” consider one acquirer which well call company x at the time of an important deal this organization was numbered among the most valuable technology companies in the world it had experienced several years of impressive growth and its talented workforce had an enviable reputation as an innovation engine just as company x reached its highest valuation to date it acquired a new software platform for 50 million the platform had generated virtually no revenue when the deal closed but had the potential to complement the companys software offering and reach a new market of mobile users the platform produced no revenue over the year after the closing nor did it generate revenue the year after that or the following year as well— zero revenue not just zero earnings for three years did company x misunderstand the targets value proposition hardly company x was google now alphabet and the target was android today an immense platform that ships on over eighty percent of all new smartphones in two thousand and eighteen alone google made 25 billion enabled by androids massive installed base from google play value in the digital context is no different from value in other sectors—companies generate value when their return on invested capital exceeds their opportunity cost

it has played a bad hand badly|t a lot going on in britain in early march london staged an englandwales rugby match on march 7th which the prime minister attended along with a crowd of 81000 on march 11th liverpool played atletico madrid in front of a crowd of 52000 fans including 3000 from spain 252000 punters went to the cheltenham festival one of the countrys poshest steeplechase meetings which ended on march 13th as britons were getting together to amuse themselves and infect each other europe was shutting down borders were closing public gatherings being banned italy went into full lockdown on march 9th denmark on march 11th spain on march 14th and france on march 17th britain followed only on march 23rd putting in place sweeping restrictions on everyday life was a difficult decision fraught with uncertainty yet the delay is just one example of the governments tardiness britain has been slow to increase testing identify a contacttracing app stop visits to care homes ban big public events provide its health workers with personal protective equipment   and require people to wear face coverings on public transport as this wave of the disease ebbs britons are wondering how they came to have the highest overall death rate of any country in the rich world and why leaving lockdown is proving so difficult the evidence so far suggests that the british government played a bad hand badly the country was always going to struggle the virus took off in london an international hub britain has a high proportion of ethnicminority people who are especially vulnerable to the disease and britons are somewhat overweight which exacerbates the impact of the infection britain has got some things right its researchers have been in the forefront of the race to find drugs and create vaccines against the disease on june 16th a trial by oxford university the first to identify a lifesaving medicine showed that a cheap steroid can reduce mortality among the sickest patients by a third a swift reorganisation of the national health service put paid to fears that it would be overwhelmed but the government has wasted the most precious commodity in a crisis time in a federal system like americas the central governments failings can be mitigated by state and local authorities in a centralised system they cannot hindsight is a fine thing and offers a clarity that is absent in the blizzard of events yet it is now plain that britains scientists initially argued for the wrong approach accepting that the disease would spread through the population while protecting the vulnerable and the health service neil ferguson an epidemiologist at imperial college london estimates that had britain locked down a week earlier at least half of the 50000orso lives that have been lost would have been saved this is more britons than have died in any event since the second world war in retrospect the government should have probed the scientists advice more deeply some of it was questionable the received wisdom that people would tire of social distancing and that shutting down early would mean loosening early too was just a hunch even after the evidence changed and it became clear the country was heading for catastrophe the government was slow to impose the sort of lockdown seen across europe yet you do not need hindsight to identify other mistakes delays in fixing supply chains promoting face coverings and increasing testing capacity were clearly errors at the time despite the urging of the countrys scientists and the world health organisation by the middle of april britain was still carrying out just 12000 tests a day compared with 44000 in italy and 51000 in germany because most testing was reserved for hospitals care homes struggled to find out which of their residents and staff were infected competition for was fierce so they also struggled to get the kit they needed to protect their workers the government is not solely to blame the pandemic made new demands on the system some crucial bits of machinery did not work the publicly owned company which supplies the health service with failed public health england which was responsible for testing and tracing failed but there was a failure of leadership too when systems break it is the governments job to mend them when the evidence argues for drastic measures ministers need to take them britain is still living with the consequences the spread of the virus and the devastation it has wrought have made leaving lockdown difficult as shown by the halting return of pupils to school only five yeargroups have gone back many parents are choosing to keep their children at home and the government has abandoned an earlier ambition to get more in the “worldbeating” contacttracing system still lacks its app which is not due to arrive until winter slow progress at suppressing the virus will have grave economic consequences too these shortcomings have claimed many victims among them is public trust britain went into this crisis with a powerful sense of unity and goodwill towards the government now britons think worse of their governments performance during the crisis than do the citizens of any of twentytwo countries polled by yougov aside from mexico that reflects the governments mistakes and its hypocrisy after the prime ministers main adviser broke its own rules about when to travel—and kept his job while the world waits for a vaccine this lack of trust will make managing the disease a lot harder the painful conclusion is that britain has the wrong sort of government for a pandemic—and in boris johnson the wrong sort of prime minister elected in december with the slogan of “get brexit done” he did not pay covid19 enough attention ministers were chosen on ideological grounds talented candidates with the wrong views were left out in the cold mr johnson got the top job because he is a brilliant campaigner and a charismatic entertainer with whom the conservative party fell in love beating the coronavirus calls for attention to detail consistency and implementation but they are not his forte the pandemic has many lessons for the government which the inevitable public inquiry will surely clarify here is one for voters when choosing a person or party to vote for do not underestimate the importance of ordinary decent competence

resilience partly thanks to major reforms after the crisis of 20072009 the crisis will put them under stress moreover the traditional banking model was already being challenged precovid by three trends persistently low interest rates enhanced regulation and increased competition from shadow banks and digital entrants this column introduces the second report in the future of banking series from the iese business school and cepr which provides a perspective on how the current crisis and these trends will shape the future of the banking sector the world is witnessing a large and synchronised economic crisis forecasts for two thousand and twenty suggest a drop in global gdp of 6 with a record number of countries growing at negative rates oecd 2020 advanced economies will suffer a much larger drop in gdp of a size not seen since the great depression no doubt banks will come under stress as largescale insolvencies among firms will arise and a wave of bankruptcies among households may follow in addition while banks entered the crisis better capitalised and more liquid the size of the crisis will likely strain them to a degree exceeding that envisioned in many stress tests conducted so far ecb 2020 the crisis comes on top of the combination over the past decade of several trends that have meant increased competitive pressure on banks and that in particular in some regions have lowered their profitability in the second report in cepriese series on the future of banking claessens et al 2020 we argue that the global pandemic is likely to prolong if not accelerate many of these trends – digitalisation in particular while the economic crisis has triggered policy responses to stimulate lending to the real economy while assuring the stability of the banking sector that provides breathing space in the short run deep restructuring of many banking systems will be needed in the mediumterm download the bank business model in the postcovid19 world here we have now been living in a world of low interest rates and subdued growth rates for more than a decade these persistently low rates have negatively affected bank profitability through reduced net interest margins and weakened monitoring incentives and lending standards in particular for those institutions more reliant on maturity transformation and net interest income in the wake of the 20072009 financial crisis we also witnessed over this period an increase in prudential requirements regulatory scrutiny and compliance costs as analysed in the first report in this series bolton et al 2019 these policy steps have contributed to a more resilient banking sector which is very beneficial in the current context at the same time however the tighter rules have lessened banks competitiveness relative to shadow banks and added to a migration of some business activities away from the banking sector towards shadow banks moreover stricter regulation has put pressure on banks profitability the covid19 crisis most likely means interest rates will remain low for much longer although in the short run banks are bound to benefit from being the channel of liquidity support and having access to central bank support the deep crisis hitting the real economy is likely to bring a new surge in nonperforming loans and could threaten banks solvency once again an additional development during the precovid world was the massive application of digital technologies and the emergence of new competitors while these have allowed for many new products and services and helped improve the efficiency of incumbent banks they have also favoured the entry of new firms increasing competition with traditional bank business models the impact of technology on bank business models has been profound vives 2019 technological advances have affected payment systems capital markets activities credit extension and deposit collection in the report we analyse in detail the area where much activity is happening – namely digital money and payments for decades banks have controlled digital forms of money and payments through regulatory protection of deposits exclusive access to the central bank settlement system and close partnerships with credit card companies the challenge today comes from a variety of digital assets that do not sit on the balance sheet of banks cryptocurrencies electronic wallets stablecoins or balances with a telecom provider the competitive advantage of the new entrants is not based on the asset itself but on the payment technology associated with it the convenience of payments and the connections to other parts of the growing digital life of consumers and business alike accelerated by the covid crisis has been the key to success the dominance in payments of tech companies in china or mobile telecom providers in parts of africa are examples of the extent of disruption disruption from technology has happened in many other areas not just payments entry in the different financial service segments has come from new types of providers ‘fintech and ‘bigtech fintech providers of credit are more present when the countrys general development is higher and its banking system is less competitive but less so when the countrys regulation is stricter nonbank entry is not yet meaningful in demand depositlike taking activities possible due to concerns about regulatory burdens bigtech platforms with their advanced technology and especially their associated greater access to big data could make major inroads but have not done so to date the entry of new players greatly affects banks through downward pressures on fees and prices and more compressed margins banks have responded but many argue that they are far from adopting technology effectively themselves as a result their profitability comes further under threat the technological advances and new entry require regulatory responses the technologies used by the new entrants can create new risks including fresh consumer and investor protection issues as the accumulating evidence on risk of discrimination associated with greater use of technology and big data shows since more entities now provide financial services and in new forms it is also crucial to ensure a level playing field a related important question is where to draw the regulatory ‘perimeter given that the overall industrial organisation of the various financial services markets is changing the technologyinduced changes also call for reassessments of competition and data policies in the short run banks may enjoy a revitalisation as they continue lending to their customers during the crisis notably as soft information can more valuable today than hard information they also enjoy the protection of the safety net and access to deposit financing nevertheless covid19 will likely accelerate the digitalisation and the shift over the medium term of activities away from the sector mediumsized banks will likely be suffering the most since reaping cost efficiencies with large it investments crucial in a persistently low interest environment will be out of reach as a result the banking sector will need deep restructuring winding up banks and consolidating the remaining ones will be preferred whether in the postcovid19 world political obstacles to crossborder mergers will prevent as states become more protective of their national banking champions is a major policy question bigtech companies have many of the ingredients to get ahead in the postcovid world they are digital natives they have the technology customer base and brand recognition as well as vast amounts of data and deep pockets banking may thus move from the traditional oligopoly to a system with a few dominant platforms that control access to a fragmented customer base with a few bigtech firms together with some platformtransformed incumbents monopolising the interface with customers in this scenario ensuring customer data ownership and portability for individuals and data interoperability between platforms will be key to keeping switching costs for customers low and the market sufficiently competitive digital disruption poses a formidable challenge to regulators which must adapt by balancing facilitating competition and allowing the benefits of innovation to pervade the system with protecting financial stability in order to so regulators must coordinate prudential regulation and competition policy so that compliance does not becomes a barrier to entry while at the same time entry does not becomes destabilising competition can be fostered by light regulation of the entrants but at the potential cost of decreasing the profitability of incumbents and thus increasing their risktaking incentives in addition this may mean the generation of systemic risks to nonbank entities the current crisis will test the resilience of the financial system and the regulatory reforms implemented after the global financial crisis of 20072009 which were examined in the first report from the banking initiative in particular it will stretch the limits of central bank intervention and put to the test the

coalition parties they will each have to raise their game by a considerable measure to have any chance of surviving the inevitable storms ahead leo varadkar had the bonus of being able to bask in the spectacularly good approval ratings revealed in the latest irish timesipsos mrbi poll just as the coalition deal was being announced but that raises the question as to why fine gael did so badly in the general election “im pleased for leo that he is getting public recognition for his leadership in the covid crisis but im angry that he has only shown his true abilities after the horse has bolted” said one senior fine gael figure “he picked the wrong date for the election the preparations were appalling and the campaign was a disaster” by contrast his handling of the covid crisis was surefooted and might even be described as inspiring once the seriousness of the threat became apparent he took decisive action and more importantly communicated the scale of the threat to the public and generated a mood of solidarity that was vital to make the lockdown successful that mood was summed up in a childs poem about the lockdown read out on lyric fm a few weeks ago which contained the lines “and thank god we have leo not boris or trump” the question facing varadkar now is how back in government as tánaiste he will be able to contribute to a similar level of public support for the difficult process of exiting the lockdown and coping with the cost another if less important question is whether in his new role as tánaiste he will be able to sustain anything like the level of support shown for fine gael in the poll or whether in government the party will slide back to the dismal rating it achieved in the general election for micheál martin the conundrum is the opposite he will finally achieve his ambition of becoming taoiseach but at a time when his party is sinking in the polls and the man he is replacing has managed to generate a record level of public trust establishing his authority as taoiseach will be his first priority and that will not be easy given the scale of the task ahead martin will have to demonstrate leadership skills in office as that will be crucial to rebuilding the image of fianna fáil as a competent party of government maintaining a distinctive image will be a challenge but after nine years in opposition a spell in government offers the best opportunity to do that in the past fianna fáils great strength was its ability to bring people along with it while it was in government that gave it the platform to win reelection on a regular basis it is a political skill that always eluded fine gael and it will be a vital ingredient in making the threeparty coalition a success for eamon ryan the process of attempting to bring his party into government has been a daunting experience after the february election it was widely assumed that having led his party to a record twelve dáil seats he would be in a strong position to set its future direction instead as often happens in politics great success can be every bit as dangerous as failure for a leader ryan has had to move very carefully in an effort to bring most of his new tds with him along the path to government some of them are clearly not enamoured with his leadership and regard him as every much part of the establishment as fine gael and fianna fáil as if that wasnt enough he is also facing a leadership challenge from his deputy catherine martin and there is no guarantee that even if the members vote to go into coalition he will remain as leader all of that adds a huge element of instability to the potential government and ryan will have his work cut out to maintain control even if he survives the leadership challenge the ability of the coalition to govern effectively will depend on a high level of trust between the three party leaders if ryan is removed from the leadership it is difficult to see how cohesion will be maintained in the face of the difficult decisions ahead still the likelihood must be that if a majority of green party members endorse going into coalition they will stick by the leader who has brought them there as far as implementing a green agenda goes there was never a better time for the party to be in power they have extracted serious commitments from the other two parties on climate change while the current moves by the eu to implement a green deal mean that there is an effective guarantee they will get a lot of their priorities implemented as they weigh up their options green members could do worse than

response of the stock markets has raised concerns as well as questions this column explores the surprising trends there is some evidence that shareholders have favoured the less vulnerable firms and that credit facilities and government guarantees lower policy interest rates and lockdown measures mitigated the decline in stock prices however fundamentals only explain a small part of the stock market variations at the country level overall it is hard to deny that the links between stock prices and fundamentals have been loose at best on eight june 2020 the world health organization who announced that the covid19 pandemic was worsening around the globe and warned against complacency “most people globally are still susceptible to infection  more than six months into this pandemic this is not the time for any country to take its foot off the pedal” on the very same day the us stock market began its fourth consecutive week of rally the sp five hundred index is back to where it was at the beginning of 2020 erasing the historic plunge onethird of its value that took place between twenty february and twentythree march 2020 as if nothing had ever happened this is simply unprecedented as illustrated in the figure below figure one the us stock market in the time of covid19 note this figure compares the drop of the sp five hundred index during the dotcom crisis which peaked on march 24 2000 the subprime crisis peaked on oct 9 2007 and the covid19 crisis peaked on feb 19 2020 in march 2020 it took only one month for the sp five hundred to lose onethird of its value while it took one year for the subprime crisis to decline the same amount and one year and half for the dotcom bust authors computation is anything strange about the stock market behaviour in the time of covid19 as the world suffered from the worst economic crisis since the great depression baldwin and weder di mauro 2020a 2020b bénassyquéré and weder di mauro 2020 coibon et al 2020 the reaction of stock markets raises serious concerns since the beginning of the crisis stock prices seem to be running wild they first ignored the pandemic then panicked when europe became its epicentre now they are behaving as if the millions of people infected the 400000 deaths and the containment of half the worlds population will have no economic impact after all in one of his influential new york times columns paul krugman 2020 said out loud what many people were thinking “whenever you consider the economic implications of stock prices you want to remember three rules first the stock market is not the economy second the stock market is not the economy third the stock market is not the economy … the relationship between stock performance – largely driven by the oscillation between greed and fear – and real economic growth has always been somewhere between loose and nonexistent” the no less famous malkiel and shiller 2020 have also discussed the seemingly odd behaviour of stock markets in the face of the pandemic according to malkiel the alleged stock market irrationality is only “apparent” and the covid19 crisis does not “imply that markets are inefficient” inasmuch as there are no arbitrage opportunities and stock markets remain hard to beat shiller is more nuanced “speculative prices may indeed statistically resemble a random walk but they are not so tied to genuine information … the contagious stories about the coronavirus had their own internal dynamics only loosely related to the information about the actual truth” what new insights on stock markets behaviour can be drawn from the covid19 crisis this debate is of special importance for financial economists but also because the general public has a very negative view of the stock markets which should not leave us unconcerned rajan 2015 – all the more so since the covid19 crisis put science and ‘experts to the test aksoy et al 2020 without sparing economists there is a fastgrowing body of research looking at the responses of stock markets to the covid19 pandemic which is already giving some insights while the dynamic of stock markets during the pandemic might look random irrational or even insane at first glance on closer inspection they did not react blindly several studies have shown that stock markets were effective in discounting the most exposed companies those who were more financially fragile subject to the disruption of international value chains vulnerable in terms of corporate social responsibility or less resilient to social distancing alburque et al 2020 ding et al 2020 fahlenbrach et al 2020 pagano et al 2020 ramelli and wagner 2020 moreover it seems that stock market losses are related to analyst forecast revisions at least in the medium term landier and thesmar 2020 in relation to these papers we take a macroeconomic perspective indeed the abovementioned studies provide valuable information but some questions remain open how have stock markets reacted to the covid19 pandemic how do we explain differences in responses between countries are these differences in stock market response across countries related to macroeconomic or institutional characteristics and if so which ones are these differences due to the way governments have handled the pandemic how have stock markets have reacted to lockdowns and economic policies implemented countrywide to ‘flatten the curve of infection and the curve of recession gourinchas 2020 in our recent paper capelleblancard and desroziers 2020 we assess how stock markets have integrated public information about the covid19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns although the covid19 shock has been global not all countries have been impacted in the same way and they have not reacted in the same way we take advantage of this strong heterogeneity we aim to explain the difference in stock markets response by the situation in each country before the crisis as well as subsequent containment measures social distancing and stayathome orders and economic policies fiscal and monetary implemented during the crisis we consider a panel of seventyfour countries from january to april 2020 which might be divided into four phases incubation outbreak fear and rebound for each country we collected daily data about stock index prices the number of covid19 cumulative cases and deaths global market sentiment and volatility government measures taken in response to the outbreak and various indicators of mobility or lack thereof three main findings about stock market reactions during the covid19 pandemic arise first after initially ignoring the pandemic until twentyone february 2020 stock markets reacted strongly to the increase in the number of infected people in each country 23 february to twenty march 2020 while volatility surged as concerns about the pandemic grew however following the intervention of central banks 23 march to twenty april 2020 shareholders no longer seemed troubled by news of the health crisis and prices rebounded all around the world second countryspecific characteristics appear to have had at best little influence on stock market responses stock markets did not react more strongly in countries more susceptible to the pandemic either due to structural economic fragility for instance indebted countries or through exposure to transmission vectors for instance countries with ‘atrisk populations third investors were sensitive to the number of covid19 cases in neighbouring but mostly wealthy countries fourth credit facilities and government guarantees lower policy interest rates and lockdown measures mitigated the decline in stock prices in conclusion do stock markets incorporate all available information actually it transpires that we can see the glass as halffull or halfempty on the one hand the dynamic of stock markets during the covid19 pandemic is not completely accidental in particular our study suggests that it was not the situation of countries before the crisis that influenced the reaction of stock markets but rather the health policies implemented during the crisis to limit the transmission of the virus and the macroeconomic policies aiming to support companies on the other hand fundamentals only explain a very small part of the stock market variations just like krugman and shiller have claimed it is hard to deny that the link between stock prices and fundamentals have been anything other than loose aksoy c g b eichengren and o saka 2020 “revenge of the experts will covid19 renew or diminish public trust in education” lse systemic risk

they have an idea for a new experiment now says jeremy grabbe|my sevenyearold triplets — two girls and a boy — were having trouble doing classwork at home the coronavirus pandemic meant that they did not have access to a classroom with desks to sit down at it is hard to study at the diningroom table with your siblings their school sensibly tries to put them in separate classrooms so that they dont distract each other as dad gives the baby a bottle and emails his students this was something we all had to get used to a more upsetting issue was my childrens anxiety concerning the virus and social distancing this anxiety became clear when i returned from groceryshopping one day to find one of my daughters crying uncontrollably because she was afraid i would not make it back alive my other daughter had nightmares that my wife a healthcare worker would get covid19 and give it to the baby my son was afraid that we would run out of food and starve i was able to find a solution that helped with working and schooling from home taking a cue from a local science museums spacestation simulator we turned our guest bedroom into a spaceshipthemed classroom we decorated it to resemble the international space station and uss enterprise each child had their own computer station on the ‘bridge and i had a standing workstation we were able to embark on a learning experience using our imaginations however the triplets anxiety endured my son cried when after the closure of schools parks museums and the library he found out that the arcade at our local shopping mall was closed too i told my children that experts were telling everyone to engage in social distancing and i showed them the covid19 prevention guidelines issued by the chief medical officer of the us coast guard rear admiral dana thomas is a highly qualified physician and the consensus of the triplets was that we should therefore listen to her i told my children about a paper i had published about how expert opinion influences peoples attitudes towards climate change we decided that we would do our own study about who people trust for information about covid19 prevention although the study would be small rushed and nowhere near the quality threshold for peer review i saw it as an opportunity to teach my children about the scientific method and to address their coronavirus anxiety headon we devised an experiment in which people would hear messages from four sources about preventing the spread of covid19 we decided that the sources would be a group of healthcare workers the us centers for disease control and prevention social media and a fictitious politician for an educator such as myself explaining the experimental setup to sevenyearolds after years of teaching undergraduates was an eyeopening experience we collected data through an online survey when it came to data analysis i showed the triplets how the pictures used in their mathematics workbook from school are similar to charts and figures that are used in research this provided a breakthrough in their understanding of some mathematical concepts then we used the data to work on representing groups of numbers such as tens and ones to look at in our sample this helped my children to form a more concrete idea of large numbers and made working on mathematics with them more enjoyable and less of an arduous task my children were not fond of having to sit down and do writing assignments so i told them that even daddy has to do these i wrote up our results as a paper that conformed to american psychological association style and showed it to them this made the kids more open to working on writing tasks aside from the education they received at home my children now show less anxiety about covid19 but they are still sad at missing friends although social distancing and working from home can derail many plans it can also be an excellent opportunity to share your passion for science with your children turning my kids anxiety into curiosity was one of the most rewarding experiences i have had as a scientist during this difficult time we may have the opportunity to connect with our children in ways that inspire the next generation of scientists and my triplets already have an idea for our next experiment coronavirus and covid19 keep up to date|2020-06-19|0.9626|positive|0.061991213151927425|positive

speech by commissioner simson at the global hydrogen forum two thousand and twenty  20192024|ladies and gentlemen good afternoon its a pleasure to be speaking with you today let me start by saying that never before in europe have we seen such a level of interest about hydrogen as we have today the reason is twofold we need hydrogen to achieve climateneutrality and we should use this opportunity to invest in the clean energy technologies to restart the economy and promote innovation after the devastating economic effects of the covid crisis this new commission took office last december and since the beginning we have set our sights on a very clear goal – a climate neutral europe within thirty years this is the corner stone of our green deal strategy the first half of this year has definitely not gone to plan as we found ourselves combating the biggest health crisis in living memory still we are turning adversity into opportunity we have published a recovery plan for europe  the next generation eu  putting the green transformation at its heart in this way the green deal and the clean energy transition act as a new growth strategy one that creates new investments and jobs for our people one example is wind energy over the last decade the cost of electricity generated by offshore wind fell by almost 30 and it is becoming more and more competitive compared to fossil fuel sources our power sector is decarbonising rapidly and by two thousand and thirty almost 76 will come from lowcarbon sources renewables 548 and nuclear 211 by 2050 our electricity supply is expected to be fully decarbonised with over 80 coming from renewables but electricity alone cannot get us there we know that we will also need other carriers we also know that to keep energy costs in check we must harness all the synergies and exploit the complementarities between the electricity sector our vast gas infrastructure our industry and the transport sector hydrogen is a vital missing piece of the puzzle to help us reach this deeper decarbonisation and to reach it at a lower cost to people we have recognised this opportunity and are working on two key strategies to be launched on the 8th of july a strategy for energy system integration and a dedicated strategy on hydrogen they will set out how we intend to accelerate the transition to the energy system of the future a system in which hydrogen will play a key role today we use hydrogen mostly in chemical processes tomorrow hydrogen can decarbonise these industrial processes it can be a new fuel for heavyduty transport and clean jet fuel for aviation or replace coal in steelmaking to make this happen we need to focus our work in four areas first we need to activate a virtuous circle of increased supply and demand for hydrogen boosting demand in end uses like industrial applications and transport and investing in developing electrolysers with greater capacity part of this is bringing down the cost of clean hydrogen to make it competitive for this we need more and cheaper renewable energy and an efficient electricity market we have laid the ground for this through the clean energy for all europeans market design legislation which we are currently implementing but we will go even further to create an ecosystem approach to hydrogen production to do this we are creating a clean hydrogen alliance to bring the full value chain of hydrogen together investors governmental institutional and industrial partners this template of an industrial alliance has proven its worth before in europe we aim to involve all actors upstream and downstream to accelerate hydrogen deployment and achieve cost reductions and greater competitiveness second we need a regulatory framework to shape an open and competitive market with unhindered cross border trade and infrastructures to transport hydrogen where it is needed this could mean a need to repurpose or reuse some of our existing natural gas infrastructure and helps us to avoid stranded assets third we need to continue our research and innovation because developing a clean hydrogen economy poses a technological challenge we need to vastly scale up electrolyser technologies to support the ambition but at this point we still do not have the production capacity we need demonstration projects are starting at twenty mega watts in europe but we need giga watt scale electrolysers we also need research in fuel cells and storage so in september we will adopt a green deal call of nine hundred and fifty million eur under horizon 2020 which will also cover hydrogen of that more than one third will be dedicated to energy topics including a call for a largescale electrolyser it is our hope that these will help us to gather the right minds and unleash their research and innovation in all the relevant areas across the hydrogen value chain and finally we need international cooperation the eu imports today just over 58 of the energy it needs tomorrow we need to transform these imports of fossil fuels into clean energy partnerships we want to work with our neighbours in the first place but also with global partners we need common understanding and possibly even the harmonisation of codes and standards for trading hydrogen internationally i have seen our focus on hydrogen mirrored across the globe the number of countries joining the international hydrogen council has more than quadrupled in the past three years and directorgeneral matsuyama i have seen that japan has announced the next olympic games to be the “hydrogen olympics” this is excellent working side by side with our international partners is also a fundamental part of the research and innovation i mentioned earlier this is why we are taking part in all major initiatives related to hydrogen such as coleading the hydrogen initiative of the clean energy ministerial supported by the iea we are also involved in designing activities on hydrogen under mission innovation this is how we see the way forward – a strong approach on both an eu and an international level this is how we scale up exchange ideas and solidify the position of hydrogen in the energy sector i look forward to hearing your own views on hydrogens role in the energy system of tomorrow and more about where we can work together further to shape that future|2020-06-19|0.9995|positive|0.12853904693190404|positive

covid19 is an infection induced by the sarscov2 coronavirus and severe forms can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards requiring intensive care unit icu management severe forms are associated with coagulation changes mainly characterized …|objective no 1 to define the risk of thrombosis in patients with covid19 all covid19 patients should be screened for additional thromboembolic risk factors especially active cancer treatment within the last six months and recent personal history  one years of thromboembolic events other risk factors may be considered age  seventy years prolonged bed rest postpartum combined oral contraception to define the thrombotic risk level according to the following  the severity of covid19 according to the requirement of supplemental oxygen o  therapy highflow nasal oxygen therapy positive airway pressure support or mechanical ventilation then four different levels of thromboembolic risk can be determined low intermediate high and very high table 1 it is suggested that the following hemostasis variables be monitored at least every fortyeight h platelet count prothrombin time pt activated partial thromboplastin time aptt fibrinogen and ddimer levels in severe cases in the event of clinical worsening thrombocytopenia andor a decrease in fibrinogen concentration it is proposed that the concentration of fibrin monomers if assay available factors ii and v and antithrombin levels should also be measured for the diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation dic it is proposed that the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies should be investigated for iterative thrombosis under heparin therapy at effective doses in all hospitalized patients it is proposed to switch from oral anticoagulant therapy vitamin k antagonist or direct oral anticoagulant risk of instability and drug interactions to curative heparin therapy in case of intermediate thrombotic risk fig 1 it is proposed to prescribe prophylaxis with a lmwh at standard doses eg enoxaparin four thousand iu24 h sc tinzaparin three thousand five hundred iu24 h sc or dalteparin five thousand iu24 h sc fondaparinux 25 mg24 h sc is an alternative if creatinine clearance clcr is greater than fifty mlmin in the presence of severe renal failure an alternative to sc unfractionated heparin ufh can be proposed enoxaparin two thousand iu24 h sc for a clcr between fifteen and thirty mlmin or tinzaparin three thousand five hundred iu24 h sc for a clcr between twenty and thirty mlmin in patients treated with lmwh with standard prophylactic doses it is recommended not to monitor antixa activity in case of high thrombotic risk it is proposed to prescribe an adjusted prophylaxis with intermediate doses of lmwh enoxaparin four thousand iu12 h sc or six thousand iu12 h sc if weight  one hundred and twenty kg in case of renal insufficiency clcr  thirty mlmin it is proposed to prescribe ufh at an initial dose of two hundred iukg24 h iv in patients treated with lmwh doses higher than the standard prophylactic regimen it is proposed to check antixa activity four h after the 3rd injection then regularly in case of renal insufficiency to monitor for levels variable threshold value according to lmwh due to the potential increased risk of bleeding in case of very high thrombotic risk it is proposed to prescribe therapeutic doses of lmwh eg enoxaparin one hundred iukg12 h sc or in case of severe renal insufficiency of ufh five hundred iukg24 h iv after a bolus of five thousand iu and with dosage adjustment according to antixa activity in obese patients bmi  thirty kgm2 with a high or very high thrombotic risk the following heparin doses are proposed • none enoxaparin four thousand iu12 h or six thousand iu12 h if weight  one hundred and twenty kg in highrisk patients • none enoxaparin one hundred iukg actual weight12 h sc not to exceed 10000 iu12 h or ufh five hundred iukg24 h in very highrisk patients with additional thrombotic risk factor and highflow nasal o therapy or artificial ventilation in all patients treated with ufh it is proposed to monitor the antixa activity at least every fortyeight h and after each dose modification to be maintained if the risk of bleeding is controlled between 03 and 05 iuml during reinforced prophylactic treatment starting dose two hundred iukg24 h iv and between 05 and 07 iuml during therapeutic treatment starting dose five hundred iukg24 h iv after an initial iv bolus of five thousand iu the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo exposes the patient to a very high risk of thrombosis in this setting we propose therapeutic anticoagulation with ufh as soon as ecmo is initiated independently of the ecmo flow rate with a target antixa level between 05 and 07 iuml in case of an increased inflammatory syndrome eg fibrinogen  eight gl or eight hundred mgdl andor a rapid increase in ddimer concentration to  three μgml 3000 ngml it is suggested that the administration of therapeutic doses of heparin be considered even in the absence of clinical thrombosis taking into account the risk of hemorrhage for ufh it is recommended that platelet count should be monitored at least every fortyeight h a decrease in the platelet count by more than 40 between the 4th and 14th day of treatment requires a dic assessment and a screening for heparininduced thrombocytopenia in the event of multiorgan failure or a consumptive coagulopathy with decrease in fibrinogen concentration platelet count and factor v level it is proposed that the dosage of heparin therapy be reassessed as these events are associated with an increased risk of bleeding it is proposed that the intensity and duration of thromboprophylaxis be reevaluated according to the severity of the infection and the evolution of the resulting risk factors objective no 4 apply additional measures for optimal management of thrombotic risk discontinuation of hormonal or hormonerelated therapy estrogenprogestin contraception hormone replacement therapy tamoxifen is recommended in patients with covid19 requiring thromboprophylaxis it is proposed to implement a specific communication pathway between the clinical units and the hemostasis laboratory for optimal transmission of biological results in particular platelet count fibrinogen ddimer and antixa activity for rapid adaptation of heparin therapy it is suggested that pulmonary embolism be investigated in any patient with sudden respiratory or hemodynamic deterioration especially in the case of right ventricular dysfunction a proximal vein compression ultrasonography with doppler of the common femoral and popliteal veins is proposed in the event of any unexplained clinical worsening or in the case of a sudden increase in ddimer levels this examination may also be performed earlier in patients with a central venous catheter especially in case of dysfunction or obstruction the insertion of a vena cava filter is not warranted in these patients at low risk for bleeding intermittent pneumatic compression is an option to be considered if available in patients at a high risk of bleeding|2020-06-19|-0.9872|negative|0.03208312386538192|positive

premiership final is scheduled for june 26 just seven days before the lions first fixture against the western stormers in cape town chiefs coach gatland who will take charge of his third lions tour has revealed that a similar lack of preparation time ahead of the tour to new zealand in two thousand and seventeen led to him raising concerns with the management about the risk of legal action if a player was injured as a consequence with talks continuing between the unions and clubs over proposals to restructure the global season which could mean the lions tour switching from july to september and club rugby played through the summer months gatland insisted all parties had a duty to deliver on a commitment to improve player welfare read more  warren gatland reveals lions could face new zealand māori before south africa tour  warren gatlands plea to english clubs after horrendous preparation with lions in nz  warren gatland 100 per cent rules out replacing eddie jones as england coach  warren gatland appointed british and irish lions head coach for south africa in two thousand and twentyone it has been a little bit frustrating with the premiership not moving their final gatland said that may change with the reintroduction of the season we will have to wait and see the ideal situation would have been to have a full week together in the uk play a warmup game and get on the plane the following day and head to south africa i dont think assembling a squad for two weeks before you play your first game in south africa is too much of an unreasonable request last time in new zealand we left on the monday had two days travel and arrived on the wednesday the players were jetlagged and had to play the first game on the saturday i did point that out to the powersthatbe and the lions and said we were potentially opening ourselves up to legal action i said if a player got a careerending injury in the first game i think he had potentially got a legitimate claim to say that the preparation wasnt adequate or he didnt have enough time from arriving in new zealand before he was made to play his first game those are things we have got to be careful about everyone talks about player welfare and it is one of the criteria in looking at seasons and planning and preparation we have got to deliver that gatland is urging the premiership to reconsider and bring its final forward by a week as the pro14 has already committed to and insists the clubs would benefit directly from giving the lions the best chance of success the pro14 did it and i wasnt quite sure why the premiership werent prepared to do the same he added i am not sure why there doesnt seem to be the appetite to be really positive and try to work together in terms of helping the lions if the players go away on the lions and win a series it creates so much interest from new supporters who probably dont follow clubs you have got this potential to create superstars as household names and legends to me if that happens to a club you can use that and promote that and it benefits everyone i would like to see a little bit more cooperation but that is something we are continually battling with and i will keep banging away gatland insists the lions too are prepared to be flexible on the scheduling of their tour if switching it to a september start is key to reaching agreement on the global calendar talks which centre on moving the july test window to october probably the ideal scenario for us is that we would like to stay in the timeframe where it is at the moment but if it means having to move because it is a positive for everyone i think we are prepared to do that gatland added there is no doubt the southern hemisphere recognises how important the lions tour is to their calendar every four years it creates a lot of stimulus financially not only for the home unions but also the host country and creates a huge amount of interest from the fans the uncertainty in the scheduling is proving a challenge in his plans for the tour a recce trip to south africa next month has been postponed while recruitment of his backroom staff and coaching team has been put on hold because of the covid19 lockdown as head coach of the chiefs gatland is due to return to the uk at the end of august following the end of the super rugby campaign he says he intends to speak to the chief executives of the four home unions ahead of appointing his staff to ensure that there is no repeat of his frustrations four years ago when several candidates became unavailable including the current scotland head coach gregor townsend i have some approaches from individuals and from agents about people as i did last time he added i was interested in a few people had spoken to one or two and then for whatever reason people then became unavailable it was a bit frustrating the important thing now is that i have changed the process i want to get around all the chief executives of the four home unions and talk to them i will ask which of their staff are potentially not available so that we dont end up with that same situation going forward i have found working with the lions incredibly stimulating and there is no doubt that i think that all the four nations have benefited incredibly from the tours everyone takes the best out of the tour back to their home nation and club and implements the things that have been successful as a player or coach having first worked as an assistant coach under sir ian mcgeechan on the tour of south africa in 2009 gatlands passion for the lions is a central theme of his autobiography pride and passion which has been shortlisted for the rugby book of the year at the telegraph sports book awards having guided the tourists to victory in australia in 2013 and a historic drawn series against new zealand four years later gatland has already secured his place in lions folklore next year offers him the chance to complete what is likely to be his last tour in charge unbeaten against the southern hemisphere big three the dream is to be undefeated in the test series in three tours as head coach he added going forward it is probably an opportunity for someone else to step up and take the mantle if i can be of any service in terms of helping the lions in terms of sharing experiences i would love to follow them again i still have a huge passion for it and am very fortunate for my experiences i have had i have done my time but it is like anything they might come and knock on my door and say we dont think anyone else has got the experience and would you do it again then you reassess everything but they would probably say i have been in charge for three tours is it right for someone else to have a go i am comfortable with that|2020-06-19|0.999|positive|0.12678450054618282|positive
im fighting for my future im fighting for my safety im fighting for the people who come after me there were bathrooms in the building but the protesters werent allowed to use them…|there were bathrooms in the building but the protesters werent allowed to use them and if anyone left the police headquarters the officers wouldnt let them back inside but shortly before eight pm nearly five hours into what would be a 19hour occupation of the university of chicago police department a protester who was stretching accidentally pushed the metallic handicap button inside the building the door which was supposed to be locked swung open the forty masked protesters inside the lobby of the police headquarters texted some of the more than one hundred gathered outside about what they needed delivered diapers then during a break from the impromptu dance parties outside the doors protesters pressed the button popped open the door and threw the baby diapers one by one over an officers head and then under his legs the protestors had a new concern if they relieved themselves in the diapers—which for obvious reasons didnt exactly fit—would they be liable for public indecency but after a comforting phone call with the national lawyers guild it was deemed safe to use the diapers while in a tent on the far side of the lobby care not cops organized the june twelve protest and sitin along with uchicago united students working against prisons and uchicago student action as protests ripped across the nation after the police murder of george floyd care not cops issued a statement saying that university of chicago administrators have made both verbal and written statements claiming solidarity with protestors and a commitment to antiracist action in light of these we call with renewed vigor on the university to defund and disband ucpd as well as to make reparations to those victimized by ucpd the protesters had a list of demands defund the ucpd by fifty percent for the next school year and invest that money in grassroots organizations on the south side completely disarm the ucpd—including tasers and mace—and restrict the use of force disclose the ucpd budget for the last twenty years and commit to a plan to disband the ucpd by 2022 the protestors called for university of chicago provost ka yee lee and chief of ucpd kenton rainey to meet with them that night care not cops was born two years ago after the ucpd police shooting of thensenior charles soji thomas who was suffering a mental health episode the shooting and thomass subsequent eight felony charges including those of aggravated assault of an officer and damage to public property catalyzed student organizers to take action the desire to access information applies not just to the budget but also to policing policies this effort is not only driven by students but by community members in the neighborhoods surrounding the university that are disproportionately policed by both the cpd and ucpd chicagos largest private police force the freedom of information act which allows the public to access records does not apply to private institutions like the university of chicago two months after the shooting protesters organized an occupation of the campuss main quadrangle and demanded the administration meet to discuss disarming and defunding the ucpd the meeting however fell short of the organizers desires its actually ridiculous said tai davidson bajandas a rising fourthyear who helped found care not cops in 2018 because one of the things that they have told us the administration and something that the police chief told us was to organize if we want to see change when the protesters mostly in their 20s first occupied the lobby in the headquarters at 330 pm the side doors of the building remained open allowing them to move in and out of the building as they pleased the plan was to do this for the duration of the occupation to decrease the risk of covid19 the protestors sat on the ground while marshals from the march stood as if on guard in neon vests in the first few hours they created posters and drawings which read all black lives matter no justice no peace abolish ucpd by the morning the glass windows walls and doors of the headquarters were plastered in posters when business hours ended at five pm without warning ucpd cops locked the entrance the officers told protesters that no one would be permitted to enter the building and if anyone left they could not return the officers also said protesters would not have access to the buildings bathrooms and that no one was allowed in to supply them with additional food or water the pizzas that were ordered couldnt be delivered anna attie a recent graduate from uchicago where she has been organizing with uchicago student action another student organization that often partners with care not cops was the police and dean liaison of the protest she was standing in the doorway listening to an open mike where protesters were sharing poetry and words of affirmation when the police pushed her aside and locked the premises dean lynda daher who was on call that night arrived soon after the police locked the doors she said were here to protect your right to protest attie told me i obviously knew thats not really why she was there she was the only one that could really infringe on that right daher requested to go inside but after the officers refused she soon left meanwhile the scene directly outside headquarters was pleasant protesters played music laughed and danced some remarked that the occupation was an adequate replacement for the prepandemic dance parties they enjoyed with friends even rain showers didnt dampen the energy that coursed through the crowd officers soon cut the air conditioning in the building to sustain the occupation overnight the protestors split into groups when decisions had to be made representatives from each group met in the back of the lobby and while these meetings took place the other protestors blasted music from a portable bluetooth speaker danced and chanted to distract the police in the room in the hours leading up to three am the protesters made the space their own as rumors swirled about the chicago police department coming to disrupt the protest they created barricades out of dumpsters cars bikes and at times people cpd never came they pitched tents and wrote messages on the ground that read fuck 12 and autonomous zone many of the protesters i spoke to described the space as liberating to be able to just inhabit a space that felt so concrete so like autonomous    it was beautiful davidson bajandas said these were young people fighting for something and thats what im doing im a young person and im fighting for something im fighting for my future im fighting for my safety im fighting for the people who come after me safety yasin muhammad a 20yearold photographer and activist from south shore who spent the night inside the headquarters told me later some people in the neighborhood dropped off coffee tents and blankets but time moved strangely inside the headquarters i keep forgetting when things happened said attie it was so hectic and sort of felt like everything was happening at once i would sort of look up and realize hours had passed time was weird in there and time was likely weird because the police wouldnt let the protesters sleep every hour or thirty minutes a ucpd officer would come in and read kind of like the same memo said organizer and recent uchicago graduate michelle yang we were kinda confused about it but i think in retrospect we realized that because they did that continuously throughout the entire night that this was a way to drain us and prevent us from resting the chicago maroon reported that as students grew increasingly frustrated at being repeatedly woken or prevented from falling asleep they began chanting over the officer yelling quit your job or reciting lyrics from nicki minajs super bass ucpd later emailed the memo that was read inside the building you are in is now closed and you are trespassing you need to leave the building no one has or is preventing you from leaving the building the city and states covid19 guidance prohibits gathering of more than ten people you are required to wear masks and social distance with at least six feet between people we have made masks available to any of you who need one the dean on call has offered to arrange a meeting with the provost and the chief of police please refrain from calling the ucpd dispatch repeatedly and asking others to do so it is causing a public safety hazard while not sleeping the protesters spent the night expanding their art collection illustrations of batman slapping a pig dressed like a cop mario and waluigi next to a sign that read acab or all cops are bastards sailor moon saying in the name of the moon fuck the police this artwork only further reminded those who passed the headquarters of what ignited the protest one two three four five six seven eight nine ten 11 fuck 12 the protesters chanted into the night and at the police officers inside shortly after nine am after hours and hours of calls and emails from protestors and supporters during the occupation chief of police rainey spoke to those inside headquarters then addressed those outside rainey emphasized his support of the right to protest but also mentioned his concern for safety in the midst of the pandemic he said this while wearing a mask but with his nose exposed i appreciate what you guys are doing i really really do rainey said because im a black man black lives do matter ive lived this its not a slogan for me ive lived this every day of my life raineys confident air disappeared as the protesters questioned why he wouldnt meet with them now were not gonna have that discussion here he said ive given the people in there the date and time im

capabilities development command ccdc chemical biological center has been identified by the defense threat reduction agency dtra as an effective covid19 disinfectant center researchers have been working with atomes fd a company located in quebec city canada for more than two years the center provided testing and quality assurance to determine the general chemical and biological disinfecting effectiveness of their product bioxy after conducting a literature review to examine disinfection options against covid19 dtra identified bioxy for use as an effective inthefield disinfectant against covid19 and other viruses according to vipin rastogi phd a senior research biologist at the center rastogi and his group have been testing the effectiveness of bioxy since the beginning of the centers relationship with the company which led to the dtrafunded literature review “originally the company had no idea whether it would be effective against chemical or biological agents they were marketing it as a sanitizer and disinfectant for medical and veterinary clinics” he said “our work with the company was a partnership in which we performed detailed effectiveness testing against chemical and biological agents we were able to provide atomes with very specific advice on how to fine tune the product so that it could provide optimal protection to warfighters and the public against a broad range biological agents spores and viruses” the center research group led by rastogi determined that bioxy works well against a wide range of chemical and biological agents as well as the family of viruses which includes the pox virus feline calici virus and the ebola virus his team performed its testing using the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd guidelines for the testing of chemicals it is an international regulatory method for determining the efficacy of antimicrobial chemicals against spores cells and viruses the method is used by the thirtyseven oecd member nations as well as the us environmental protection agency much of industry and many independent laboratories “we place ten microliters of live agent on a glass or steel test surface called a coupon dry the agent for fortyfive to sixty minutes place fifty microliters of bioxy solution on top of that then after a 10minute contact period add a neutralizer to inactivate the active components of test solution in a vial” rastogi explained “the vial contents are vigorously mixed to retrieve the viable virus particles remaining off the test surface we then perform a count of the viable organisms remaining” the effectiveness of the disinfectant is determined by the percentage of change in the number of viable organisms in control coupons compared to those remaining on test coupons chlorine bleach has long been known to be an extremely effective disinfectant but it is highly corrosive making it unsuited for disinfecting the sensitive electronic equipment found in military vehicles peroxidebased disinfectants such as bioxy achieve a high level of effectiveness without being caustic “the active ingredients in bioxy break the molecular bonds in the virus” said rastogi “chemical bonds underlying the lipid virus envelope are what give the virus particle its structural integrity so breaking them renders the virus particle nonfunctional the active components may also destroy or break down bonds within the dna or rna that enables it to reproduce” “both variants of bioxy tested bioxy h and bioxy enviro provide many practical advantages to its military users because they are powders and not liquids” rastogi said “bioxy marketed as a powder has three advantages its not corrosive you can ship it without any fire hazard precautions and when you need it you mix it with water and you have a readymade decontaminant” it works by generating peroxide when mixed with water while bioxy still requires water to activate the peroxide the amount of water needed is far less than the hundreds of gallons typically used by decontamination trucks “we conducted a limited scale study where we tested a five percent solution” rastogi said “if you want to translate that to ratios five percent means five parts powder ninetyfive parts water but if that much water is not available you could make a ten to twentyfive percent solution” using bioxy at these higher concentration decontaminates the biological agent with no adverse effects on the soldier “it is safe for the skin and is biodegradable” rastogi said “it decomposes to innocuous end products oxygen and water” it is also inexpensive and commercially available for application to warfighters personal protective equipment vehicles and any other potentially contaminated materials in the field with far less logistical burden than hauling large quantities of waterbased decontaminants the relationship between the ccdc chemical biological center and atomes fd is the product of the foreign technology and science assessment support program known as ftas which is funded by the office of the secretary of defense it provides seed funding for scientists to perform initial research technology assessments and test and evaluation studies on promising defense technologies developed in other nations participating us army organizations such as the center select foreign technology initiatives on a competitive basis army researchers seeking an ftas grant submit a proposal which is evaluated by a panel of army experts and winning applicants are funded for one year to provide proof their technologys effectiveness in meeting an army need “had we not formed this relationship with atomes dtra would have never known about bioxy and what a valuable broad spectrum disinfectant it is for biological agents” said rastogi “it is very satisfying to know that because of this work the warfighter and the public have an inexpensive noncorrosive environmentally safe and highly effective technology in hand” “the centers use of the ftas program to contribute to the development of a new technology as useful as bioxy is a prime example of innovation in action” said eric moore phd director of the chemical biological center “good ideas are where you find them and we are glad we pursued this one – doubly so because it turns out that it is proving itself to be an answer to a brand new threat” dtra is now funding rastogi and his team to test the effectiveness of a number of other commercially available disinfectants to destroy the covid19 coronavirus using the oecd method this entry was posted on

evolved over the past decades this column presents evidence on services trade policies from a new database created by the world bank and wto it reveals that higher income economies are more open on average than developing economies but the chronology of reform varies across sectors in addition while explicit restrictions are being lowered regulatory scrutiny is increasing in most sectors especially in higher income economies economic policy has changed dramatically since the great recession the postwwii liberalising trend in goods trade is being reversed and multilateral cooperation is ceding ground to a more nationalistic view of policy world bank 2020 at the same time technological change is accelerating especially in response to the covid19 shock in this changing environment it has been possible to closely track goods trade policies but there is much less information on how services policies have evolved despite the growing importance of services in output and trade wto 2019 this gap in information matters because services are intimately linked to developments over the last decade for instance the great recession originated in financial markets where regulation failed to keep step with liberalisation rajan 2010 the emergence of new digital platforms is transforming business retail communication transport and financial services and the improvements in information and communication technology could be ushering in a new era of crossborder trade in services baldwin 2019 are governments reacting to these developments proactively through radical reform defensively by imposing new restrictions or inertially by doing nothing to answer this question and to facilitate the empirical analysis of policy change the world bank and the wto engaged in a major policy data collection and quantification exercise which resulted in a new world bankwto services trade policy database stpd this database contains information on the services trade policies in five broad areas – financial telecommunication distribution transportation and professional services the stpd contains information not just on core trade policies but also on other increasingly relevant regulatory measures such as licensing conditions and restrictions on crossborder data flows policy restrictiveness is quantified following an improved services trade restrictions index stri that aggregates the qualitative information within a single consistent and transparent measure data previously collected by the world bank over 20082011 were adjusted to the new classification and quantified based on the updated stri methodology the harmonised data make it possible for the first time to compare services trade policies over a long period of time – between two thousand and eight and two thousand and sixteen – for a large crosssection of fiftyfive advanced and developing economies on the basis of that information it is possible to identify patterns of services trade policies across economies and sectors as well as secular trends in policy making over the past decade on the face of it services trade regimes are generally becoming more open at least as far as explicit restrictions are concerned in apparent contrast to recent changes in goods trade policy most recently however services trade policy is also becoming more restrictive especially in digitally traded computer and audiovisual services oecd 2020 tightening measures in two thousand and nineteen mostly affected foreign investment and the movement of people this most recent turn of events notwithstanding higher income economies are still more open on average than lower income economies in most sectors the decrease in policy restrictiveness since 2008 ie over nearly a decade is slightly more pronounced for highincome economies figure 1 at the same time some dynamic developing economies such as bangladesh india and china have also liberalised significantly in the past decade other lowerincome and middleincome economies that have liberalised their services trade policies appreciably by at least five points on average are ecuador uruguay indonesia tunisia thailand colombia costa rica and pakistan underlying these patterns of overall liberalisation across economies are differences in the sectoral pattern of liberalisation we illustrate these below by focusing on two sectors financial services especially commercial banking and professional services auditing figure one services trade policy has become more open since the great recession changes in stri between 20082011 and two thousand and sixteen by level of income all sectors have been liberalized but by varying degrees broad waves in services policy reform can be identified higher income economies have led the way pioneering the opening up of telecommunications and finance to foreign competition in the 1980s and 1990s hence the picture already emerging a decade ago in these two sectors was of general openness in higher income economies and of varying degrees of liberalisation in developing economies the new database reveals that since two thousand and eight developing economies have started to reform those sectors that were first liberalised by higher income economies while the latter have embarked on the liberalisation of other sectors notably professional and transport services hence the picture emerging more recently is of policy convergence in telecommunications and finance driven by liberalisation by hitherto more restrictive developing economies and divergence and dispersion in sectors such as professional and transport services there are particularly striking examples of recent reforms in financial services in some of the most dynamic developing countries such as bangladesh kenya the philippines or vietnam figure 2 figure two limited convergence in financial services trade openness changes in stri between 20082011 and two thousand and sixteen by level of income digging deeper into the policy data on commercial banking services reveals certain patterns a large majority of economies now allow entry into their markets through the acquisition and control of domestic entities through the establishment of wholly owned subsidiaries or through direct branching the preferred avenue is the acquisition of already licensed institutions which may be explained by the host regulators wish to recapitalise local banks notably after the 20082009 financial crisis while maintaining the existing market structure and therefore the current intensity of competition both fully owned subsidiaries and direct branches have been increasingly allowed in most economies but the former remains a preferred option for local regulators given the potential for risk transmission that foreign bank branches present as was evident in the financial crisis interestingly no economy in our sample abrogated access through branching – the increased share of governments allowing this form of entry is the result therefore of additional liberalisation in emerging economies eg colombia egypt indonesia philippines russian federation even though there are now fewer explicit restrictions on entry scrutiny of foreign banks has remained intense or even been strengthened for instance even when the presence through branching is allowed stringent regulatory conditions eg imposition of endowment capital requirements limitations on the expansion of the branching network are imposed in a majority of economies in addition roughly a quarter of our sample now applies different licensing criteria for foreign banks finally more than half of the economies in our sample subject foreign banks to either economic needs tests investment screening requirements or nonautomatic licensing approvals even when all formal licensing criteria have been fulfilled figure three divergence in auditing services trade openness changes in stri between 20082011 and two thousand and sixteen by level of income policy dispersion is still the norm in sectors that joined the liberalisation wave more recently and in a more limited number of economies in auditing most of the decrease in the stri is linked to less restrictive policies regarding the entry of professionals in highincome and middleincome economies as well as the loosening of restrictions for crossborder supply for highincome economies restrictions on commercial presence were reduced only slightly with highly restrictive economies remaining so in two thousand and sixteen india korea panama the philippines turkey the highincome economies presenting the biggest reductions in restrictiveness are japan and some eu members where reforms in the auditing subsector came into force in june two thousand and sixteen in the aftermath of the financial crisis one of the aims was to improve auditing quality and to introduce rotation of auditors because of the concentration of the market one of the tools envisaged in that regard was to facilitate crossborder provision of statutory audit services focusing more specifically on the temporary movement of natural persons supplying services restrictions have decreased since 20082011 in european economies and in some other highincome countries eg canada japan us this was accomplished either by relaxing some of the economywide restrictions on the movement of persons quantitative limitations the lifting of nationality or residency requirements to obtain a license to practice or the recognition of foreign qualifications to conclude the last decade has seen steady and widespread liberalisation but with a twist while markets in services eg finance and telecommunications are increasingly free from explicit restrictions on entry and ownership they are increasingly subject to greater regulatory scrutiny eg economic needs tests fdi screening especially in higher income economies this raises several|2020-06-20|0.993|positive|0.11200672821154746|positive

amongst the worst affected women are vulnerable not only because of their jobs but also because of gender inequalities within housework division education and health there is an urgent need to support women repair gender disparities aggravated by crisis and to reduce womens vulnerability going forward genderresponsive fiscal measures are viable tools that work in the interests of women as well as supporting economic growth and reducing poverty and inequality the covid19 pandemic has killed more than 400000 people worldwide and has generated a massive global economic crisis the world economy is projected to contract sharply by 3 in two thousand and twenty imf 2020 and poverty is set to rise for the first time since 1998 bringing 4060 million people into extreme poverty world bank 2020 however unlike previous economic crises this crisis will negatively affect women more than men creating a significant blow for gender equality policymakers should step up their efforts to reestablish the path towards a more equal society for men and women a huge setback in the quest for gender equality gender inequality had diminished over the past thirty years for instance the gap between male and female labour force participation decreased by eight percentage points due to the large gains in female labour force participation especially within advanced economies figure 1 educational attainment gaps also narrowed around the world with thirtyfive countries having achieved full parity and one hundred and twenty countries closing at least 95 of their educational gender gaps wef 2020 the maternal mortality ratio had dropped by about 38 worldwide this encouraging progress however is likely to suffer huge setbacks during the covid19 crisis there are various reasons why the current crisis disproportionally impacts women first women are more likely than men to work in social sectors such as hospitality retail restaurants and tourism which require facetoface interactions figure 2 these are the sectors that are being hit the hardest by social distancing hupkau and petrongolo 2020 for example in the us almost 74 of women work in social sectors compared to 48 of men in 2019 further data for the first four months of the year indicate that employment in these sectors shrank by 18 compared to 10 in other sectors shibata 2020 in developing countries women are also more likely to be employed in social sectors than men notwithstanding an even bigger concern in many of these countries is that women often work in the informal sector more frequently than men and therefore have less job security and social protection as well as lower pay ilo 2018 second women who usually carry the highestburden of housework alonso et al 2019 alon et al 2020 are bearing most of the epidemicrelated costs triggered by school closures and the health risks posed to elderly family members uncertainty about schools reopening and fears of contagion of the most vulnerable can lead to women exiting the labour force for a prolonged period of time entailing longterm costs to their careers third in developing countries the burden on the healthcare system is reducing access to family planning and increasing the chances of maternal mortality unpa women 2020 finally in many developing economies where girls in normal times already feel the pressure to drop out of school the covid19 crisis may induce even more female dropouts dropping out from school creates a permanent loss in human capital and narrows girls chances of improving their living standards note social sectors are defined as the sum of the following sectors wholesale and retail trade accommodation and food service activities real estate business and administrative activities education human health and social work activities and other services the policy challenge gender equality boosting growth and reducing poverty and inequality policymakers around the world are focusing on responding to the crisis immediate effects fighting the devastating impact of the pandemic on peoples lives and national healthcare systems deb et al 2020 queisser at al 2020 as well as trying to maintain functioning economies nevertheless policymakers must also plan for the future how can we return to a path of sustainable economic growth and regain the lost ground in gender equality while fighting poverty and inequality these are daunting tasks – but genderresponsive fiscal policies can help the appropriate set of policies will depend among other things on the countrys level of development for example ensuring access to caregiving support when economic activities outside of the household resume is crucial for women to be able to go back to work in the developed world in developing countries increasing efforts to keep girls in school is key for building and protecting future human capital as shown in our recent paper fabrizio et al 2020 fiscal policies that address gender equality such as investing in education and infrastructure subsidising childcare and offering parental leave can create economic opportunities for women these policies also generate economic growth and reduce poverty and inequality while paying for themselves in the long run for example • subsidised childcare the high cost and uneven supply of childcare represents a barrier for many women particularly the lowskilled and poor to participate in the labour force poor women typically face higher childcare costs relative to their income for example in the us poorer women spend 174 of their income on childcare compared to 78 for richer women these women are also at higher risk of losing their jobs because of the current pandemic subsidising childcare is a ‘winwin policy it stimulates female labour force participation and generates jobs in the childcare sector for illustration lifecycle model simulations suggest that expanding childcare subsidies in order to reduce its cost by half for middleclass working mothers in the us would lead to an increase in female labour force participation by almost five percentage points women at the bottom of the income distribution that currently do not have access to the child care development fund would benefit the most our paper shows that this policy would reduce poverty in the us by up to 02 percentage points and increase economic activity by up to 05 percent by widening the pool of workers • investing in education as argued above the covid19 crisis can hamper progress made in closing gender gaps in education as girls are usually the first to drop out of school if families need additional help at home a more educated labour force is more resilient and flexible closing gender gaps in education boosts female human capital raising womens expected salaries and giving them more incentives to pursue careers on aggregate this would also positively impact productivity for the future thus accelerating economic growth for illustration lifecycle model simulations suggest that investing sufficiently in education to close gender gaps at each income level in senegal could boost output by almost 9 while reducing poverty by more than ten percentage points and cut inequality as measured by the gini coefficient by almost three percentage points the covid19 pandemic is affecting all countries destroying jobs increasing poverty and putting at risk the hardwon gender equality gains of the last few decades policymakers around the world are rightly focusing on responding to the immediate crisis fighting the devastating effects of the pandemic on healthcare systems whist trying to keep their economies alive the next step is to find the tools to sustain economic growth fight poverty and regain the lost ground in gender

interview mp says her party must escape its mythology be tough on china and unite voters|the protective metal boards surrounding winston churchills statue in parliament square came down this week ahead of french president emmanuel macrons visit to london to mark a wartime anniversary but the debate over britains public monuments is not over and oxfords oriel college said this week that it would move a statue of 19thcentury imperialist cecil rhodes from its front entrance boris johnson said on monday that instead of taking down controversial statues britain should put up new ones pointing to empty plinths in the courtyard of the foreign and commonwealth office that were waiting to be occupied by contemporary heroes labours shadow foreign secretary lisa nandy suggested that it was time to take a look at the art inside that building notably a series of murals by sigismund goetze celebrating the expansion of the british empire one of which depicts africa as a small naked boy carrying a basket of fruit “as we leave the european union and start to reach out to other parts of the world those relationships become incredibly important to us particularly relationships with commonwealth countries and countries that were part of the empire” nandy said in a zoom interview from her home in wigan this week “there is a very mixed legacy across the world for britain in relation to that and some of the works of art on display at the foreign office do not project the sort of relationship and the high esteem in which we hold those countries and they depict many of those former empire countries as bending at the knee of the mighty british empire when what we seek in modern times is a partnership with those countries based on their strengths assets and attributes and our own as well” nandys family background embraces two sides of the legacy of the british empire her father was dipak nandy a marxist academic who moved to britain from kolkata and helped to draft the race relations act in 1976 her mother louise byers who was the daughter of liberal mp frank byers worked as a tv current affairs producer the mp for wigan since 2010 nandy served in the shadow cabinet under ed miliband and jeremy corbyn but she resigned from corbyns team in two thousand and sixteen and backed owen smiths unsuccessful leadership challenge she ran for the leadership this year coming third behind keir starmer and rebecca longbailey the campaign enhanced nandys reputation however as she outperformed her rivals in tv interviews and revealed herself to be a more complex politician than many labour members had known for the past few years nandy has been associated with efforts to keep labour connected to its traditional heartlands outside london championing the interests of towns and opposing the push for a second brexit referendum she lost the argument within the party before the election when she was calling for labour to join forces with moderate conservatives to back a soft brexit deal but she is now in the mainstream alongside labour leader starmer in accepting that the central brexit argument is over and refusing to press the government to extend the transition period beyond the end of this year “weve been smashed apart in the labour party over brexit not just our electoral coalition but our party membership our members of parliament as well over the last four years but were now in a position where we saw the entire labour base collapse beneath our feet in many of those parts of the country that voted to leave and that had traditionally voted labour through three successive generations” she said “i think theres now a recognition right across the labour movement that weve got to get a deal by the end of the year and weve also got to stand up for those very close deep relationships with the eu as a whole and with individual countries within the european union more generally” nandy says that labours foreign policy will not change in its essentials and the party will remain internationalist in outlook with a commitment to human rights and the rule of law but she has adopted a tougher stance on china finding common cause with some conservative mps in questioning the role of chinese companies like huawei in british infrastructure “we think you need a twinpillar strategy in relation to china on the one hand you need the strategic independence by investing in homegrown industry and by building those alliances overseas to give us a degree of detachment that allows us to speak and act from a position of values” she said “but equally you need a level of constructive engagement with china there is no global challenge that can be solved without the involvement of the chinese government whether its covid19 climate change or the issues in the world economy reform of our major institutions china remains a very very important partner for the world often the situation with the us and china is likened to the cold war we believe it isnt at all its far more complex than the cold war and weve got to maintain those links” labour has remained part of the party of european socialists and nandy believes the party can learn from the experience of other centreleft parties she suggests that most such parties have faced the same challenge of trying to keep together two parts of an electoral coalition that have experienced globalisation very differently although she recognises how steep labours challenge is she draws some hope from the fact that the party under starmer recognises that it must move beyond what she calls the “one more heave” mentality “theres a sort of mythology on the left around and around our history in britain that after the war the country realised that this was a huge moment when things had to change and we were propelled to power where we built the institutions the nhs and the welfare state that have lasted to this day now that is true but what we forget is that six years later we were out of power and weve largely been in retreat trying to defend those institutions ever since “so theres a real need for labour to go out into the country and start to make the case for how were going to bring different parts of the country together particularly with the length and depth of the recession thats about to hit” she said “i think that is likely to be concentrated in many of those areas that already lacked the resilience before so coastal towns which are heavily reliant on the tourism industry are likely to see a disproportionate impact and weve got a lot of exindustrial towns where the last labour government used the public sector to try to kickstart the economy and as the public sector is contracted thats left us with a real problem “the other jobs that exist in those places are not wellpaid whitecollar jobs theyre the insecure agency jobs so for all of those reasons the parts of the country that were seeking to win back at the next election are going to feel the impact of this economic recession harder and weve got to make sure that we are their champion”|2020-06-20|0.9939|positive|0.06707383357383359|positive
a handful of geishas now offer their traditional arts in the most modern of formats – zoom calls|japanese geisha chacha sits on her knees with her fingertips neatly placed on the wooden floor gracefully bowing to an audience sitting not in front of her but miles away watching online beneath spotlights the graceful 32yearold geisha performs a traditional dance moving like a butterfly and artfully unfolding and fluttering her fan the audience would usually be a group of older wealthy men watching appreciatively inside a traditional parlour lined with woven tatami mats but today chachas audience is looking back at her from a computer screen and ranges from a young woman with a glass of wine in her hand to a family with several curious children how have you been at home asked chacha addressing her audience i was playing animal crossing all the time during the state of emergency she added while japan has been spared the worst of the coronavirus outbreak a state of emergency was declared during a spike in cases and the pandemic has nixed most forms of nightlife including geisha parties despite western misconceptions geishas are not prostitutes but rather entertainers and raconteurs highly skilled in traditional japanese dance musical instruments and games almost everything in the repertoire of these performers – from singing and dancing in small enclosed spaces to entertaining customers with witty conversation and delicately pouring sake in a customers cup – is at odds with the social distancing rules of the coronavirus pandemic that has been devastating for geisha like chacha who has seen her salary evaporate and is eagerly awaiting the arrival of government stimulus funds usually we are very busy in april may and june she told afp but this year we have no parties zero thats where the online service has come in it grew from a project called meet geisha – initially conceived as a way to bring groups of tourists to see geisha perform on stage in a more relaxed and less intimidating environment launched last year by an it firm it was supposed to capitalise on an influx of tourists including those coming for the tokyo two thousand and twenty olympics but with the coronavirus pandemic forcing the postponement of the games and shutting down international travel the firm looked at other options they approached the geisha community in hakone around 80km southwest of tokyo about an online option said project manager tamaki nishimura they are up for new challenges not necessarily bound by traditional styles she told afp while geisha culture is strongly associated with the city of kyoto communities exist throughout japan with about one hundred and fifty active geishas in hakone if it werent for the geishas in hakone i wouldnt probably have gotten a yes for the online service nishimura added chacha admits she was initially confused by the idea – she doesnt own a computer just an ipad and says she has no idea how to even switch one on i had a big question mark in my head she laughed but with nishimuras help to organise the technical side chacha and a handful of other geishas are now able to offer their traditional arts in the most modern of formats – zoom calls the online sessions offer income but also a way to broaden the audience one objective of this service is to reach out to new younger customer groups because the price is set at the cheaper end nishimura said once we had a group of eight young people in south korea who bought this service as a birthday present for one of them that was a way of enjoying this that went beyond what we had expected michiko maeda 65 one of chachas online female guests said the new format had encouraged her to experience the traditional entertainment i think many people feel that geisha entertainment is not really for women she said but once you know women can also enjoy it intially online i think more of us will go and visit hakone geisha parlours right everyone she said as other female guests nodded in agreement on the split screen chacha acknowledges the new technology allows people overseas and those who cannot physically visit hakone to meet me but she is hoping for a return to tradition when the rules allow someday i want them to come here see our performance live and interact with us for real that is what i truly wish for – afp relaxnews|2020-06-20|0.9979|positive|0.07153208674042008|positive

large increases in morbidity and mortality – could pose a challenge to the insurance industry particularly life insurers this column urges central banks looking to preserve credit supply to account for changes in insurer risk appetite which could take place well before capital levels approach regulatory thresholds financial stability assessments should examine the implications of the pandemic for insurers which operate in some countries on a comparable scale to banks while much attention has been paid to the impact of covid19 on banks for examples of prominent early work see beck 2020 cecchetti and schoenholtz 2020 insurers have received less attention insurers are important financial intermediaries holding more than 30 trillion in assets globally fsb 2020 and operating on a comparable scale to banks in some countries covid19 will affect insurers both directly via health shocks increases in mortality and morbidity and indirectly via financial shocks higher credit spreads potentially widespread downgrades lower interest rates and lower equity prices the financial impact of pandemics is often much larger than the direct health impact as even comparatively mild outbreaks can have a large economic footprint mckibbin and fernando 2020 insurers exposure to covid19 varies by their line of business for example life insurers liabilities commit them to payouts decades ahead and are very sensitive to changes in interest rates although these longterm liabilities permit longer investment horizons potentially supporting financial stability chodorowreich et al 2020 iais 2019 life insurers are more directly affected by pandemics through their liabilities if insurers are hit hard risk appetite may be impaired—as was the case following the global financial crisis kirti 2019—affecting the availability of credit for riskier borrowers policymakers working to preserve credit supply to the economy should account for any changes to insurers risk appetite we present estimates of the impact of covid19 on capitalisation levels for us life insurers considering both the direct pandemic shock and the indirect financial shock life insurers provide protection against both mortality and longevity risk joint provision of both types of protection can help insurers manage risk in a pandemic with significant mortality impact life insurance claims rise immediately whereas expected future payments on lifecontingent annuities fall these risks can therefore offset each other from a longterm solvency perspective although large life insurance claims may have a meaningful shortterm impact moreover for annuities in the accumulation phase as is the case for a majority of us annuities account values are typically payable upon death we focus on the impact of potentially larger mortality on life insurance claims we base key assumptions share of population with coverage and average size of policy by age group and the extent to which mortality may be lower conditional on coverage on soa 2007 and apply case fatality rates by age group as experienced in korea a more benign scenario or italy a more severe scenario with limited health care capacity as of early june although the pandemic appears to be tapering in europe and even in the us as of early june 2020 it is difficult to exclude further waves of infections figure one shows the impact on us life insurers as a share of capital given the share of the population affected by covid19 insurers regulators and industry observers typically use an excess death ratio of 15 per 1000 as a standard pandemic stress test scenario in the us this would imply about 500000 deaths about 8 of the population affected with case fatality rates in korea and about 4 with case fatality rates in italy larger than current estimates of the potential death toll released by us authorities in such a scenario losses would be about 15 billion or about 3 of preshock industry capital4 should the pandemic prove challenging to control with treatment and vaccines remaining elusive an extreme scenario more comparable to the one thousand nine hundred and eighteen spanish flu closer to 30 of the population affected with case fatality rates in korea could become relevant in such a scenario losses would be about 4555 billion—about 10 of preshock capital such a scenario would likely unfold over multiple years giving insurers time to accumulate additional net premium income figure one impact of potential mortality claims on us life insurer regulatory capital sources sp global market intelligence and imf staff analysis note this figure shows the us life insurance industrys aggregate capital net of pretax excess claims as a function of the share of population infected estimates are based on the agegroupspecific number of policyholders and average face amount in force used by soa 2007 adjusted to match the current us population and stock of life insurance in force net of reinsurance as of end two thousand and nineteen close to 20 trillion case fatality rates by age group as of three june two thousand and twenty are from the italian national institute of health and the korean ministry of health and welfare case fatality rates are assumed to be 23 lower for the insured population as in the severe scenario used by soa 2007 us life insurers are generally not required to mark bonds to market for the purpose of determining regulatory capital capital requirements for us insurers are tied to regulatory risk categorisation of assets for most asset classes regulatory risk categories are a function of credit ratings us life insurers holdings are somewhat skewed toward bonds only one or two rating notches above regulatory thresholds for significantly higher risk weights kirti and shin 2020 becker and ivashina 2015vii risk weights for junk bonds are more than triple those for investment grade bonds downgraded bonds tend to be sold by insurers facing capital pressure ellul et al 2011 we focus on the impact of bond downgrades on required capital despite unprecedented policy responses from monetary and fiscal authorities many corporate issuers may face rating downgrades due to the widespread economic fallout from covid19 the extent to which some sectors will face serious solvency concerns in any ‘new normal is not yet clear if downgrades move assets into higherrisk regulatory categories capital requirements would increase downgraded bonds may see fire sales particularly if downgrades are widespread although selling distressed assets would potentially trigger recognition of losses that permanently impair regulatory capital for us insurers which would disincentivise fire sales we use bondlevel holdings data for all us life insurers as of the fourth quarter of 2019 along with bond ratings and downgrades as of endmay more than 60 billion in bond holdings have already been downgraded across categories while 210 billion have been downgraded at least one rating notch we consider two further scenarios a moderate scenario in which 50 of bonds by value one notch away from regulatory thresholds are downgraded into the next category along with 25 of bonds two notches away and a severe scenario with double these downgrade rates figure two shows how riskbased capital rbc ratios the ratio of actual capital held to required capital would be affected under different scenarios us insurers must submit corrective action plans if their rbc ratio is below 150 and has a negative trend or falls below 100 and can be placed under regulatory control if their rbc ratio falls below 5010 the median rbc ratio is above 400 with some insurers already below 200 the severe downgrade scenario would significantly lower rbc ratios and bring some insurers close to or below

government for the covid crisis there was a lot going on in britain in early march london staged an englandwales rugby match on march 7th which the prime minister attended along with a crowd of 81000 on march 11th liverpool played atletico madrid in front of a crowd of 52000 fans including 3000 from spain 252000 punters went to the cheltenham festival one of the countrys poshest steeplechase meetings which ended on march 13th as britons were getting together to amuse themselves and infect each other europe was shutting down borders were closing public gatherings being banned italy went into full lockdown on march 9th denmark on march 11th spain on march 14th and france on march 17th britain followed only on march 23rd putting in place sweeping restrictions on everyday life was a difficult decision fraught with uncertainty yet the delay is just one example of the governments tardiness britain has been slow to increase testing identify a contacttracing app stop visits to care homes ban big public events provide its health workers with personal protective equipment ppe and require people to wear face coverings on public transport as this wave of the disease ebbs britons are wondering how they came to have the highest overall death rate of any country in the rich world and why leaving lockdown is proving so difficult the evidence so far suggests that the british government played a bad hand badly the country was always going to struggle the virus took off in london an international hub britain has a high proportion of ethnicminority people who are especially vulnerable to the disease and britons are somewhat overweight which exacerbates the impact of the infection britain has got some things right its researchers have been in the forefront of the race to find drugs and create vaccines against the disease on june 16th a trial by oxford university the first to identify a lifesaving medicine showed that a cheap steroid can reduce mortality among the sickest patients by a third a swift reorganisation of the national health service put paid to fears that it would be overwhelmed but the government has wasted the most precious commodity in a crisis time in a federal system like americas the central governments failings can be mitigated by state and local authorities in a centralised system they cannot hindsight is a fine thing and offers a clarity that is absent in the blizzard of events yet it is now plain that britains scientists initially argued for the wrong approach accepting that the disease would spread through the population while protecting the vulnerable and the health service neil ferguson an epidemiologist at imperial college london estimates that had britain locked down a week earlier at least half of the 50000orso lives that have been lost would have been saved this is more britons than have died in any event since the second world war in retrospect the government should have probed the scientists advice more deeply some of it was questionable the received wisdom that people would tire of social distancing and that shutting down early would mean loosening early too was just a hunch even after the evidence changed and it became clear the country was heading for catastrophe the government was slow to impose the sort of lockdown seen across europe yet you do not need hindsight to identify other mistakes delays in fixing ppe supply chains promoting face coverings and increasing testing capacity were clearly errors at the time despite the urging of the countrys scientists and the world health organisation by the middle of april britain was still carrying out just 12000 tests a day compared with 44000 in italy and 51000 in germany because most testing was reserved for hospitals care homes struggled to find out which of their residents and staff were infected competition for ppe was fierce so they also struggled to get the kit they needed to protect their workers the government is not solely to blame the pandemic made new demands on the system some crucial bits of machinery did not work the publicly owned company which supplies the health service with ppe failed public health england which was responsible for testing and tracing failed but there was a failure of leadership too when systems break it is the governments job to mend them when the evidence argues for drastic measures ministers need to take them britain is still living with the consequences the spread of the virus and the devastation it has wrought have made leaving lockdown difficult as shown by the halting return of pupils to school only five yeargroups have gone back many parents are choosing to keep their children at home and the government has abandoned an earlier ambition to get more in the “worldbeating” contacttracing system still lacks its app which is not due to arrive until winter slow progress at suppressing the virus will have grave economic consequences too these shortcomings have claimed many victims among them is public trust britain went into this crisis with a powerful sense of unity and goodwill towards the government now britons think worse of their governments performance during the crisis than do the citizens of any of twentytwo countries polled by yougov aside from mexico that reflects the governments mistakes and its hypocrisy after the prime ministers main adviser broke its own rules about when to travel—and kept his job while the world waits for a vaccine this lack of trust will make managing the disease a lot harder the painful conclusion is that britain has the wrong sort of government for a pandemic—and in boris johnson the wrong sort of prime minister elected in december with the slogan of “get brexit done” he did not pay covid19 enough attention ministers were chosen on ideological grounds talented candidates with the wrong views were left out in the cold mr johnson got the top job because he is a brilliant campaigner and a charismatic entertainer with whom the conservative party fell in love beating the coronavirus calls for attention to detail consistency and implementation but they are not his forte the pandemic has many lessons for the government which the inevitable public inquiry will surely clarify here is one for voters when choosing a person or party to vote for do not underestimate the importance of

board didnt sound surprised at golfs first positive test the whole plan put in place was not if but when somebody tests positive whats the protocol and what are the next steps spieth said so i feel confident just in being on those phone calls in what the pga tour is going to do going forward hopefully contact tracing doesnt lead to anybody else testing positive within the bubble the tour said in

said he had no close contact with watney on thursday and he washed his hands immediately after the round nick never coughed or sneezed so i feel comfortable he said as part of the contact tracing plan

was a week before he returned — explosively — to a tv analyst role with sky sports savaging manchester united goalkeeper david de gea and defender harry maguire at halftime in fridays 11 draw at tottenham for many the real talking point on the night was keane rather than the game but that was hardly a surprise for he has always been box office barry egan whats the difference between roy keane the football legend and roy keane the man who walks his dog roy keane im not into all this legend stuff you put your boots on now and youre a legend particularly in ireland you play five games for ireland and youre a legend you score one goal youre a legend scratch your arse and youre a legend when i was going to matches — and i had this throughout my career going back to rockmount — i was going to work    i was going to work and id like to think i am a different person away from my job im not saying its chalk and cheese but i was going to earn a living trying to help my team win a match at every level i have played i was trying to win matches since i was eight years of age i took football very very seriously be do you ever think about things like your legacy rk nah listen thats certainly not something i would be comfortable with thats not my scene if i had a bucket in front of me now id be throwing up be if i told you that you couldnt play youd be more comfortable rk im more comfortable with criticism youre right rk it keeps you on your toes be did you get positive stuff from your family growing up rk laughs no not really are you joking i still havent got it christ almighty it didnt work that way as you know typical irish family just got on with it my family will probably tell me that my three brothers were better players than me be and were they rk id say so yeah they were very good players they played at a very good level and if they had the luck i had it could have been them most sports people werent as good as they thought they were i never won a trophy in my career at man united or celtic or rockmount the team did be where did that come from rk from eight years of age i played the game to win would i give that advice to kids now obviously not but i played to win i was from a competitive family im a keane but my mothers a lynch sport is in her family i have sport running through my blood so along the way i was going to push people i had to a good old irish friend said to me years ago ‘roy you just need to lighten up a small bit and i try i try to lighten up but regarding football i couldnt lighten up because if i lightened up too much in football i would never have got to england and if i did i wouldnt have lasted two minutes i had to be intense i had to train properly i had to push myself i had to push people around me i dont make apologies for that that was who i was even preseason any game i ever took it easy in i guarantee you i was the worst player on the park i couldnt do it i just couldnt do it it just wasnt in my makeup and sometimes that would rattle a few people even in training id go ‘i cant do it take it easier i wish i could i just cant i wish i had you know when you want to let a bit of steam off i couldnt if i thought ‘weve no game for two weeks and my hamstring is a bit tight ill just go easy i couldnt do it i had to be full pelt be why was that rk fear fear of failure fear of letting people down when i came to england i had wanted to be a professional player for a long time i wanted to win trophies i wanted security for my family i wanted a nice house i wanted a nice holiday i wanted a nice car be what are you frightened of now some people who have that fear earlier on in life it just keeps transferring on to other fears rk not for me thank god it was that football bubble that i was in there is no guarantee that ill be doing tv next year there are no deals lined up im speaking to one or two but if none of these things fall into place i am actually quite relaxed and maybe thats because i am out of football now i have always loved the game i dont always like what goes on around the game if people want to pigeonhole me and say ‘hes this or that the legend stuff or ‘hes an oddball    listen my job was to win football matches and generally speaking the teams i played with were all okay with my attitude to the game did i always get it right i made mistakes like everybody else be what mistakes did you make rk stuff like letting teammates down by getting sent off sometimes i would try and push them sometimes i was too hard sometimes i was too soft if i was critical looking back on my own career and how i dealt with people even in management — and people mightnt believe this — but i reckon that sometimes i was too nice to people rk absolutely yeah that was one of my weaknesses being too nice i try and look after people i try and please people and you end up trying to please everyone and we all know what happens to people who try to please everybody you come unstuck i had that in my career the bottom line is i finished at thirtyfour because of the injuries the guilt is part of being a sportsperson you play when you shouldnt not the other way around i put my body on the line when really i should have been strong enough to say ‘im not fit today im not fit to train i was constantly pushing myself and you get criticised for missing games because you were injured as i say all the experts are out there there is always that element going on when you are in top level sport even dealing with managers or players sometimes i turned a blind eye i was too nice to them and then eventually when people trust you and they think theyve got    whats the word im looking for eventually they think they can take the mick out of you obviously people stab you in the back people stabbed me right in my chest it wasnt in my back because i was too nice to them be who stabbed you in the chest rk theres plenty theres plenty plenty stabbed me right in the chest people who i thought i trusted throughout my life whether it be contract stuff managers people thats what they do thats the nature of the game were in with football i understand that its tough going youre battling on the pitch youre battling off the pitch whether it be injuries or contracts or the way people are treating you and sometimes you have to put a front on because of the position i played in the middle of the park people were hitting me i was hitting them every time people talk about my career they talk about the people i tackled or hurt forgetting obviously that i was hurt quite a number of times myself but thats the kind of game people play thats the deal its give and take but this idea that youre working with good people all the time    ive been very very lucky some of the best people in my life the majority of people i know are through football but i met people as well who i still regret that i got involved with a number of people people i trusted rk im talking about a number of people listen dont be putting words in my mouth here im talking about a number of people here and not automatically just united i have been involved with other clubs and i have been involved with ireland and from a players point of view i have been involved with offfield stuff whether it be people doing contracts    whatever it might be and there are a number of people who i look back now and go ‘shame shame on you be was it that much of a shock to you that a big corporation like manchester united would treat you the way they did in the end rk i didnt say it was a shock where did i say it was shock i never mentioned united put it this way im certainly not the first or the last player to be treated badly by a club i read that poor tony dunne passed away the other day and from what i hear and read and i know you cant believe everything he was very disappointed with the way he was treated so again im not the first it doesnt keep me awake at night be is there anything that does rk at the moment no no no sleeping well be what about covid19 rk you know i havent been too bad i know people are suffering and it has been a huge setback obviously i am very lucky i was supposed to have some work the usual stuff i had the euros coming up but in terms of dealing with it and being in the house with the family and all if im honest ive enjoyed it

plaquemines st bernard and eastern orleans parishes it appears fishing has returned to near normal catches then last weekends strong east winds didnt help the bugaboo now is the storm broke up the shrimp pods and made it more difficult for shrimpers to scratch out a living and it also meant that fishermen arent finding the big schools of trout feeding on those shrimp that usually happens later in the summer ok so summer became official saturday after brown shrimp that havent been caught move to the coast and begin a westward migration towards texas so instead of sitting in one spot and hooking enough trout for a big family weekend feast the best way to continue a mornings fishing is to consider charting a plan to move from place to place to fill out a limit whatever that means to an individual angler these days when the big piles of shrimp up trout tend to break up too it means youre not likely to find a motherlode of trout in any spot along a beach or a cut or a point or a platform just because some of the trout that set up home in those places moved to follow the shrimp yes you can still find live shrimp at the baithouses and you can find enough speckled trout to make a trip worth your while but youll just have to work and stay out a little longer to do it with the black cloud of covid19 lingering it was sad to learn this years fourth of july golden meadowfourchon

how weak the global economy is this column uses gwi to assess the repercussions of the coronavirus covid19 crisis in real time it finds that after the release of certain soft indicators on two march 2020 the gwi increased sharply – much faster than in the two thousand and eight crisis moreover the index remained at a record high at the time of writing fourteen may 2020 the covid19 crisis has once again shown how important it is to be able to assess economic conditions in real time although it has been clear since early march that some economies are sliding into recession until very recently the standard measures – based on lowfrequency indicators with publication delays – were silent about the increasing probability of recession in most advanced and emerging economies in order to solve this problem various researchers have developed nonlinear models based on several timely indicators unlike many other models the markovswitching dynamic factor msdf models introduced by chauvet 1998 have been successfully used to account for comovements and nonlinearities across several economic indicators these models have widely proven their ability to quickly identify turning points in msdf models the economy is assumed to switch between expansions and recessions with constant probabilities expansions and recessions are respectively characterised by high and low growth rates of the various activity indicators conditional on being in each state the indicators including gdp move around these highlow growth rates following hamilton 1989 previous msdf models have assumed that these two growth rates are the same for all the expansions and recessions in the sample this article explains how we leivaleon et al 2020 estimate such a model using timely indicators while also allowing for recessions to differ in depth to allow for this possibility has two advantages first allowing for the mean to vary across recessions is helpful because once an economy has suffered a ‘severe recession such as the global crisis the model might not be able to identify an upcoming ‘mild recession this lack of sensitivity of the model comes from the fact that the estimated growth rate of recessions might be too low to capture ‘mild recession periods second as the growth rate of every recession is different the model delivers realtime estimates of the depth of every recession which provides valuable information to rapidly design and implement the necessary policy responses this is especially important in the deep covid19 recession that we are currently experiencing data sample and technical features of the model an msdf with recessions of varying depth is estimated independently for twelve of the largest economic regions of the world which together account for more than 70 of world gdp six of them are advanced while the rest are emerging economies we use supplyside variables usually industrial production internal demand variables imports or sales external demand exports as well as one additional variable specific to each economy which is usually a soft indicator such as the pmi all of these variables are measure at a monthly frequency in addition the models contain gdp as a quarterly variable the main advantage of relying exclusively on real variables is that we capture all types of recessions whether they originate in the financial sector energy prices a pandemic or any other cause whatever is its origin as long as there is an effect on the economy the effect will be reflected in these variables for every economy both the probabilities of recessions and the depth of every recession are endogenously estimated no external dating is used figure one plots recession probabilities for the different regions on two march 2020 the first day in which the model captured a serious increase in global weakness and on fourteen may 2020 the day of the writing of this article note the heatmap of the world plots the overall pattern of the probabilities of the low economic activity regime for specific dates the darker lighter the area the higher lower the probability of recession the animated sequence of world heatmaps from april two thousand and three until february two thousand and twenty can be found here the information contained in figure one can be summarised in an index – the global weakness index gwi it is a weighted average of the probabilities of recession in different economies the weights depend on the gdp of each region in every quarter figure two plots the gwi computed on the same dates shown in figure 1 as the chart shows there is a sharp increase as early as two march which is confirmed by the latest numbers of fourteen may where the gwi ends up close to 1 the index can be interpreted as the proportion of the world economy that is currently in recession note the figure shows the global weakness index which is constructed as a weighted average of the probabilities of the low economic activity regime across economies it is weighted by the size of the corresponding economies the red area represents the credible set based on the 16th and 84th percentiles of the posterior distribution given that the index is computed as a weighted average of the individual economies it can be broken down by the individual contributors each economys contribution depends on the weight of that economy in world gdp and the probability of that economy being in a recession the contribution of the different economic areas can be seen in figure 3 it shows that at the beginning of march only china was clearly in a recession but recently the us and the euro area have also been large contributors to the high level of the index note the radar chart shows the relative contribution of each economy to the gwi the contributions are normalised to sum up to one all in all the gwi as an indicator has four key benefits it is 3 useful for quantifying risks and our model includes gdp as one of its indicators so it can be used to provide forecasts for gdp as a matter of fact computing the probability of negative growth or two quarters of negative growth ie the probability of a recession according to its classical definition is quite straightforward in the case of the euro area the latest figures suggest that the probability of a classical recession has reached 100 we present a new indicator of global economic weakness which uses realtime information available to estimate the proportion of the world economy that is in a recession the indicator is based on the estimation of a dynamic nonlinear factor model for individual economies which considers recessions of different depths in our recent research leivaleon et al 2020 we show the excellent realtime forecasting properties of this model for individual economies as this article illustrates the indicator already pointed to clear signs of economic weakness as early as two march 2020 this weakness was confirmed by official statistics on fourteen may 2020 when q1 gdp data for most countries were released therefore this indicator helps provide early warnings of a downturn that can be crucial for a fast policy response camacho m g perezquiros and p poncela 2018

of media attention this column examines whether the gender of the national leader truly makes a significant difference to the number of covid19 cases and deaths in the first quarter of the pandemic with differences in lockdown timing examined as a plausible explanation for these patterns the findings show that covid outcomes are systematically better in countries led by women insights from behavioural studies and leadership literature are used to speculate on the sources of these differences as well as on their implications on eight june 2020 new zealand was declared virusfree and prime minister jacinda ardern lifted all restrictions except stringent border controls grahammclay 2020 with fewer than five hundred confirmed cases and seven deaths from the virus taiwan under the presidency of tsai ingwen is seen to have performed very well germany under angela merkel has done better than most european countries in the first quarter of the covid pandemic hartl et al 2020 the performance of these female leaders in the covid pandemic offers a unique global experiment in national crisis management and has given rise to much media attention this is a significant shift from the maledominated view of history within which events are typically considered as determined by the instrumental and causal influence of a small number of ‘great men eg keegan 2003 but does this association stand up to systematic scrutiny leaders gender in the fight against the pandemic in a new paper garikipati and kambhampati 2020 we consider whether there are significant differences in the covidoutcomes of male and female ledcountries in the first quarter of the pandemic we also consider whether these differences can be explained by differences in policy measures adopted by male and female leaders in particular we consider the timing of lockdown in these countries anything said about the pandemic now has to be qualified by the fact that we are only at the start of the pandemic much could change in the next few months our analysis therefore relates to the immediate reaction of leaders to the first wave of the crisis another qualification to keep in mind is the quality of data currently available in particular with the shortage of test kits testing has been poor baunez et al 2020 and therefore case numbers are an underestimate while data on deaths are more reliable there are concerns about its comparability across countries in some countries if a covidpositive individual dies the death is registered as a covid death irrespective of any other previous illness such as tuberculosis or cancer but this is not standard or mandatory so practice varies across countries we begin by looking at some summary statistics table one presents covid19 cases and deaths by gender of the countrys leaders it confirms that femaleled countries have fared better in terms of absolute number of covid19 cases and deaths with maleled countries having nearly double the number of deaths as femaleled ones however drawing anything conclusive from these raw comparisons is difficult due to the massive underrepresentation of femaleled countries in the sample we have only nineteen countries across the world being led by women compared with the one hundred and seventyfour in our sample that are maleled table one covid19 cases and deaths in countries by gender of national leader source dataset constructed by authors from various sources to overcome the difficulty of imbalanced sample sizes we ‘match each of the femaleled countries with their nearest neighbour we use several sociodemographic and economic characteristics that have been seen as important in the transmission of covid19 as matching variables we begin by considering key demographic and national wealth indicators including gdp population over sixtyfive years and population in urban agglomerations as these have emerged as the most relevant sá 2020 figure one below illustrates some examples of comparing covid19 cases and deaths in femaleled countries with their near neighbour matched by size of population when matched like this it is clear that femaleled countries have fewer cases and fewer deaths and have locked down earlier than male countries with respect to cases and deaths following discussions in the literature we also extend matching to include other variables such as expenditure on health and tourism we also include gender equality as a matching variable as having equitable institutions may contribute to a general resilience that becomes confounded with having a female leader nearest neighbour analysis clearly confirms that when womenled countries are compared to countries similar to them along a range of characteristics they have performed better experiencing fewer cases as well as fewer deaths this is true whether we consider the nearest neighbour the nearest two three or even five neighbours the results are especially highly significant in the case of the number of deaths experienced by femaleled countries these results remain robust when we drop countries that have been in the covid spotlight – the us germany and new zealand – from our sample to see if they might be driving the results we find that these changes in the sample only strengthen the results what is also clear from our analysis is that timing of lockdown has been driving the better outcomes in femaleled countries femaleled countries locked down significantly earlier ie when they were seeing fewer deaths 22 fewer than maleled countries our nearest neighbour matching estimates confirm this result at a very high level of significance while this may have longerterm economic implications it has certainly helped these countries to save lives assenza et al 2020 why have women leaders decided to lock down their countries earlier than male leaders figure one covid19 cases and deaths comparing femaleled and maleled countries with similar populations source covid19 cases and deaths extracted from the worldometer website httpswwwworldometersinfo one explanation for genderdifferences in the propensity to lock down early might be found in the literature on attitudes to risk and uncertainty which suggests that women even those in leadership roles appear to be more riskaverse than men eg croson and gneezy 2009 charness and gneezy 2012 indeed in the current crisis several incidents of risky behaviour by male leaders have been reported particularly noteworthy among these are brazils jair bolsonaros dismissal of covid19 as “a little flu or a bit of a cold” ajzenman et al 2020 while attending an antilockdown protest in april similarly britains boris johnson is reported to have said “i was at a hospital where there were a few coronavirus patients and i shook hands with everybody” as reported in lewis 2020 however while women leaders were risk averse with regard to lives they were prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early thus risk aversion may manifest differently in different domains – human life versus economic outcomes – with women leaders being significantly more risk averse in the domain of human life but more risk taking in the domain of the economy we find some support for this idea in studies that examine risk taking behaviour when lotteries are framed as losses men are found to be more risk averse than women when lotteries are framed as financial losses rather than gains schubert et al 1999 moore and eckel 2006 it could well be that the relatively late lockdown decisions by male leaders may reflect male risk aversion to anticipated losses from locking down the economy the neuroscience literature also throws light on sexdifferences in feelings of empathy which cannot be fully explained as cultural derivatives of socialisation alone but have deeper neurobiological drivers eckel and grossman 2002 there exist quantitative gender differences in the basic networks involved in affective and cognitive forms of empathy as well as a qualitative divergence between the sexes in how emotional information is integrated to support decision making processes christovmoore et al 2014 when combined with the findings from the risk literature we begin to see how women leaders could have been riskaverse about anticipated losses to human life while at the same time taking risk with negative financial outcomes associated with early lockdown another explanation of gender differences in response to the pandemic is to be found in the leadership literature where strong evidence can be found to suggest that men and women differ in their leadership styles eagly and johnson 1990 through a metaanalysis of research that compares male and female leadership styles find that leadership styles were gender stereotypic with men likely to lead in a ‘taskoriented style and women in an ‘interpersonally oriented manner consistent with this finding women tended to adopt a more democratic and participative style evidence also suggests that good communications skills are important for women to be chosen as leaders and that this is one of the key attributes in managing a crisis lemoine et al 2016 indeed the decisive and clear communication styles adopted by several female leaders have received much praise in the ongoing crisis eg henley and roy 2020 mclean 2020 taub 2020 thus in norway prime minister erna solberg spoke direct to children answering their questions while in new zealand prime minster ardern was praised for the way in which she communicated and for checking in with her citizens

bit parts and big waits fathers have limited time with partners in leadup to new arrivals|ben lowe and sam hartigan were keenly aware of the bit parts they had been assigned in the drama in which their wives about to give birth were the stars and both clearly understood what they were missing out on as their partners were led off to the wards to go through the early stages of labour without them covid19 restrictions in place in the national maternity hospital – and other maternity units across the state – have meant that for more than three months some 2000 fathers have been unable to spend much time with their partners in the leadup to new arrivals and even less time with their babies once they have come kicking and screaming into the world but both of these fathers knew their absence was a price worth paying to keep their babies their partners and those caring for them safe from harm the drama for the lowes and the hartigans started early on monday morning “sorchas waters broke so we rushed into hospital but when got there at around 6am we were told she wasnt in active labour so she was diverted to an antenatal ward and i was told to go home” sam hartigan recalled he returned to their home in dún laoghaire and less than three hours later a call came from a hospital midwife that it was time “i was back at 930am and eli was born shortly after 2pm” eli is the couples first child and while they dont have anything to compare the birth experience to sam is acutely aware things were not normal “the experience was definitely different to what it would have been precovid” he said “id just over an hour with eli before i had to go that was tough i went home and thought i might get some sleep but i just couldnt i was buzzing and pacing around i didnt know what to do with myself” it was the middle of the week when he spoke to the irish times and he already had plans for his first fathers day “ive everything ready the room is all set up and the car seat is locked and loaded i wish they were home” within hours his wish had been granted and the small family unit were together the lowes story started in a similar fashion “we woke up at 5am on monday and tracy was having contractions so we raced into holles street” ben said “i was allowed to stay to get her checked in but then they said she wasnt in active labour so i had to leave we live in wicklow town and the midwife advised me against going too far” so he sat in the car for thirty minutes and exchanged multiple texts with tracey “it was very frustrating to not be by her side even though when our son michael was born seven years ago i did feel a bit useless like id say most men do” after waiting in the car for a bit he decided to go for a stroll a long long stroll he clocked up thousands of steps over more than four hours walking around the dublin city centre block “i just tried to keep my mind off things i felt like she was in there all on her own even though i knew she was surrounded by these great midwives” the couple continued to exchange text messages until 1130am when tracey went silent “i stopped getting messages” he said “i think i sent at least four she didnt respond to and i was convinced then shed already had the baba i was terrified the hospital had the wrong number for me and couldnt reach me then i got a call from the midwife caroline “she was amazing i happened to be just outside the front door and when i walked into the hospital i passed five hand sanitiser dispensers and used every one of them i didnt take a lift as i was afraid id have to touch something and didnt open any doors with my hands or hold banisters i was just terrified id bring something in with me” he wasnt even in the labour suite for forty minutes before he was cradling his daughter eleanor “wed a few minutes to ourselves just the three of us and that was great amazing but then around half an hour later they were moved to the ward and i had to say my goodbyes that was very hard but im in no way angry the procedures are there to keep everyone safe” he predicted he would be having a different fathers day this year “my wife will tell you i really milk fathers day its nearly fathers month for us and id normally be pleading for a liein it wont be like that this year for sure therell be no lieins”|2020-06-21|0.9272|positive|0.053314597588791146|positive

webb simpson practically had to apologize for a 3under 68 in which he managed just one birdie on the back nine he was part of a fourway tie for the lead and that was good enough for him|hilton head island sc—the pga tours return to competition has brought together the strongest fields of the year on courses that have not been overly punishing and the result is the same its another freeforall at the rbc heritage webb simpson practically had to apologize for a 3under 68 in which he managed just one birdie on the back nine he was part of a fourway tie for the lead and that was good enough for him he also knows good probably wont cut it sunday at harbour town “its not like ive got a three or fourshot lead and could shoot a couple under” he said “its going to take a good one” tyrrell hatton had one of six rounds at 63 giving the 28yearold from england a share of the lead as he goes for his second straight victory albeit three months apart because of the shutdown from the covid19 pandemic abraham ancer so solid with his irons had a sixtyfive and joined the lead along with ryan palmer who had a 66 they were at 15under 198 a number that didnt even start to explain the low scoring even with jordan spieth and xander schauffele sputtering to 75s the field was 223under par the lowest for any round since the rbc heritage began in 1969 there were thirtyfive players at ten under or better — including canadians corey conners 13 and mackenzie hughes 10 — compared with only one player a year ago the previous mark was seven players at double digits under par through fiftyfour holes there were twentyone players separated by just three shots going into the final round a week ago at colonial there were fourteen players separated by three shots “i think the fields have been extremely strong” ancer said “everybody out here was just eager to come out and play the greens are a little bit soft especially this week and the ball isnt really rolling out as much as youre used to on the greens and on the fairways thats yielding a little bit more birdies for sure” carlos ortiz who started this tournament with two double bogeys after playing only five holes suddenly has a chance to grab his first pga tour victory after two eagles in a round of 63 he was one shot behind along with colonial winner daniel berger and joel dahmen both with 63s and there was more testing than usual players and caddies on the charter flight to connecticut for next weeks event had to take a saliva test saturday for the coronavirus before they can get on the plane eleven others had testing friday night because they were deemed to have been in close contact with nick watney whose positive test on friday was the first in golfs return among them was sergio garcia who flew with watney from austin texas the initial test was negative garcia was nervous as he waited for the result though not so nervous he couldnt put down a sixtyfive to join the chase he was two shots behind along with ian poulter and joaquin niemann bryson dechambeau starting the day one shot behind hit his approach into the par5 second in the trees and it never came down he has added forty pounds of mass still not enough to uproot the tree and shake it loose that led to a bogey and more damaging was no birdies on the back nine for a 70 even so he remained three shots behind in a group that included johnson who birdied three of his last four holes to go from around the middle of the pack to 12under 201 three shots behind and very much in the picture thats all it took saturday and it likely wont be any different in the final round brooks koepka quietly posted a sixtyeight and was in the group three shots behind chalk it up to june a new date for the rbc heritage because of the pandemic the tournament usually is the week after the masters in april when the temperature is slightly cooler the greens are firmer and the rye grass hasnt been taken over by bermuda its soft and these are the best players in the world all of them eager to get going again “because were not at a major championshipstyle golf course last week or this week where youre going to have separation because of bad scores i think thats probably why” simpson said when asked to explain the bunched score perhaps that explains why justin thomas called it “the worst sixtysix ive ever shot in my life” hatton has won backtoback before in his career under entirely different circumstances in 2017 he won in scotland and italy in consecutive weeks now he goes after two in a row three months apart having won at bay hill in march before the pandemic shut down sports it apparently wasnt long enough for anyone to accumulate much rush “i think weve all had enough notice to try and get ready to play tournaments again” said hatton who rented a house in orlando fla during the stayathome mandate “so its not massively surprising to see guys playing as well as they are and hopefully the guys at home are enjoying it watching on tv”|2020-06-20|0.9906|positive|0.020219332750582752|positive
president trump is making his return to the campaign trail on saturday with one of his trademarks rallies in tulsa okla where thousands have streamed into the bok center  amid protests outside and lingering controversy over the potential coronavirus risk|president trump roared back onto the campaign trail saturday night with a rally before thousands of supporters in tulsa okla using the fiery and freewheeling appearance to mock democratic foe joe biden criticize those tearing down monuments to controversial historical figures and decry what he described as the “disaster” demonstration in seattle the rally his first in months comes amid prolonged concerns about the coronavirus pandemic and a nationwide outcry over racial injustice in the wake of george floyds death before an enthusiastic and placardwaving crowd  in an arena that still had visible empty seats despite expectations of a packed house  trump described his party as one of equality and justice but also hammered a law and order message in response to those protests that escalated into violence trump specifically tore into the occupation of several blocks in seattle by leftwing protesters which covers an abandoned police precinct saying it is an example of the radical left the occupants whom trump described as anarchists call their area the capitol hill occupied protest or chop were not talking about some little place were talking about seattle trump said criticizing the democratic officials in seattle and washington state he said he had a standing offer that any time you want well come in and straighten out the issues in seattle in an hour or less but he said i may be wrong but its probably better for us to just watch that disaster trump added that a congressman on the flight to the rally told him he shouldnt step in to end the chop occupation in order to let people see what radical left democrats will do to our country he also cited radicals that targeted statues of thomas jefferson and christopher columbus in recent days and said that a law should be passed that burning the american flag results in a year in jail while touting his chances in november trump repeatedly used examples of protesters tearing down monuments and the seattle chop zone as a foil for his “law and order” theme  while insisting biden the presumptive democratic presidential nominee would always cave to such radical parts of his party “do you want to bow before the leftwing mob or do you want to stand up tall and proud as americans” he asked at one point the rallys scathing tone impromptu digressions and political broadsides reflected trump slipping right back into his campaign element after the pandemicinduced hiatus trump also called a boeing official a “dumb son of a b” in describing defense contract negotiations with the company he said he eventually saved “like a billion six or a billion seven” in the negotiation tulsa marked the presidents first rally since early march when both trump and biden canceled inperson campaign events as the seriousness of the coronavirus crisis began to set in but trump who for months has been itching to get the countrys economy back to normal and get himself back in front of supporters at his rallies is the first to resume large inperson events trump also claimed saturday that the silent majority is stronger than ever and touted republicans as the party of abraham lincoln and law and order in comments appearing to indicate how he will frame his reelection campaign as the november election approaches trump made the declarations at tulsas bok center  which itself became an epicenter of controversy amid protests outside and lingering concerns over the potential coronavirus risk of holding the rally in advance of the saturday event trump supporters had been lining up for days to secure their seat in an arena that holds just under 20000 and the trump campaign touted monday receiving over one million ticket requests nevertheless there were a number of empty seats on the upper levels inside the campaign nixed plans for trump to address an overflow crowd at the beginning in the arena trump accused the media of dissuading wouldbe participants campaign manager brad parscale on twitter said radical protestors fueled by a week of apocalyptic media coverage interfered with realdonaldtrump supporters at the rally but rep alexandria ocasiocortez dny  a frequent trump target during the rally  tweeted in response that teens on tiktok had made fake ticket reservations  tricked you into believing a million people wanted your white supremacist open mic enough to pack an arena during covid but the rally despite the hiatus hit the familiar notes trump early in his remarks touted reform to the us department of veterans affairs the breakneck pace at which the senate has confirmed his judicial nominees and tax cut legislation he signed into law i stand before you today to declare that the silent majority is stronger than ever before trump told the raucous crowd five months from now were going to defeat sleepy joe biden were going to stop the radical left were going to build a future of safety and opportunity  republicans are the party of liberty equality and justice for all we are the party of abraham lincoln and we are the party of law and order like in 2016 trump promised that he will release a list of names he could potentially choose from for supreme court nominees earlier this week and reiterated the promise saturday night think how important it is its almost like were a minority court trump said referencing two rulings that went against the positions his administration took this week ill be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the supreme court he continued and ill only pick from that list trump said biden could not release his own supreme court list because his possible nominees would be too radical he also said that biden would stack the tribunal with extremists additionally trump spent a significant amount of time addressing criticism he got for what appeared to be a gingerly walk down a ramp and an awkward sip from a glass of water at a west point graduation earlier this month trump defended himself alluded that joe biden had health issues instead of himself then took a sip of water to loud cheers from the crowd before tossing the water out of the glass thats enough i wanted to tell that story does everybody understand that story the president concluded oklahoma supreme court allows trump rally to proceed as planned tulsa mayor rescinds curfew trump also targeted china over trade concerns and the coronavirus he said that his trade efforts helped american farmers and at one point called the coronavirus the kung flu trump also criticized biden for not agreeing with his decision in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic to close off travel from the country he never did anything against china joe biden trump said the president in comments on the south lawn of the white house on saturday said he was excited to get back among his supporters the event in oklahoma is unbelievable he said the crowds are unbelievable they havent seen anything like it and we will go there now well give a hopefully good speech were gonna see a lot of great people a lot of great friends and pretty much thats it with states reopening after historic economic lockdowns the rally still raised concerns that it could be a super spreader event especially as six members of the trump reelection campaign tested positive for the coronavirus ahead of the event trump prepares for first campaign rally in months in tulsa amid concerns about coronavirus violence per safety protocols campaign staff are tested for covid19 before events trump campaign communications director tim murtaugh said in a statement six members of the advance team tested positive out of hundreds of tests performed and quarantine procedures were immediately implemented no covidpositive staffers or anyone in immediate contact will be at todays rally or near attendees and elected officials as previously announced all rally attendees are given

lsu official football player quarantines were anticipated|lsu has begun asking a number of football players to selfquarantine in the past week because of instances in which some players tested positive for covid19 after social interactions outside of the tigers training facility “this is what we anticipated we planned for this our plan is working the way it should” senior associate athletic director of health and wellness shelly mullenix told the associated press on saturday adding that none of the players have exhibited “significant” symptoms “we havent seen anything even close to a bad illness but were prepared for that” mullenix said “what we have right now is quite manageable” mullenix declined to specify the number of players whove tested positive for covid19 or the precise number of those asked to quarantine stressing that the number is fluid and can fluctuate considerable in short periods of time but she emphasized that a single positive test could result in as many as twelve to fifteen players being asked to initially quarantine because of lsus contact tracing procedures several media reports have attributing specific numbers to unnamed sources but mullenix called those numbers “inaccurate” “if our quarantine number is high it means our players have been communicating not only where theyve been and whove theyve been with but also their symptoms as we instructed them to” mullenix said some schools have released figures on covid19 testing on friday clemson said twentyeight athletes or staff members have tested positive since returning to campus june 8 last weekend louisiana tech said it had one positive test mullenix said lsu has been working closely with state health officials who would be able to suggest that the football program make changes or even halt workouts at its baton rouge louisiana campus if they saw a need for that “were fortunate in what were seeing” mullenix said “if they were to ask us to close down that would be evidence that weve crossed some threshold thats too difficult to manage” lsu players began reporting to the oncampus training facility during the first week in june for antibody testing and physicals strength training and conditioning began the following week with social distancing rules that limited the number of players in the weight room to twenty at a time at regularly sanitized and spacedapart racks each rack contains all weights needed for the days workout so theres no need for players to cross paths or take turns using the same equipment the racks are sanitized between each use and lsu also has set up machines like those in hospitals which circulate air through viruskilling ultraviolet light also players must answer a series of questions and have their temperature scanned before they may enter the facility “were monitoring it on a daily basis” mullenix said “were catching people with temperature or symptoms where we want to catch them right at the entrance and were able to quarantine people before they even get into the facility” mullenix said lsus combination of testing for antibodies and active disease as well as contact tracing has enabled the university to virtually rule out transmission occurring at oncampus football facilities but she noted that lsu always expected at least some players and possibly coaches to contract the virus throughout the year particularly as they go about their lives outside of football “its a pandemic by definition it would have been foolish to think it wouldnt happen” she said but added “if these cases are accounted for then theres control which is different than if you had a bunch of cases popping up and had no idea where they were coming from “weve limited community spread slowed down spread through the team” she added “its a slow controlled burn the curve is flat and thats what you want” lsu the defending national champion is scheduled to open the season sept five against utsa in tiger stadium|2020-06-20|0.9868|positive|0.06455677220383103|positive

an antibody that neutralizes sarscov2|the covid19 pandemic is the biggest publichealth crisis in a century and the development of medical interventions to combat the sarscov2 coronavirus is a top priority writing in nature pinto et al1 provide evidence needed to take one of the crucial first steps for such efforts in the developing arena of antibody immunotherapy read the paper crossneutralization of sarscov2 by a human monoclonal sarscov antibody the level of protection provided by the immune system in response to sarscov2 exposure and infection is a hotly debated topic2 it is thought that one major arm of the immune response to such infection is the development of antibodies that recognize the virus of particular interest are antibodies that bind to a protein on the viral surface known as the spike protein coronaviruses derive their name from their distinctive crownlike coronal viral silhouettes which are due to these proteins antibodies that recognize and bind to the viral ‘spike can block its ability to bind the ace2 receptor protein on human cells an interaction between the spike protein and ace2 is part of a process that can enable coronaviruses to enter human cells thus antibodies that could hinder spikeprotein function would block infection such antibodies are termed neutralizing antibodies much remains to be learnt about the immunological responses to sarscov2 nevertheless it is becoming clear that antibodies taken from the blood serum of people who have recovered from covid19 can be used for treatment by being transfused into other people who have the disease3 such ‘convalescent sera approaches are highly attractive particularly as an immediate treatment option thats because moreconventional therapeutics such as drugs or vaccines are unlikely to be available for some time a more hightech approach to using convalescent sera is the manipulation of antibodyproducing b cells taken from the blood of people who had covid19 or other coronavirus infections each b cell makes one unique antibody and clonal populations of a b cell of interest can be used to generate an identical pool of a particular desired antibody known as a monoclonal antibody to accelerate the process of therapeutic development pinto and colleagues ‘went back in time and turned to samples of b cells collected from a person who had been infected by the coronavirus sarscov this virus which is similar to sarscov2 caused an outbreak in two thousand and three of a disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome sars the hope with such an approach is that the resemblance between the two viruses might mean that some antibodies that recognize sarscov also recognize and neutralize sarscov2 the ‘head or receptorbinding domain termed s1 of the spike protein is the most accessible region of the protein for antibodies to bind to however this domain exists in different dynamic states and debate has arisen over whether it is ‘masked from the immune

antibody rather as was the case for sars a synergistic approach combining different monoclonal antibodies in an antibody cocktail might be more effective5 for such approaches to move forwards evidence of effective antibody neutralization from in vitro studies will be needed along with in vivo data assessing how well an antibody can boost other aspects of the immune response — by enlisting other immune cells to tackle the infection for example there are many promising avenues to explore in these efforts pinto and colleagues got a head start with their work by exploring preexisting antibodies and they should now have more bcell populations to mine many other teams to give just some examples26–13 have also presented useful discoveries in the hunt for antibodies that can target sarscov2 the next steps will be to test individual antibodies and antibody cocktails in animal models to determine whether they offer protection and then to assess their safety and effectiveness in human clinical trials an accelerated path might narrow the time lag between antibody discovery and proofofconcept trials in humans to as little as five or six months14 the most recent prominent example of immunotherapy for infectious disease relates to battling the ebola virus in concert with vaccines and conventional smallmoleculedrug trials the development of monoclonalantibody therapies for ebola has progressed rapidly cocktails of antibodies beginning with one called zmapp that target a key ebola viral protein called gp in two crucial regions of the protein are continuing to be developed15–17 this progress in efforts to tackle ebola gives hope for similar immunotherapy achievements in targeting sarscov2 pinto and colleagues work marks a major step towards that muchanticipated and

virus this hope has not been in realised infected cases in africa south asia and latin america are still growing with latin america having surpassed the number of cases in europe and growing rapidly this column introduces a new ebook that describes the early work focusing on developing and emerging markets it concludes that the international community should step up by providing aid technical assistance and debt relief so that countries will not need to decide between saving lives and servicing their debts the covid19 pandemic started in china but soon moved to europe and to the us and by the end of march the number of cases in advanced economies had surpassed that in east asia at the beginning of the pandemic it was hoped that warm weather and younger populations would shield many developing countries from the virus however this hope has not been in realised infected cases in africa south asia and latin america are still growing with latin america having surpassed the number of cases in europe and still growing rapidly this is not only due to the fact that many developing and emerging countries are populous if we focus on cases per inhabitants in countries with a population of at least five million we find that about half of the countries in the list are developing or emerging market economies and these figures are likely to underestimate the problem as the number of reported cases is closely linked to testing capacity which is limited in many developing and emerging market countries notes black advanced economies the dashed line excludes the us gray east asia and pacific dark blue east europe and central asia light blue latin america and caribbean green middle east and north africa purple south asia red subsaharan africa the economic impact of the pandemic is global while in october 2019 the imf estimated that two thousand and twenty world gdp growth would be close to 34 the imf now forecasts that in two thousand and twenty world gdp will contract by 6 the global contraction affects every country covered by the imf forecasts the imf now expects that in two thousand and twenty there will only be sixteen countries with positive growth in gdp per capita for the sake of comparison in the aftermath of the global financial crisis nearly eighty countries registered positive growth in income per capita there is a large rapidly growing literature on the economic effect of covid19 in advanced economies for summaries see baldwin and weder di mauro 2020a 2020b and bénassyquéré and weder di mauro 2020 research that focuses on developing and emerging market countries is more limited in a new voxeu ebook we describe the early work focusing on developing and emerging markets djankov and panizza 2020 developing and emerging market countries differ from advanced economies in both the structure of the economy and the tools that can be used to implement macroeconomic policies aimed at reducing the amplitude and the economic costs of recession associated with the pandemic see the chapter by hevia and neumeyer the most important amplifying factors include • a large share of informal workers or workers employed in microfirms • a small share of jobs that can be done from home the ebook is divided into five sections the first three sections frame the problem present regional perspectives and discuss how the pandemic affects poverty inequality and informality the last two sections discuss policy responses and highlight the macrofinancial effects of the crisis including a narrative on the role of the international financial institutions the global economic impact of the pandemic is due to the fact that the economic risk of covid19 is distinct from its health risk the chapter by noy and coauthors compares these two risks and show that in some instances the two might be orthogonal this is especially the case for countries that have a small number of reported cases but are heavily reliant on tourism receipts and have fairly limited fiscal space for battling the ensuing recession djiofack and coauthors focus on africa and show that covid19 is likely to create a lasting impact on labour productivity they estimate that in an optimistic scenario african gdp would be permanently 1 lower than in the precovid scenario arezki and coauthors focus on the middle east and north africa unsurprisingly they show that low oil prices will have a negative effect on oilexporting countries growth however they also show that low oil prices will have a negative effect on oilimporting countries in the middle east and north africa because these countries will suffer from reduced foreign direct investment remittances tourism and official assistance levy yeyati and valdes show that there is substantial heterogeneity within latin america with peru and chile able to implement a sizeable fiscal reactions colombia mexico and uruguay with limited fiscal space and argentina brazil and ecuador with no access to private capital developing asia is an interesting case because as shown by abiad and coauthors it includes countries with very strict containment measures within the region east asian economies are expected to observe smaller contractions as these countries have been able to contain domestic outbreaks through aggressive testing and contact tracing and have avoided stringent containment measures however tourismdependent countries in the pacific subregion are expected to observe large drops in gdp even if none of these countries has had a significant outbreak the chapter by mooney and zegarra explicitly focuses on tourism and show that the impact of the covid19 pandemic on tourism flows to the caribbean is without precedent in terms of its speed and severity the second section of the ebook starts with a chapter by gómez and coauthors which uses data from the international coronavirus survey the chapter shows that in low and middleincome countries individuals report complying less with the containment measures and express higher levels of worries and depression with women being more worried and depressed than men perceptions are important because divergent beliefs about the ‘facts on the ground can be a source of social tension which can ultimately lead to conflict during economic crises berman and coauthors focus on conflict and using a counterfactual exercise find that that the lockdown has reduce conflict intensity in the short run but that the pandemic may amplify interreligious and interethnic tension and that violence may explode once mobility restrictions are relaxed the chapter by bosio and coauthors studies how long firms in a sample of thirtyfour low and lowermiddle income economies can survive without revenues they find that the median firm in a lowincome country can survive between six weeks and eighteen weeks and that in middleincome countries the median survival time ranges between seven weeks and eleven weeks this disturbing microeconomic picture leads to two predictions the potential for massive job losses and a rapidly growing budget deficit for 2002 2021 and perhaps some years after that to address the former topic cespedes and coauthors develop a model to show that the elimination of jobs in a pandemic is inefficient because of the interaction of two ingredients i while workers may be unproductive during the pandemic eliminating jobs harms productivity in the recovery and ii employers may be unable to preserve jobs during the pandemic because of frictions that limit the credit needed for paying the wage bill the third section of the ebook focuses on how the pandemic will affect informality inequality and poverty valensisi evaluates the effect of covid19 on global poverty using three different poverty lines 190day 320day and 550day and finds that the pandemic will erode much of the povertyreduction gains recorded over the last decade these estimates focus on changes in gdp and assume that the crisis will not affect income distributions however the pandemic is likely to increase income inequality as lessskilled people are often unable to work from home and are either more likely to suffer job loss or have to continue working outside home with a greater probability of being infected the chapter by furceri and coauthors uses data from past epidemic to estimate the effect of covid19 on inequality and job prospects their findings are in line with the hypothesis that the current pandemic could lead to a large increase in inequality which in turn will amplify its effect on poverty the chapter by nonvide evaluates the economic policy responses implemented by selected african countries and shows that these measures often exclude informal workers which in africa account for 86 cent of total employment she suggests that cash transfer programmes and larger social assistance systems need to be a key component of the policy response in africa dhingra also focuses on informal workers and points out that income policies are hard to implement in developing countries a universal job guarantee programme is an appealing option for getting people back to work once the acute phase of the pandemic is over the chapters in section four of the ebook focus on some of the policy responses in the postcovid recovery phase these include job protection bircan and coauthors work from home gottlieb and coauthors the protection of exportoriented firms woodruff the streamlining of bankruptcy procedures balloch and coauthors regulatory reforms to increase firm productivity djankov and

the virus can damage lung liver and kidney tissue grown in the lab which might explain some severe covid19 complications in people|researchers are growing miniature organs in the laboratory to study how the new coronavirus ravages the body studies in these organoids are revealing the viruss versatility at invading organs from the lungs to the liver kidneys and gut researchers are also experimenting with drugs in these mini tissues to see whether such therapies might be candidates to treat people physicians know from hospitalised patients and autopsies that sarscov2 can have a devastating effect on organs but its unclear whether some of this damage is directly caused by the virus or by secondary complications of the infection multiple groups are using organoid studies to show where in the body the virus travels which cells it infects and what damage it does “the beauty of organoids is that they resemble the true morphology of tissues” says thomas efferth a cell biologist at johannes gutenberg university of mainz germany coronavirus and covid19 keep up to date virologists typically study viruses using cell lines or animal cells cultured in a dish1 but these dont model sarscov2 infection well because they dont mimic what happens in the body say researchers organoids better demonstrate what sarscov2 does to human tissue says núria montserrat a stemcell biologist at the institute for bioengineering of catalonia in barcelona spain they can be grown to include multiple cell types and take the shape of the original organ in weeks says montserrat theyre also less expensive than animal models and avoid the ethical concerns they pose but studies of sarscov2 in organoids have limitations because they do not reflect the crosstalk between organs that happens in the body which means that findings will still need to be validated in animal models and clinical studies says bart haagmans a virologist at erasmus mc in rotterdam the netherlands one of the key insights from organoids is what sarscov2 does to cells in the respiratory system from the upper airway to the lungs kazuo takayama a stemcell biologist at kyoto university japan and his colleagues have developed bronchial organoids with four distinct cell types made from frozen cells from the outer bronchial layer or epithelium when his team infected the organoids with sarscov2 they found that the virus mainly targets stem cells that replenish cells in the epithelium known as basal cells but did not easily enter protective secretory ‘club cells2 the team which posted its work on biorxiv now plans to study whether the virus can spread from basal cells to other cells the boom in mini stomachs brains breasts kidneys and more from the upper airways the virus can enter the lungs and cause respiratory failure a severe complication of covid19 using mini lungs in a dish shuibing chen a stemcell biologist at weill cornell medicine in new york city has shown that some cells die after being infected and that the virus induces the production of proteins known as chemokines and cytokines3 which can trigger a massive immune response many people with severe covid19 experience an immune reaction known as a cytokine storm which can be deadly but chen who also posted her results on biorxiv says why lung cells are dying in patients remains a mystery — whether its because of damage caused by the virus selfinduced destruction or through being gobbled up by immune cells “we know the cells die but we dont know how” says chen whose approach to creating organoids was different from takayamas instead of creating them from adult cells she used pluripotent stem cells that can develop into any cell type in the body organoids grown in this way can include more cell types but the final result is less mature and so might not represent adult tissue says chen who is now growing lung organoids with immune cells from the lungs sarscov2 can spread to other organs but researchers werent sure how exactly the virus was travelling until montserrat and her colleagues published a study in cell in may4 in experiments in organoids also made from pluripotent stem cells they showed that sarscov2 can infect the endothelium — the cells lining the blood vessels — which then allows viral particles to leak out into the blood and circulate around the body pathology reports of damaged blood vessels in people with covid19 also support this hypothesis says josef penninger a genetic engineer at the university of british columbia in vancouver canada and colead author of the study5 studies in organoids suggest that once in the blood the virus can directly infect several organs including the kidney say penninger and montserrat although the virus infected kidney organoids and some cells died the researchers are not certain whether this is the direct cause of the kidney dysfunction observed in some patients another study in liver organoids found that the virus can infect and kill cells that contribute to bile production known as cholangiocytes many researchers thought that the liver damage seen in people with covid19 was caused by an overactive immune response or drug side effects says bing zhao a cell biologist at fudan university in shanghai china who published his results in protein  cell6 his work “suggests that the virus can directly attack the liver tissue which can cause liver damage” says zhao the virus can also replicate in the cells that line the small and large intestines known as enterocytes according to a science study that used gut organoids7 although such findings are illuminating using organoids to study the virus–host interaction is in its infancy says haagmans who developed the gut organoids “it is too early to say how relevant they are” he says more complex organoid systems are needed to better understand how the virus interacts with the bodys immune system to cause damage say researchers “we are fairly confident now that the virus that causes covid19 can infect tissue outside the lung and significantly contribute to disease” says penninger but more severe outcomes such as kidney and heart damage are probably due to a combination of viral infection and an excessive immune response he says scientists are also studying whether organoids can be used to model how drugs react in the body the hope is that organoids can be used to test potential covid19 therapies some of which have already been rushed through to clinical trials without extensive testing in cell and animal models labgrown ‘mini brains produce electrical patterns that resemble those of premature babies “due to the time sensitivity many clinical trials were designed based on previous knowledge of other coronaviruses and launched without careful evaluation in model systems” says chen “as a result many of them have failed” chen screened some 1200 drugs approved by the us food and drug administration for other illnesses and found that the cancer medication imatinib suppressed sarscov2 in lung organoids3 several human clinical trials of the drug as a treatment for covid19 have since been launched other groups are also testing existing drugs against the coronavirus in organoids with some success28 “we will only know at the end of this process what the predictive value of these systems are for testing drug efficacy” says haagmans “this is a longterm process”|2020-06-22|-0.9953|negative|0.05686232627022102|positive

next steps will be to test individual antibodies and antibody cocktails in animal models to determine whether they offer protection and then to assess their safety and effectiveness in human clinical trials an accelerated path might narrow the time lag between antibody discovery and proofofconcept trials in humans to as little as five or six months14 the most recent prominent example of immunotherapy for infectious disease relates to battling the ebola virus in concert with vaccines and conventional smallmoleculedrug trials the development of monoclonalantibody therapies for ebola has progressed rapidly cocktails of antibodies beginning with one called zmapp that target a key ebola viral protein called gp in two crucial regions of the protein are continuing to be developed15–17 this progress in efforts to tackle ebola gives hope for similar immunotherapy achievements in targeting sarscov2 pinto and colleagues work marks a major step towards that muchanticipated and

over the turbulent past decade many legacy software players proved to be remarkably resilient now they must adopt a new strategic playbook to weather the different challenges ahead|for the past ten years the rise of software as a service saas has reshaped the enterprisesoftware industry during that period the disruptors that pioneered the model and the incumbents that transitioned to it created tremendous shareholder value between two thousand and eleven and 2018 the global software industrys market cap grew at twice the rate of the overall market yet that growth came with a cost industry profitability tumbled falling by half over the decade the next ten years will not be any less tumultuous as saas matures the customers expectations around ease of use and ease of doing business will continue to rise platforms as a service paas from the big three cloud vendors amazon web services google cloud and microsoft azure are gaining share and commoditizing software and with financial markets reeling from the covid19 pandemic investors are looking more closely at bottomline health addressing these demands will require software vendors to adopt a new playbook success will take a renewed strategic focus a willingness to expand “asaservice” offerings beyond subscription pricing and a greater emphasis on profitable growth see the sidebar “softwares new playbook” customers want saas products and an saas experience saas has become the default softwaredelivery model—and at breakneck speed exhibit 1 in 2010 saas offerings commanded just six percent of enterprisesoftware revenues by 2018 that share had grown to twentynine percent or 150 billion globally yet that figure understates the true size of the market when revenues from companies still transitioning to saas are counted the total asaservice share rises to seventyfive percent of all enterprisesoftware revenues or more than 380 billion those numbers mean that companies with no saas offerings now represent only onequarter of total industry revenues in a sign of the markets maturity late adopters have come on board more than onefifth of all government software spending now goes to saas even categories such as cad whose highly expert customer base would normally resist sweeping product changes are making the transition vendors that have not yet begun their saas transformation must do so now the “next normal” established during the covid19 pandemic will accelerate the footprint of saas given the growth of remote working the rapid deployment of digital solutions and the lower upfront costs to succeed with saas however vendors must do more than offer a subscriptionpricing model on a product hosted in the cloud they need to match the streamlined customerfriendly asaservice productdelivery experience with a similarly streamlined and customerfriendly endtoend journey right now the customer experience of many saas vendors often feels disjointed all too frequently for instance legacy billing processes and order forms riddled with confusing product terminology make it hard for customers to know what theyre paying for leading players address these inconsistencies by evaluating the whole business in the asaservice context and redesigning core processes to make them more intuitive and responsive exhibit 2 for example one software vendor launched a customersuccess organization as part of its move to a subscription product it also redesigned its quotetocash processes to simplify customer purchases and renewals this holistic approach contributed to an almost one hundred percent increase of its stock price over the eight quarters following the saas launch our own case experience shows that software vendors that embed an asaservice focus across key functions can improve total customer lifetime value by twentyfive percent through reduced churn and increased upselling and crossselling vendors may need to specialize at the top of the stack and to partner elsewhere in the 2020s the headline disruption for many software companies will be the growth of paas between two thousand and sixteen and 2018 paas revenues grew at nearly twice the rate of saas—44 percent a year versus twentysix percent respectively much of that growth came at the bottom of the software stack the big three cloud vendors with their vast scale and resources have developed paas services that now rival those of the leading software vendors the reach and financial muscle of the cloud giants allow them to innovate more quickly and to build and maintain these services at lower cost within the submarkets for systems infrastructure software sis and application development and delivery add the big three cloud vendors have seen their revenues grow by a compound annual rate of roughly sixtyfive percent between two thousand and fourteen and 2018 compared with just four to five percent for saas vendors exhibit 3 the rise of paas has changed what it takes to be a successful enterprisesoftware vendor as paas services become more sophisticated software application vendors have a tougher time justifying a price premium for products that could be delivered with a thin user interface on top of generic paas services with paas tools giving attackers and customers themselves the means to develop new applications quickly software vendors that do not innovate in kind will face increased risk software vendors need to defend their share of the profit pool by taking a clear look at where they have the best and most defendable opportunities to differentiate themselves rather than going headtohead with the big three one strategy is to specialize and tailor solutions to the needs of targeted verticals and use cases this strategy proved successful in the early 2010s when saas disruptors first entered the market the legacysoftware vendors that were closest to the customer and had a high degree of industry and domain expertise protected their market share and maintained their enterprise valuetorevenue multiples while customers that stressed differentiation on the basis of their technology were more vulnerable exhibit 4 another strategy is to provide a cloudagnostic experience for customers fearing cloud lockin some software customers are actively searching for add and sis tools that can work across their cloud deployments software vendors that meet this need quickly could unlock a value pool that the big three cannot touch still in order to maintain this position they will have to invest heavily to keep up with the big threes pace of innnovation a third option for vendors is to strike strategic partnerships for example when nuance communications developed its dragon ambient experience dax offering it chose to partner with microsoft nuance historically developed speech and ai applications inhouse and continues to do so however complementary technical expertise and datagovernance policies led nuance to partner with microsoft on dax by doing so nuance felt it could gain the benefit of investment at scale to advance stateoftheart developments addressing clinician burnout this technology partnership along with nuances strong healthcare expertise and datastewardship practices would provide the most significant longterm opportunities for differentiation and accelerate daxs time to market “the right partnership improves your agility to scale for value to maximize competitive advantages and to accelerate growth” nuance ceo mark benjamin told us “the huge upside potential in our core healthcare and enterprise markets necessarily attracts large cashrich competitors to truly differentiate they need to build buy or partner for domain expertise thats why we looked to partner under the right business construct and made a competitor a partner” with investors focused on profitability vendors need to optimize margins since dotcom days the conventional wisdom in software was that growth is king and profitability is secondary this mindset has shaped management behavior and investor attitudes in recent years however market sentiment has begun to shift revenue growth used to carry a premium of up to 25 times free cash flow but that gap has narrowed since 2015 saas natives have seen their growth premiums over free cash flow shrink to 17x meanwhile legacy software companies no longer receive a premium for growth over free cash flow exhibit 5 the focus on cash flow will only intensify in the covid19 era marginfocused initiatives must receive the right attention software leaders need to look function by function and identify areas where even modest restructuring can improve efficiency and the customer experience within sales for example many software accounts historically covered by field sales could be shifted to inside roles a transition that new remoteworking norms could accelerate our research shows that eighty percent of software buyers prefer remote sales over facetoface interactions if sales personnel spend less time on the road traveling to customer sites and meetings they can spend more time with customers our data show that moving to an insidesales model could reduce the cost of sales by as much as sixty to eighty percent per customer recognizing that potential some software organizations have begun shifting accounts as large as 200000 to an insidesalescoverage model businesses should also take a hard look at their product portfolios and winnow longtail offerings that have little to no chance of ever making it big to identify underperformers companies must go beyond topline numbers and get a complete picture of a products true profitability capturing the expense of maintaining a product in the sales bag preparing financial analyses processing invoices and undertaking other administrative tasks can surface the hidden costs of complexity and help leaders make more informed assetallocation decisions our research shows that software vendors that actively manage their portfolios and regularly divest underperforming products achieve enterprisevaluetorevenue multiples twice those of passive portfolio managers the
